No longer. The skies are filled with scales, our clouds dyed red by fire. The threat posed by dragons can be ignored no longer.Not all dragons are malevolent, far from it. Many have been benevolent, by their eyes. However, their power all too often poisons the well of their intentions. When they fly, the wind of their wings flattens crops. When they fight, the world shakes in the cataclysm. They regard us as ants, caring nothing for those of us they crush beneath them.We must bring them down, for our own sake. The lives and well-being of every race are at stake.A convocation of mages from the Red Sisterhood has set off to respond to this threat. We call all who would help us clear the skies to join us at our camp in the western reaches of the Free Plains- Raiko, High Priestess of the Cult of Storms", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://orig07.deviantart.net/4256/f/2007/269/9/d/flying_again_by_cryslara.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://orig07.deviantart.net/4256/f/2007/269/9/d/flying_again_by_cryslara.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/>"}, "post-18205": {"user": null, "user_num": null, "timestamp": "1449627986000", "message": "A rival at last!Ad ultimum proelium!", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "A rival at last!"}, "post-18207": {"user": "Quari Telsin", "user_num": 913, "timestamp": "1449629074000", "message": "I offer both my participation in this quest and a member of the Sisterhood!", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "I offer both my participation in this quest and a member of the Sisterhood!"}, "post-18236": {"user": "Jun of the Celadine", "user_num": 108, "timestamp": "1449638827000", "message": "Just to make things more interesting, I wanna play the role of opposition, actually side with the dragons and prevent innocent dragons from being killed.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Just to make things more interesting, I wanna play the role of opposition, actually side with the dragons and prevent innocent dragons from being killed."}, "post-18237": {"user": null, "user_num": null, "timestamp": "1449639158000", "message": "yey a friend", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "yey a friend"}, "post-18238": {"user": "Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui", "user_num": 102, "timestamp": "1449639301000", "message": "(Although damnit, I don't have a fem mage)", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.qkme.me/3tlgrp.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/NnoGhN1h.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"http://i.qkme.me/3tlgrp.jpg\" src=\"http://i.qkme.me/3tlgrp.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}}
