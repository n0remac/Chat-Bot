This is your chance to show off the latest dishes and traditional cuisine of your culture.Anyone who is interested please post here.

All participants should check in at one of the border threads. You don't need to wait for a response. A small summary of your goods and/or intentions and you can go right in. (If you're here to cause trouble, at least try to be subtle about it as you go through the thread).2. Once that's done, feel free to go crazy with describing your \"booth\" and cuisine, and feel free to interact with each other.3. Every booth will be visited at least once by some \"hungry guests\", who will judge the food. They're not too picky.4. The Festival will remain open for one week. At the end of the week, the best recipe as judged by the \"hungry guests\" will receive a prize.5. This is meant to be an \"international\" festival, so representatives from all governments, including the newer ones, (The Kingdom of Alban ,\u00a0The Kingdom of Belrow , etc) are highly encouraged to participate.6. You don't have to have a cuisine to participate. You can just come for fun.
