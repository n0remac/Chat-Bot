With no supplies except muscle and metal, they are forced to start from scratch and rebuild what they have lost. For them to survive and become a stable society, a series of quests will have to be undergone.\u00a0QUESTS: (Easy) Establishing a Camp - This quest has just started, but is still completely open. After waking up to the destruction, the vikings are cleaning up their mess. You will be helping with the gathering and cremation of the dead vikings, as well as building a camp. There's no combat involved in this quest.(Medium) The First Hunt -After building the camp and the cremation of the dead, the vikings must hunt or they will starve to death. Lacking tools to hunt with, you will be forced to use other items to capture food such as makeshift traps and makeshift spears(if any are made). This quest is based on survival and creativity. Can you survive t he hunt with nothing?(Hard) The First Raid - (Location currently unavailable)After the hunt (whether good or bad), it's time to gather supplies to build and grow. It is your duty to put your raiding skills to the test and provide for your Viking brothers and sisters. Survival is never guaranteed in a raid, so consider this a team-building excercise because soloists are not likely to survive. This raid will determine how the next series of quests will undergo.\u00a0(YOU MUST BE INVOLVED IN QUEST 1 or 2 TO JOIN RAID)CHARACTER SUBMISSION:thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/2399/systkin-ragnarokPOST HERE:thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/2395/norse-beginning?page=1&scrollTo=60367", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/2399/systkin-ragnarok", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/2395/norse-beginning?page=1&scrollTo=60367"], "image_list": [], "html": "After weeks and months, blistering heat and supernatural storms, vikings have landed!
