I have also increased my character gallery to TWO characters instead of one, and this is why I am making this thread.*Drum roll* This is my second character Flavia Bathory.I want to play out how her adult life started, before how she was turned to a vampire. But for that I will need a husband. He has to be much older than her and a wealthy and powerful man. Flavia is of noble birth and it is very unlikely that her father would marry her off to just anyone. He will have her virginity, as she is pure when the plot starts. But he will also have a wife who was forced into marrying him. I leave to you to decide if he chooses to stay married to Flavia or if he leaves her after a while. Both ways would make good plot. You should be aware that Flavia will not stay a faithful wife as I plan for her to become a seductress.\u00a0I also need a mother and a father for Flavia, but if this can't be achieved I have no problems using NP characters for these parts. The father's job is simply to marry off his young beautiful daughter to a man much older than herself. Flavia will be unwilling to this marriage, so she needs to be forced. This is essential, since it will be among the things that triggers her cruelty later on.I also want to describe how she was turned into a vampire when attending to a ball after her best friend's wedding. In my novel I have written that she was raped and bitten/turned, so I need a vampire who may be willing to do both. I am open to if we wish to play this out or if we merely insinuate that bad things has happened.Last, but not least: Flavia is a seductress, and she will need men willing to fall for her captivating charms. She needs men willing to give her vital information about enemy troops and other important political things in return for sex.She will also need important men of high rank and powers willing to pay for the information she can bring them. Men who will have her in their service. She will be willing to sleep with these men if this is requested.As Flavia is a social butterfly, she will also be happy to get female friends.If anyone is interested, feel free to leave a reply in this thread, or send me a PM. I am open for anything. Thank you so much in advance! *Group hugs*", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Hello everyone!"}, "post-13792": {"user": "[Phoenix] Zaltos Kiraxo", "user_num": 29, "timestamp": "1445099803000", "message": "I'll send one of Demigrem's mages from Labefacto.
