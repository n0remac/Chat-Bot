The purpose of the task force would be to hunt down dangerous individuals, monsters, and other creatures that are causing havoc and destruction throughout the land. Such targets would then either be brought back to the Tower and questioned or, if capturing them is out of the question, terminated on the spot.This task force would have a good deal of freedom in its actions. As long as they complete their mission and follow the few basic guidelines in place, they are free to bring such targets to justice with whatever methods they find appropriate. The task force is willing to take on both humans and nonhumans, even non-humanoid creatures assuming they will follow the guidelines.Those in the task force will receive a number of benefits. First off, they will receive a yearly salary, paid in gold. They will also gain a bounty whenever they complete a mission. In addition to this, they will be provided lodgings in the Black Tower and have access to its facilities and resources. Such resources would include things like specialized equipment for missions, intelligence information the tower has, and use of the golems to assist in the apprehending of subjects.While not needed, members of the task force are free to do as they please. When contacted for assistance however, they are expected to assist unless the mission is outside of their capabilities. Due to the danger many of the missions place the task force members in, it is recommended only those with appreciable combat skills join. However, those with other skills outside of combat but still useful for the task force in some other area like intelligence gathering or scouting are welcome to join as well.Any wishing to join this task force should approach the Black Tower which is just outside of the Free City.

Members of the task force can also request a certain target be made a mission themselves if they run across any dangerous individuals or monsters.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The Black Tower is seeking to form a task force made up from a variety of adventurers, warriors, mages, and magical creatures.
