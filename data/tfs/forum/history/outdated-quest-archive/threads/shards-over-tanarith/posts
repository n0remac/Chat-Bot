It's prosperity and power was all thanks to a huge mysterious crystal which floated over the city. The crystal provided the city's citizens with magical powers allowing them to create an advanced society founded upon the practical use of magic. For two hundred years Tanarith grew and prospered in peace until cataclysm changed everything. On that fateful day the giant crystal fell from it's perch in the sky smashing into the city below. The city was destroyed and most of it's occupants were killed. Now the city lays ruined and abandoned, just waiting for adventurers to come along and piece together the shattered shards of the Tanarith crystal to reclaim is awesome power.So basically, as people have been wanting something to do, I thought i'd throw together a side story/campaign on a small, manageable scale open to anyone who wishes to join. You are the leader of a small band of adventurers/mercenaries/heroes/villains or whatever who has ventured to the ruins of Tanarith in search of the shards of the great crystal which are rumored to still grant the holder great powers. You will have almost complete control over the theme and flavor of your warband be it a band of morally grey sellswords or a group of zealots driven to collect the shards to offer to their benevolent God. Each warband will be roughly ten to twenty members in size and will be one of the many factions vying for dominance over the ruins of the once great city. As this is to be a side project all accounts will be made especially for this event and will be named after your warband not the individual in command. Before creating the account reply below filling in the template provided and await approval.\u00a0As leader of this project i will be DMing/Judging and will not be entering a warband. I will be judging conflicts, events and general RP on both realism and how compelling and exciting it is. Over a series of said encounters i will be awarding shards that can be used to further aid your efforts in the campaign. As mentioned before this is a side campaign and the loss of characters and perhaps whole warbands is to be expected. This is primarily for fun and also for those of you who wish to show off your RP skills in a competitive environment.\u00a0A couple of rules regarding your warbands:No Magic - As the Crystal shattered it destroyed the areas source of magic making it the zone a magic free zone with magic from the shards being the only exception.No Perfect Warbands - Your warbands must have clear strengths and weaknesses as to make the campaign fair and interesting.Roughly Humanoids - Your warband may be of any race/origin you wish as long as they are not immortal gods or w/e. Stronger, more powerful races will be allowed but they will start with smaller numbers. The same goes for more elite or better equipped warbands. The rough number will be 15 averagely equipped and skilled humans.\u00a0Respect my decisions - Please, when i decide who won a conflict, don't be bitter about it. While i welcome some structure criticism please don't PM me with an all caps message on how you deserved the win. While you may have actually lost the conflict slightly, if your RP was of better quality, realism or more captivating to read I may award a draw or a win in your favour.Not linked to current factions - While your warband may be sent from one of the existing governments the city of\u00a0Tanarith is located far to the east of the continent meaning it would take a long time to reach it. You may not call on aid from anyone or anything outside the city once we begin such as calling for reinforcements or summoning creatures unless it is specifically written into your warband description and accepted by myself. None of the relics won in this campaign may be taken out of the city once it has been completed. The shards will be powerful and potentially government breaking beyond the confines of the ruined city.\u00a0If your interested but not completely hooked reply here with any questions you may have and i will do my best to answer them. If three or more people apply with their warbands it will be going ahead. Please fill out the following form and reply here if you wish to participate.\u00a0Warband Name: (The name of your warband)Description: ( A brief description of your warband's motivation, leadership, equipment, races, skill level, organisation etc. Anything about them which the other participants and i should know. 2 Paragraphs Min*.\u00a0*If your warband contains anything other then humans you will have to write an additional paragraph for each race that is not human detailing their physiology and such.)Strengths:\u00a0Weaknesses: (Three of each strengths and weaknesses are required along with a sentence or two to explain/justify the strength/weakness.) \u00a0Current WarbandsThe Ravers", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/post/4773"], "image_list": ["http://i.picresize.com/images/2015/06/24/p21UF.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://i.picresize.com/images/2015/06/24/p21UF.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/></div>"}, "post-4773": {"user": "Bandon Lorik", "user_num": 388, "timestamp": "1435187818000", "message": "Warband Name: The RaversMember Count: 18Description:  The Ravers live for pleasure, chaos, and violence.  They want to blaze a trail through the land devouring and taking all enjoyment they can.  The are lead by Harold the Horrid, a.k.a. Horrid Harry, Horrific Horrid Harry, Harold the Horrifically Horrid, Horrid Harry the Horrific, Larry the Liar, etc. (you get the idea). They are equipped with some of the most ill maintained weapons and armor taken from their victims.  It seems not a one of them has forethought.  They are assembled from the dredges and cast offs of society.  Anyone willing to follow Harry Larry the Lunatic is probably a bit mad themselves.  As such they are mainly human and human mixed bloods.  Most of them are not very skilled but rather bloodthirsty and unrelenting, attacking with fury leaves them open, but often times the prey is to overwhelmed to take advantage.  They swarm like a pack of rats or wolves and have no concept of a 'fair fight'.  Once they are engaged even Harold often can't turn his dogs back.     Harold seeks the crystal shards for power.  He has a mad dream of becoming a god and plunging the world into chaos and insanity.  The Ravers are a blight on all they encounter and most even die to infighting, often replaced by one of the shattered survivors of their raids.  Thieves, liars, cannibals, what have you, Harold turns away none with a thirst for blood and an addled mind.  Some of his followers are true believers seeing him as a god in the making of sorts. Strengths: Reckless Savagery, Unrelenting Spirit, Swarm Tactics.  They are truly savage attacking with no regards to themselves and aiming to inflict as much pain as possible.  They will not give up until dead, no broken bones or lost limbs will stop them from trying to kill.  They have fought many times with each other and are surprisingly efficient when swarming the same target.Weaknesses: Raving Mad, Fools Defense, No Plans.  The Ravers are just that, raving lunatics, they will often draw outlandish conclusions from random clues or be totally oblivious to anything happening outside of their focus.  The same tactics that give them strength also leave a few of them quiet vulnerable.  Beyond swarming targets and killing the closest enemy the Ravers don't give much thought to strategy, if killing doesn't work, they try to kill harder.Read more: thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/428/shards-over-tanarith#ixzz3e1RVDQ8b", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/428/shards-over-tanarith#ixzz3e1RVDQ8b"], "image_list": [], "html": "Warband Name: The Ravers"}, "post-4775": {"user": null, "user_num": null, "timestamp": "1435188263000", "message": "Welcome aboard.

Capricious, mercurial, beings, the faeries of the troop act on whim, playing pranks on travelers and accosting enemies from the shadows. They are led by the Unseelie Lord Nix, a proud, calculating prankster.  Once powerful illusionists and masters of defensive magic, the faeries are now thoroughly mundane, and angry about it! Restoring the shards is their prerogative, as it would allow them to regain their power. Their ultimate goal would be to use the magic of the shards to open a portal to the Fae Realms they originated from, unleashing more of their kind into reality.Each of the troop-member stands somewhere between seven and eleven inches tall. They flutter about on translucent wings that resemble those of butterflies. In combat speed and flight are the faerie's chief assets. They are practiced at dodging the clumsy slashes and swipes of mortals, and are so thin it is hard to hit them as they flit about, harrying their foes. Their small size is both their greatest strength and their greatest weakness: compared to a man a pixie has very little strength, and a single good blow will almost certainly take any pixie out of the fight (unless their armor saves them.)In battle the pixies rely on coordinated tactics to surround single foes and bleed them with strikes to the vitals. They wield spears and long, piercing swords in combat, neglecting any shields. Their armor is light but very solid: often if a faerie is hit directly he is struck like a ball from a bat rather than being bisected. Their leader nix carries a rapier as a sidearm and a lance as his primary weapon. He rides a falcon into combat: the two work as a single cohesive unit.
