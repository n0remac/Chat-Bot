Thus the creation of \" The second Tower\"\u00a0 For those who know of me, I enjoy some slower roleplays that focus on players attention to small\u00a0 details, suspense and world building more often than combat.\u00a0 So if you enjoy a good spook, a few head scratches, or some outright chills feel free to swing by. With this being the second iteration of my \"Tower of Eons\" I've felt the need to restructure somethings and present them in a slightly different manner.\u00a0 The original Tower was going to be a two part dungeon crawler , one portion being very Standard story based RPG and the second being a bit more DnD like. I've got several pages of traps, items, and other goodies still sitting around that I never really got to use due to my hiatus.What I'd like to do with this Tower is more akin to the typical Story based RP we see on TFS but I want to add some Puzzle elements to this. I'd like to see players think and be observant while within the tower rather than trying to hack and slash through or just blindly wandering.To help me stay on top of things however I do not plan to run more than 3 Story's within the tower.\u00a0 A story can consist of any number of people( writers)\u00a0 but I'd like to see the group sizes stay relatively small for ease of writing and flow.\u00a0\u00a0 We can add or introduce or subtract characters nearly at whim.
