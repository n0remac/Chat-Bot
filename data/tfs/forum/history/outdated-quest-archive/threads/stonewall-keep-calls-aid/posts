We are but a small, fledgling state struggling to cling on to our existence among the ruins of the old world. While my men are stout of heart and strong of arm we lack the resources and capabilities to deal with the threat which we currently face. It comes down to I, Lord Farand, as the leader of my people, to call for aid from the adventurers of the land in the hope that they may tip the tide of battle in our favor so that my people and I may settle these broken lands peacefully. For those who's interests have been peaked I can promise you payment in gold, titles, land and other worldly possessions should you prove to be a valuable asset to our cause along with the respect and hearts of my people should we overcome our foe. \"~ The letter is stamped with an ornate orange wax seal; Lord Farand's official seal.This is to be the first of many Stories/Campaigns/Plots for those with a thirst for adventure with a nice strong D&D approach to the play by post medium.\u00a0This is going to be a low magic story. If your character has strong magical powers and/or magical items they will not be allowed to participate in this adventure. If you have minor magical abilities and/or feel strongly that you wish to join this event PM me so we can discuss your powers with the end goal of finding an acceptable medium including limitations and effects of your powers.If your interested reply below out of character. When enough people have replied to show interest I will post the starting topic in the Overworld.Only apply if you intend to remain active and see the story through; It will be fairly lengthy. However I do understand there are sometimes unavoidable circumstances and as such I will be adding a mechanic for working around absences. By replying below you agree to this mechanic which will essentially involve your character phasing in and out of existence according to your activity with a myriad of random effect possible. Any from sustaining wounds from battling demons on a different plane to forgetting what happened the past couple of days.\u00a0I would encourage creating new, well thought out and detailed characters for this as they almost\u00a0definitely\u00a0will face countless perils and dangerous.Sign UpsRena - Alden -\u00a0Aras S.
