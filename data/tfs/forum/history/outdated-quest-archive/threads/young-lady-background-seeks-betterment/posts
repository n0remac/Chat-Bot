As one can imagine, I am now in less than desirable circumstances and seek employment in a noble household. I am able to read, write, do sums, and teach proper etiquette to children as a governess. I am also able to practice healing arts if a nursemaid is needed in your household.I am the only daughter of a Duke, and was given a wonderful education that was spared no expense. I am a proper young lady with a sound reputation, as I spent my youth in cloister with women of religion. I assure you that I would make a most dedicated governess or nurse for your household.You can find me in Travere, I do not currently have accommodations. Please help, I urge you.Sincerely,Lady Faisine\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "RP Type: Possible romance, funny"}, "post-53167": {"user": "Dantess Visconti", "user_num": 1110, "timestamp": "1476172681000", "message": "Faisine may one day receive a letter in return...The mail arrived with a monetary gift: coin of decently high value, enough to make a comfortable journey southbound, or anything else she deemed important.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/PlD8pqD.png", "https://www.puzzleclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/Bolsa-de-monedas.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\">Faisine may one day receive a letter in return...<br><br/><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/PlD8pqD.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/><br/><br/>The mail arrived with a monetary gift: coin of decently high value, enough to make a comfortable journey southbound, or anything else she deemed important.<br/><br/><br/><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.puzzleclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/Bolsa-de-monedas.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/></br></div>"}, "post-53186": {"user": "Faisine of the Usque", "user_num": 46, "timestamp": "1476198706000", "message": "Fai currently sits in a tavern, baffled by this letter, and is now trying to decide.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Fai currently sits in a tavern, baffled by this letter, and is now trying to decide."}, "post-53260": {"user": "Faisine of the Usque", "user_num": 46, "timestamp": "1476238944000", "message": "He shall receive a reply as soon as it can get to him.Dearest Lord Visconti,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Imagine my surprise when a boy brought your missive to me along with a sum of money even my father would have liked to hold at one time. I find myself intrigued, though reluctant to leave the safety Gauldin has to offer... After all, I am cousin to the Princess Camilla, the poor dear. If I go, it could possibly alienate me further from the only family I have, as it would be seen as being disloyal. However, I have already offended Her Highness without meaning to, and I fear she would turn me away if I were to ask for coin. I nearly wrote apologetically to you and returned all but a few coins that I had given to those who carried these letters to and fro. I could not accept the coin if I were to stay.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 With that being said, I fear you are the only one to have come to my aid at this point. What am I to do but to accept your offer of employment if you'll still have me after my candor, my lord? I will book passage posthaste, and outfit myself properly to befit my new station in life. Please understand my reluctance, but I assure you that I shall see you soon.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 I've enclosed a portrait enamel of me so that you know whom to approach.Yours humbly,F.
