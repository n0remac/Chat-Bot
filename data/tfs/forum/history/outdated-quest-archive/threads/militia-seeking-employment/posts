A large valley filled with rivers, lakes, hills, fens, and forests. Its northern border is also near the coast, with plains to the south. Consisting of various barbarian tribes, Blood-Chimera though rare also fill its ranks, and somewhat more common are Zoanthropes. A society has been established. Highly trained in guerilla-warefare, hit-and-run tactics, and direct warefare with a heavy emphasis on training at the earliest of ages in order to deal with the harsh environment, as winters are very unforgiving in the Olfwood Valley. There are also occasionally shaman and magicians within these lands that are involved in the militia as well but male magicians are less tolerated than female ones. The land itself seems rife with ancient powers, causing many strange phenomenon as well. These Mercenaries can raid nearby settlements and nations, but are also highly shrewd and will ally themselves as mercenaries if the pay is good, and the job is compatible with their code. Fenris their leader seeks to employ them. A band of Mercenaries for potential hire seeking action.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The Reaver Militia"}, "post-16478": {"user": "Grand Komtur: Giplor Vauc'Tutt", "user_num": 648, "timestamp": "1447854840000", "message": "That land location is unavailable.
