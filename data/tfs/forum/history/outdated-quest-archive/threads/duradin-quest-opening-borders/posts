It is written four times; once in Orcish, once in English/Common, once in Elven, and again in Dwarven. The letter essentially requests the alliance of those nearby to make trade with Targel. It excludes any mention of war benefits or political matters, only wishing to start the bridges for the common health and welfare of the civilians and the supplies for such. Should you be a person of importance for a hold that is South of Duradin, Morvo humbly awaits your response.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<b>Targel, the Enlightened Tribe, is looking to make trade routes and allies with cities along its southern borders.</b>"}}
