The few who have often readily dismiss it save for a few smaller traders. However, as of late more and more caravans have disappeared in entirety when passing by Blackbark. In particular, this has gained the annoyance of textile trade magnate John Markusson. As a result, major cities and travel destinations would find a magical paper flying by or attached to billboards. To all readers, I humbly ask of you to travel to the town of Blackbark and investigate the town for oddities. There are no reports of bandit activity, but an ever larger area to avoid grows around the town. Take this paper with you, and report your discoveries in direct speech to it. Whomsoever discovers the cause will be awarded with a magical artifact of their choosing from my collection, with an additional one in store for those involved in ending this plague upon the world's economy. OOC: This quest is to be a mixture of investigative and combat interactions, characters should be a somewhat intermediate power level, standing little chance if particularly lowly while being reductive if particularly strong. Expect posts about every other day, though depending on player actions and desires may be resolved quickly, or might take an extensive period of time. If one desires to participate, simply arrive at the town stating that you had received the paper and are going to investigate.
