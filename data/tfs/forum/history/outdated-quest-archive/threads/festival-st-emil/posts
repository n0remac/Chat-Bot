Come all you in love, come express your sheer joy in being with one another!The festival has origins in old St. Emillian standing up to an Emperor of old who forbade him from marrying people without the consent of the state. So, he blessed one of his many nephews to let him fly, and let the boy go forth and marry lovers with an invisible arrow of the sweetest scent, dipped in dew of the fern flower. People in Vlaanze celebrate it yearly just before spring's poppies bloom, which is seen by them as marriage of Winter and Summer. In the time of the festival the Vlaanzen aptitude for delicate things like mechanisms and sweets truly goes to show. They make the finest of chocolates and other confections for couples to enjoy, they breed perhaps the finest roses and tulips in the world, and just for the occasion set up massive ferris wheels or set up romantic boat rides (accompanied by music) on the waterways of the city. \u00a0Of course, much fun is to be had in the villages and surrounding fiefdoms too. One only has to head out for an hour's walk outside of the city-state to find a rural area where the ancient practice of seeking out the fern flower is observed. The legendary flower of a fern is an ancient and magic artifact that is said to give true, material power to one's emotions. Every year couples (or those looking for love) go out to a forest to find the flower, and although this is usually a euphemism for couples to get a chance to consummate their love many wizards and other such folk venture in to woods to look for it too knowing the part of the myth that where the flower is, so life, live and happiness will bloom and spring instantly.The Festival will begin on the tenth of February, and all peoples of the world are welcome be it to have fun, to express love, or to find it.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://www.animatedimages.org/data/media/409/animated-cupid-image-0022.gif", "https://macaudailytimes.com.mo/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/03.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/meQVmfv.jpg", "https://img00.deviantart.net/8439/i/2012/321/f/1/fern_flower_by_mpsapfir-d5l9jcz.jpg", "http://www.fun-lover.com/clipart/gifs/valentines/cupids/68.gif"], "html": "<div align=\"center\"></div>"}}
