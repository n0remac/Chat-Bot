My name is Meredith and I am 29 years old. Life here is soooo boring. This letter is a way of reaching out to something new. Every day is a dull and unchanging monotony. I will spare you the details but basically, I must politely make my way through the same social customs every day, all the while knowing the result. My step-father is very protective of me so I am unable to even leave the grounds. This is the only way I could think to form a contact. Surely, if you send a letter to me, Father will let me respond.The grounds of the castle are large and beautiful. There is a brook and a small wood with many birds. But they can fly away unlike me. My real father was the true king, my step-father killed him and took the thrones. Now I am a captive piece on a Game of Generals board. But this life is manageable and has its merits. I am far from unhappy. It could be far worse.Anyways, I am more interested in your life. How are you doing? What do you do each and every day? Where did you come by this letter? Is your life exciting? Have you ever seen a goblin, or a giant, or a dragon? Are there really brave knights and powerful wizards in faraway lands? I wonder if I will ever receive a response. Should this letter even make it into\u00a0your hands it will be a miracle. If I am so lucky you must send your response in a coded message. When answering my questions you must pretend to be a very wealthy suitor, seeking my hand in marriage. Remember, we have never talked before. This is the only way my father will ever let me send a letter and I don\u2019t think the bottle will make it to you twice~Meredith Al****nTelian KingdomThe Goraian IsleP.S.

Despite the weather, a party of mounted men rode along the shore on stout little horses, save one who was too tall for them. He instead was mounted on great dapple grey draft horse, and even then he made it look like a normal sized horse compared to its rider. Wrapped in his green cloak,\u00a0 he sat up in the saddle with a noble bearing, his blonde hair flowing freely onto his shoulders.\u00a0He was the first to notice the glinting in the sand, as a ray of sun poked through long enough to hit the glass bottle. Spurring his steed to a trot, because it refused to gallop, he leaned sideways in the saddle and grabbed the bottle without stopping. Straitening himself in the saddle, he brought the bottle to his lips and pulled out the cork with his teeth. Holding the cork in the side of his mouth, he tried to read the letters on the piece of paper. Finally quitting out of frustration he rode back to the party, and handed the bottle, cork, and paper over to another man, having to lean down because of the distance, \"Bard! What does it say!\" he ordered in a gruff, deep voice.\u00a0The other man read the letter word for word, squinting his eyes at the smudged last name, trying to discern what it could've been. \"I'm sorry, I'm not able to make out that name. And I don't even know what kingdom Telian is. Or where Goraian is. But,\" he held up the wine bottle, \"this is evidently a rich place, because this is a well made bottle, and they just dumped it in the ocean without a care.\"The first man rubbed the beard on his chin, contemplating on what to do. \"Rich, eh? Fine, I'll respond. You know what you're doing Bard, I trust you'll make up something flowery,\" he ordered as he turned his horse back around, and went back to the trail. The Bard, meanwhile, pulled out a quill and a piece of parchment, and wrote with a practiced hand:\"Dearest Meredith,Your letter and well wishes has found its way to Annan Ap Owen, a warrior of great renown and respect among his peers. He has felt 35 winters come and go, and none have marred his handsome features. As a warrior, he has a great fortune earned by the spoils of great battles and brave exploits, so if your father wishes to have a rich suitor, look no further.\u00a0Most of my days are spent in the saddle, traveling from one land to the next, looking for further quests to earn immortality through my feats. And yes, I have seen many goblins, and giants, though I haven't seen many dragons, or else I may not be able to write this letter to you. There are many wizards in this land, though knights are far from the Toragana mountains, though there are a few interlopers from Isra and Voruta.\u00a0The Castle sounds like a quiet and lonely place, one that needs to be remedied. Where is the Isle of Goraian, so I may better understand your life, and know where I may begin my courtship and send the sweets? Is it a long trip by ship, or would it only take a few days?Yours Truly,Annan Ap Owen.\"The Bard then resealed the wine bottle with the cork, and threw it out to sea, watching it being carried out by the retreating tide.", "link_list": ["/user/3025"], "image_list": [], "html": "<span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-3025 group-0\" href=\"/user/3025\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@meredith\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Meredith</span></a></span>"}, "post-82582": {"user": "Meredith", "user_num": 3025, "timestamp": "1525590575000", "message": "An inconspicuous poster calls  adventure seekers and treasure hunters to find a ship bound for the Telian Kingdom.
