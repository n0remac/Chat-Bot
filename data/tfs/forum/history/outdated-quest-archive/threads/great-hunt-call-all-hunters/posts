It is celebrated with a great feast in Vanskaar Mead Hall but before that comes to pass the bravest warriors in and outside of Taingaard must compete to show their worth in The Great Hunt. This is equally er great opportunity for foreign ambassadors to come and experience Taingaard - if not participating in The Great Hunt - then for socializing and tasting the great food and wine Taingaard has to offer.\u00a0\u00a0The tradition of The Great Hunt draws warriors from near and far to try and hunt down and kill the foulest beast they can find in Taingaard - either single handedly or in teams of up to three. Prizes will be given to all hunters, but the main prize will be quite something!The three tains are handing out the scores and points are awarded for \"Overall Foulest Beast\", \"Biggest Challenge in Relation to The Group\" and \"Style\". Bonus points for felling a beast that is still to be classified in their records. Each group will be followed by a raven that transmits the progress of the teams directly to the tains that act as judges - all thanks to the immaculate magic of the Taingaard druids.\u00a0\u00a0Points are deducted for cowardly behaviour, an unrecognizable carcass, poor style and bad teamwork. Plus anything the tain might like to deduct points for.\u00a0 \u00a0Worthy warriors and hunters can join The Great Hunt by coming to Leifheim through Brynjefors Harbor\u00a0and entering\u00a0Vanskaar Mead Hall. Here the players must register their talents and skills and if they desire to hunt alone, as a duo or in a group of three. If the players don't already have someone they prefer to hunt along with, they will be assigned a partner if possible.\u00a0\u00a0Registration commences the 8th of January and all participants must be registered before the event takes place. The Great Hunt starts officially the 16th of January and the slain beast must be returned at the latest on the the 24th of January where the winner(s) are announced. After this there will be celebrations as long as one can remain upright - and for some even after that point...\u00a0**** Anyone entering Taingaard between now and the 24th of January may enter directly after posting at Brynjefors Habor and DO NOT have to wait for a post to confirm entry. You may also skip posting at the city gates! ****Rules:\u00a0- The Great Hunt must be ended within a week after it commences\u00a0- The slain beast must be brought back afterwards in the state it was slain\u00a0- It is strictly prohibited to act against ones team mates in a way that endangers their well being\u00a0- It is also prohibited to spoil the efforts of an opposing team\u00a0", "link_list": ["https://flic.kr/p/2cFxzND", "https://flic.kr/p/2cFxzND", "https://www.flickr.com/photos/137813549@N06/", "https://flic.kr/p/2dZKVAS", "https://flic.kr/p/2dZKVAS", "https://www.flickr.com/photos/137813549@N06/", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/3238/brynjefors-habor-accesspoint-sea", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/3244/vanskaar-mead-hall", "https://flic.kr/p/23sVxcv", "https://flic.kr/p/23sVxcv", "https://www.flickr.com/photos/137813549@N06/"], "image_list": ["https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4850/45736122525_deaea6c4d0_o.jpg", "https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4806/46598584162_5ddf134db8_o.jpg", "https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4891/39686080863_d203b2822c.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:left;\"><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><b><font face=\"verdana\" size=\"7\">The Great Hunt\u00a0</font></b></div><br><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><font><a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/2cFxzND\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4850/45736122525_deaea6c4d0_o.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/></a><a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/2cFxzND\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/137813549@N06/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></font></div><br/></br></div>"}, "post-88305": {"user": "Kord Vanskaar", "user_num": 3108, "timestamp": "1546896970000", "message": "Kord Vanskaar will take your registration right here!
