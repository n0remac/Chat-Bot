I intend for Fairoborough to be a kind of gruff seen-it-all type of guy with a few clever tricks up his sleeve for surviving as long as he has as a sellsword. His goal is to obtain enough prestige or gold to retire, regardless of his low birth. Though he has done a few morally grey things in his day, he also tends to fall on the side of the just most of the time, more a heart of silver (or bronze if the price is right) than a heart of gold. The character also has a pointed dislike of slavery, both because when he first left his village as an uneducated peasant slave labour made it hard for him to find a job and because he doesn't like the idea of being constrained himself and projects that onto the slaves, though he is only vaguely consciously aware of that. As for the setting, the regimented feeling of the society you had created would be interesting to negotiate socially. I think trying to bargain for a good price from a stuck up, entitled noble or one of their agents would make for an interesting role-play. Also, I would be interested in seeing a large variation of locales as you seem to have, as I pointed out in my last post, a fairly fleshed out setting. Finally, the idea of the \"Sunglass\" is really cool I think, I have always had a roleplaying love for strange mystical metals like Adamantite and Mithril.
