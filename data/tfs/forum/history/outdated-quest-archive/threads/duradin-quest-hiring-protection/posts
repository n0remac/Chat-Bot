What you hadn't heard was of civilized tribe called Krevis, where the mines ran deep and the crafts were splendid. But in the tavern there were notes posted upon the board of such a place, and it was requesting aid. The message was addressed to any mercenaries, travelers, or sellswords that wished to earn a fair bit of coin. All they had to do was travel to Krevis with the letter of hire, and fulfill the job, which was to escort cargo out and into the tribe. A fairly simplistic job, though the lands were barren and the beasts famished. It was completely up to you whether or not to accept this contract, though the reward was rather large.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<b>Krevis, the Tribe of Prosperity, is looking to hire a few select individuals to protect a shipment of supplies to a neighboring city along with the return shipment.</b>"}, "post-88232": {"user": "The Naimon Company", "user_num": 3104, "timestamp": "1546716313000", "message": "On the way", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "On the way"}}
