We've been travelling for two weeks, we need to at least fill up on supplies,\" says Markos with a stern look.\"But-\"\"If you die out there no one will be able to collect the damn scuttleflies.\"This seems to get her consideration. \"Alright, we'll ask for lodging and get a sample on the way out,\" she raises her eyebrows, \"I need my moss fresh and spongy.\"...As it usually turns out for her, climbing down a hill is a lot harder than climbing up. With Markos holding her hand she takes uneasy steps on the rocks, rather than grass slick with dew. The benefit of travelling for a long time is that your load gets lighter and lighter as you use up supplies, but she now just noticed that she had a grumbling tummy and only a biscuit as a ration. She doesn't complain, however, as she trusts Markos to handle the complicated matters of cooking food, not getting robbed and reminders to sleep. Her mind was full of scuttleflies, spongy moss, acidic tree bark and other such things. So was her journal.As they get closer it seems obvious there is some sort of fanfare. The busyness of the atmosphere is unwelcoming to Glynnis but Markos is happy to see other people whose minds aren't occupied entirely with their field of study. Glynnis is so focused on the other people that she walks into the back of a man stopped by some guards.
