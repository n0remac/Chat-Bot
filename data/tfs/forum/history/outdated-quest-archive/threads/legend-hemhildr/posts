As adventurers, skalds, and mercenaries from the northlands continue to migrate throughout the Overworld they bring with them tales of their people.One such tale is that of Hemhildr, a great hero from Valland Hold.  Wielding a legendary sword called Gormr, Hemhildr ventured into the mountains north of Wulfenhiem to slay the serpent Slivr.  The battle was long and arduous, and though Hemhildr overcame the serpent he would succumb to his wounds.  To prevent the mountain tribes from claiming Gormr, the folk say he cast his sword into a stone, asking the Old Gods to keep it safe until a worthy hero came to retrieve it.Those who wish to seek out this weapon must venture first to Wulfenheim, the capital of Valland.", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1293/wulfenheim"], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/botbop0.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><b><font size=\"5\">The Legend of Hemhildr\u00a0</font></b></div>"}}
