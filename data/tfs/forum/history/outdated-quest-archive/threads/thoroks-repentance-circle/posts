I hereby lift my walls of isolation to speak to those of power, be their intents evil or good. I call upon only the most powerful and brave of warriors to travel to Falkreath, within the lands of stone. Shall you come, you shall expect myself along with my advisors to speak upon private matters at hand. This shall be the only request by myself for the time being. All-Maker guide you, travelers.\"Thorok of Mathladeem, Chieftan of Falkreath, has called upon the lands to send their most powerful warriors as the tribe's years of Isolationism are over. Thorok's means for conducting business are unknown, but he appears to be calling for more powerful warriors than the average sword and spell. If you choose to come to Falkreath, you will be ordered to head straight to the Chieftan's Hut. That is all that's understood from this message, the business is not told and his intentions are unknown.Players recquired: 4-8", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-a0my2wjILSQ/UjfELHL_D1I/AAAAAAAAAUk/HeaE9jlRYl8/s1600/orcspear.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-a0my2wjILSQ/UjfELHL_D1I/AAAAAAAAAUk/HeaE9jlRYl8/s1600/orcspear.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/>"}, "post-21077": {"user": "Uncle Redding Roarin Fletcher", "user_num": 829, "timestamp": "1452628319000", "message": "You know Roarin's going be there got get sweet revenge on that cave.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "You know Roarin's going be there got get sweet revenge on that cave."}, "post-21078": {"user": "Roxanne Fletcher", "user_num": 472, "timestamp": "1452629804000", "message": "Roxanne will stumble upon it.
