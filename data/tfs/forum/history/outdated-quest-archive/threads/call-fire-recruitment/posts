Mazaloth, the Hellpyre, awoken and hungry for chaos and sovereignty. This is a call, to all who wish for a life of worth, servants to the great being. Should one wish to take up arms and join the Fire, they must travel afar, to the fields of ash and lava. Only there will one find Mazaloth's Mountain, an iron fortress crawling with demons and goblins. Shall you join them?-This is a recruitment Quest, held up here as an advertisement. If you wish to join the group, Mazaloth's Mountain\u00a0can be found in Open Lands.If you are interested in joining, all you need is a character around the neutral/chaotic/evil alliance. All are welcome, every race, every guild. However, likely no alliances will be made with other groups, but with a kingdom it is different.", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1438/mazaloths-mountain"], "image_list": ["http://wallpaperswa.com/thumbnails/detail/20120518/video%20games%20dragons%20world%20of%20warcraft%20fire%20horns%20fantasy%20art%20deathwing%20game%20cg%20artwork%20world%20of%20warc_wallpaperswa.com_97.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://wallpaperswa.com/thumbnails/detail/20120518/video%20games%20dragons%20world%20of%20warcraft%20fire%20horns%20fantasy%20art%20deathwing%20game%20cg%20artwork%20world%20of%20warc_wallpaperswa.com_97.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/>"}}
