Originally, I wanted it to involve me and another commander, and our actions were to be judged by an outside mediator.  But if others are wanting to get involved, I would be okay with that.I'm not concerned about what happens afterwards; if the Knights win, we will contain the source of magic; if the Goraians win, they maintain control over that source (assuming Jill is okay with this idea).  Whatever the case, the battle will be canon since it will take place in the Overworld.  However, what you guys do with the spoils after that is up to you.I foresee the battle progressing on a single thread.  In this thread (if I am the attacker) I will post my formation, troop count, and army composition.  Jill, being the defender, has the advantage of choosing the layout of the area she is defending and goes on to explain her own formation, etc.I will post my actions, Jill posts here, and the mediator determines what happens.  Basically:Jill:  \"The Goraian Cavalry charge the Order's right flank and attempt to engage with the Knight-Brothers.  If the Knight-Brothers attempt to change positions, or avoid contact with the cavalry, then the Goraians will call off the maneuver and return to their position.  The infantry and archers will hold position, but will engage with anyone who comes near.\"Me:  \"The Knight-Brothers charge to meet the Goraian cavalry head on and begin to fight, committing themselves to the attack.  Meanwhile, the 500 Brother Sergeants advance towards the Goraian frontlines and attempt to attack them, using their shields to deflect arrows and their swords to fight the infantry.\"Then the mediator determines the effectiveness of the actions.  He is the one who looks at the unit effectiveness (whose cavalry is better, for example), looks at the numbers, and other factors to determines who is gaining the edge in the cavalry battle.  He then looks at the effectiveness, number, and tactics (as he would need to take into account the Goraian archers firing at us) involved between the infantry that is fighting and explains who is getting an edge in that battle.  Once he explains all of that, we can begin the next turn.EDIT:\u00a0 I was involved in a RP that used this kind of formula.\u00a0 Failure to act accordingly, like not calling off a failed attack,resulted in our soldiers being defeated, routed, or otherwise suffering great casualties.\u00a0 We also used MSPaint to detail formations and tactics.\u00a0 Here is one such picture (we were not aware of Alquen's formation yet):I was the acting commander of that battle and wanted to assume a very defensive position to gauge Alquen's strength (who were unknown to us).", "link_list": ["/user/1110"], "image_list": ["http://i273.photobucket.com/albums/jj222/ande012/InitialPlan.jpg"], "html": "<span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-1110 group-0\" href=\"/user/1110\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@dantessvisconti\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Dantess Visconti</span></a></span>"}, "post-47938": {"user": "Jill", "user_num": 111, "timestamp": "1472406191000", "message": "Dantess, I shall leave this to you.
