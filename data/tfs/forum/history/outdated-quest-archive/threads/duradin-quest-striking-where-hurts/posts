But contrary to its name, the Sea is void of all signs of water, and only miles of red sand greet your gaze. To gain a better view on the land, you traverse slowly up the side of a dune to its peak, only to discover a large settlement of tents and people. Only these people are orcs, with reddened hides and small tusks, their bodies covered in what can only be described as muck. You are immediately spotted, and in Orcish they shout what you believe to be an alarm. Or greeting, as they approach you without any sign of haste. Confidence rolls off the shoulders of each orc that walks towards you, and suddenly a smaller female joins them.The girl seems comically small in comparison to the tall orcs around her, with only her thick dredds poofing up to even the height difference. But despite this, the woman struts with the same amount of oozing confidence and a hint of savagery. In her hand she loosely carries a spear at her side, using it to gesture at you and in broken Common/English she grunts, \u201cOutsider, why you here?\u201dAs you are answering, one of the orcs elbows the girl in the ribs to grab her attention, though she does not wince from the blow. After they exchange a few words in Orcish, the girl returns her orange gaze to you, \u201cWant job? Follow.\u201d Without waiting for your response, the female heads back towards the tents and disappears into the largest one. The other orcs watch you warily as they go back to business, but otherwise ignore your intrusion. It seems you are deemed as no threat to them, and you may choose to accept their job or leave.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<b>Grivnor, the Tribe of Desert Striders, wants you to sabotage the Ragmok Tribe, specifically its leader.</b>"}}
