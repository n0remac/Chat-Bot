The village's main staple is fish and crustaceans, with a few farms providing wheat, tubers, and greens. About 15 families call the village their home, and most of them either work farms or fish. Products that aren't available or grown in town are traded for daily via the merchants that pass through the village.\u00a0 \u00a0Armandol has only two businesses. One is a tavern slash general store, and the other is a smithy. The owner of the store works with villagers and merchants to acquire products via trade. The most work the smithy sees is fixing plows and making fish hooks, though the proprietor is competent and can fix other tools and wares (he is not a weapon/armorsmith).\u00a0 \u00a0There is no inn in the town, but there are large flat areas on either side where travelers and merchants are welcome to set up tents and wagons for the evening.The window for joining in this character-centric quest is 48 hours from now.
