It subsists on grain agriculture, with only one livestock farm within its borders. With a small population of about 50 families between the town center and outlying farms, it is a medium producer, but does enough so that the local lord sends patrols along their main road daily.\u00a0 \u00a0Unfortunately, these patrols haven't been enough to stop several of the townspeople from vanishing. So far three children and two adults are missing in the last week. No signs of struggle or eyewitnesses have been found. The townsfolk are worried that some sort of monster is stealing or devouring their kin, and as no livestock have been lost, it seems like the machinations of intelligent beings.\u00a0 \u00a0The townsfolk have begun plying traveling merchants and patrols for information to find some adventurers to investigate the matter for them. They do not feel safe enough to send one of their own to seek help at the nearby city, and the patrols haven't come back with sheriffs from the lord yet.\u00a0 \u00a0If any adventurers or sellswords are in the area, they will hear from the traveling merchants or guard patrols about the town and its request.\u00a0 \u00a0Game details: I am looking to run this very much like a D&D adventure, where the players are responsible for most of the actions that take place, ie investigations, not starving to death, assassinations, etc. What I have in mind is for \"low level\" characters that will hopefully grow and shape the local world with their maturation (the world will respond to their actions and I will create new content as we go). That being said, if you want to use a younger version of an established character and add it to their lore (if that's allowed), I have no problem with that. Characters could be travelers, mercenaries, or even a brave local that I haven't taken into account.
