You see old Roarin found himself a real bona fide treasure map. Well found on the body of a guy who needs to learn to watch where he is going, I paid 2 gold for that whiskey! Look anyway I'm a Mayor now apparently so I can't go scampering off looking for pirate booty. I am far too busy looking for the other kind of booty! The treasure is somewhere on Carmela Island just waiting to be found so come to\u00a0Vauc'Tutt n' Butts and see me. Wait my secretary says \u00a0I should tell you to come to the house of parliament or whatever, that's dumb meet me at the bar.Lots O' Love.Your Uncle, Mayor Uncle \"Roaring\" Redding Fletcher the Third Esquire.P.S. Don't even think about taking the treasure and running without cutting in your uncle I got the only key to the chest off of the same asshole who doesn't know how to watch where he's going.P.P.S. I don't know what esquire means and I am not the third of anything sounds fancy though right?On an unrelated and out of character note, I am also hoping someone will volunteer to be the Mayors competent secretary who does all the real work in character, though I will still handle all the guests and stuff out of character.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.stack.imgur.com/bYvO3.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/bYvO3.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/>"}, "post-15762": {"user": null, "user_num": null, "timestamp": "1447476117000", "message": "Treasure?
