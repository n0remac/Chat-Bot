It is time, time for me to expand my horizons and I require a gold to be able to do so. One man cannot have political leverage without a vast supply of gold. So, I simply have a very easy task, easy if you are half decent at sneaking, or half decent at killing dragons. Which leads me to my next point.I need a company to assist me to either sneak past the dragon, or dispatch it some way shape of form. I have planned the quest to take place at three hours past midnight, when the dragon will be dormant. Therefore, killing the beast could be simple, if you properly use the environment effectively.It is essential to bring at least three leather sacks full of gold and riches back. These will be split evenly throughout all of the members. Each bag I predict may have at least 2000 gold worth of riches each. This means 6000 in total, to be shared between each-other.Be at the Gemstone Cave at one hour before the quest begins, else-wise there will be consequences.I'll mark the Cave on the map.(post on the thread in open lands to join)", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Ah yes.
