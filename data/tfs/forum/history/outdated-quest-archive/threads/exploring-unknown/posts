{"post-2876": {"user": "Askar", "user_num": 218, "timestamp": "1432248887000", "message": "Exploring the UnknownIC Location -\u00a0Wastes of DrumbarOne way or another you might have stumbled upon a tome, by the looks of it ancient. The cover of the book in a language you possibly didn't quite understand. Upon opening the tome you find that the previous pages had been replaced with translated ones, scribbled in handwriting, the pages lazily fitted to the back of the tome with brown glue. At first it would possibly appear the scribbles of a lunatic.\u00a0The passages were short and hard to piece together, but you understood that the author of the book was rambling about a place, a place of great importance to him.\u00a0Drumbar they called it, translated directly from the ancient language of the Danian tribes of the Northern reaches. I've wanted to visit this place for a while, but as I draw closer to death I fear that it would be forfeit to commit to the journey.\u00a0To whoever finds this - This tome holds knowledge that can not be measured in coin nor the life of man, it must be brought to someone willing to take upon a journey that could quite possibly mean the end, but the chance to write history would entirely be theirs.\u00a0As you make progress it becomes evident that the man is talking about recovering treasure and knowledge from a location in the southern mountains of \"The Wastes of Drumbar\". The area is mapped and described carefully with notes of importance. Furthermore the tome is filled with guidance and help on how to reach the location and\u00a0survive\u00a0there, there is also a bestiary of known creatures that roam the land.\u00a0Askar is the name, Elder Dragon from ages past, his name spread fear\u00a0throughout\u00a0the long gone clans and tribes of Drumbar, but all is not as it appears. I believe this dragon could possibly guard a treasure of some sort, I've mapped the area where I believe the beast could reside, as carefully explained by the scrolls I am translating from.\u00a0Not much information was given on the beast itself, but it is clearly stated not to attempt any sort of interaction with it... I guess that renders my tome pointless..... Anyhow.\u00a0From here on out there is a collection of angry rambles and reflections on the author's work, he even mentions at some point the fact that his hand is cramping up, you probably skipped this part as you skimmed the pages.\u00a0Whoever you are, brave adventurer, I would highly advise that if you do choose to take upon this adventure, bring allies and plenty of them. Carry the tome as well, but be careful, it could quite possibly be old, but I wouldn't know. In these pages is everything you'll need to make it there, but to collect the treasure itself and survive doing it... Well... Good luck I guess?\u00a0At the ending of the tome there are numerous drawings of frogs and flowers, it could quite possibly be so that the author had grown mad.\u00a0OOC InformationI'm available most of the time, so the roleplay could be fast paced if you please, but I am also patient which means anyone can take upon the journey. I'd suggest gathering a group, but if you're a lone wolf that's cool too. I'm not intent fighting whoever takes upon the quest, that is entirely up to how \u00a0the encounter turns out.
