It carries something in its talon, and as you peer up to view it, the object is dropped. You move out of the way, not wanting to be splattered by the bird's leftovers, only to see a scroll unfurl and flutter towards the ground. It lies face up on the dirt, a series of runes (Orcish) scrawled neatly on it.If you have the capability to read Orcish, the runes translate to:\tA thief has struck, stolen our sacred statuette of Movaar the Wise in the night. The coward fled the mountains, out into deserts beyond our borders where we can not follow. We of the Zhura tribe need it returned. May you be of great honor and return our artifact. -Chieftain OrvaBy the time you finish looking at the parchment, the vulture has disappeared, leaving you with a choice; to accept the quest or continue on your way.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<b>Zhura, the Tribe of Shamans, was infiltrated and stolen from and they need you to retrieve the stolen artifact and return it.</b>"}}
