Do you know how to operate forges, work steel, or craft fine swords? Are you a bowyer, or any other sort of profession that has anything at all to do with creating equipment used by warriors and adventurers? \u00a0Would you like to make fabulous sums of gold practicing your craft? Visit the office of Madame Naoki, in The Midnight Sun for more information. \u00a0(Note, if your last name is \"Smith\" or \"Fletcher\" but you have no skills that would be applicable to creating equipment of any sort- this does not mean you.)\u00a0I\u2019m going to fill the as-of-yet unoccupied market of equipment creation in the same way that I filled the market of bars. Sometime in the next week or so, I\u2019m going to create an establishment in Isra, a great big multipurpose forge complex. It\u2019s going to have all sorts of smiths and assorted equipment creators in it, working as a sort of guild, and the topic is going to be a one-stop-shop for anyone who\u2019s looking to get any sort of personal equipment made.\u00a0As such, I\u2019m looking for characters to staff it. Here are some ideas, but I\u2019m really down for any sort of character whose skills are even mildly applicable. Armor and weapon-smiths of all specializations and skill levels,\u00a0bowyers, fletchers,\u00a0enchanters,\u00a0administrative staff to run the place on a daily basis,\u00a0people who make magic staffs and wands, secretaries and attendants to direct customers to the smith that would be best suited for their needs. I intend for this to become a fairly large and prosperous affair, becoming \u2018The Forge\u2019 in the same way that TMS is \u2018The Bar\u2019. I invite anyone who might be interested in being involved to become so. Established characters, new characters, doesn\u2019t really matter. In getting involved, you should expect to do some RP around setting up the forge, interacting with the other characters that end up working there and Naoki, and then doing RP about working there and forging stuff for customers. PM me about it if you\u2019d like, or post questions or whatever here.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><b><font face=\"times new roman\">Now Hiring: Smiths\u00a0</font></b></div>"}, "post-31925": {"user": "Imud Habrua", "user_num": 165, "timestamp": "1459990681000", "message": "Imud would gladly lend his services.
