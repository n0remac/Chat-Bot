What I need is a group of \"adventurers\" for lack of a better word. In my travels, (I say my travels, I suppose it really was my ranger, Vex who did the actual footwork.) I have succeeded in finding something of a lost local legend: The storied Fort of Lortham! Of course, I'd have rolled up my trouser legs and marched right in to rediscover lost glory but it seems Vex was too concerned about \"noises,\" and \"safety\" to be bothered exploring. Some ranger he is, but I digress. What I'm hoping for are maybe three or four adventurers who would be willing to come meet me in my manor, and hash out a plan for reclaiming the fort. Depending on the work that needs to be done, this could potentially be a long-term employment! Imagine, working to rebuild our lost legacy!\u00a0Of course, if you're simply looking to help clear out the fort there are a few \"part-time\" positions available as well. If interested, seek out manor Highwind. (To be created if anyone shows interest in this quest so as not to bog up the location board) We shall discuss your reward there.\u00a0~From the desk of Lord Baxter H.
