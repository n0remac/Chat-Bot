If you are willing to be a part of the Assembly (or the smaller body, the Conclave), and are happy to commit time and writing to us, please contact Empress Naoki and myself in a multi-PM.To expand on what you would be required to do, I would recommend you have a look at the government structure\u00a0here.\u00a0Assembly members will be required to debate on bills and the like occasionally, whenever they are submitted by the Conclave. This position is less intensive and less time-demanding than the other positions on the Conclave, and is much more plentiful.\u00a0Conclave members will be required to adopt one of the portfolios from the list in the government thread. This will entail them running quests in their sphere of influence (as required), as well as deliver a report on the status of said spheres in the Conclave meetings if requested. They will also debate on proposals of bills that will be voted on by the Assembly.\u00a0If anyone is willing to contribute the time, writing, and work effort to be a member, I encourage you to send a PM to Naoki and I.\u00a0", "link_list": ["/user/607", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1591/isra-government"], "image_list": [], "html": "Hello, everyone!"}}
