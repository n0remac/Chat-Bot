There is The Imperial Princess, Skarlet, but she leads a private life and has not been named as the heir. Since The Empire\u2019s foundation, no protocol has been established to determine how the next leader of Isra is to be chosen. Should something untoward happen, a succession crisis would inevitably ensue. Naoki\u2019s strategy thus far has been to not die. This has proven effective, but now, as the years begin to pass and the court begins to make a fuss, she begrudgingly admits that the issue should be addressed.To this end, The Empress has declared that she is now accepting suitors and prospective heirs. Any individual may come before her to present themselves and demonstrate their worth. She has not stated if she intends to select an heir from qualified candidates, adopt a child, birth one herself, or sire a child with those nifty lust magics she has. The game is wide open. Implicitly, she will make a decision based on the options that present themselves. Naoki claims that since her background is none too noble, she feels it fair to present an opportunity to others by meeting with any individual who is serious about the matter. Perhaps the next leader of Isra is out there shining shoes, tilling fields, or working some other... unsophisticated profession. The reality is that she selected this method to artificially elongate the process and postpone the decision, but she will be seeing visitors regardless. Interested individuals should visit The Citadel.Following this announcement, some began to murmur. Once upon a time, Isra was democratic. The Empress was elected as Lady of The Free City. From there, she pushed an expansionist agenda and assumed her title. Now, she is so presumptuous as to appoint her own heir? Some individuals have expressed concern that Isra has been perverted from the free, democratic state it was founded as. Hereditary transfer of power was most certainly not what the city\u2019s founders intended. However, without someone to champion this cause, it will result in nothing more than grumbling.Note that participation in this RP won\u2019t necessarily translate into OOC responsibilities.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "It\u2019s a well-known and often whispered about fact throughout The Empire: The Empress is without an apparent heir.
