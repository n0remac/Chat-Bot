The quest is to retrieve for her a meteorite suspected to lie within the Eastern Forest. She states that she will pay five times its weight in gold to whoever brings it to her, as well as \u201cFavors.\u201d Compasses pointing toward the prize are available in the Central Plaza to any who decide to undertake this quest. OOC: The quest supports any number of characters on forays into the forest. Having many characters competing would be ideal. Characters may be harmed but most likely not killed. This quest is the first of what I hope will be a large, unfolding story.
