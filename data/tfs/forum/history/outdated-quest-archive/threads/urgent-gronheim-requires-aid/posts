Each one of them would say the exact same thing:\"Dear Reader,These letters are being sent out by the Elders of Gronheim, a small town in isolated in a thick forest in lands where no government rules. During the past several weeks, our town has come under attack from a rapidly growing army of animals, monsters and beasts who seem to be under a spell of nefarious manipulation that directs them towards our walls. Many of us have fought and fallen bravely, but we are now left with no other choice but to officially ask for aid from prospecting adventurers of all kinds.\u00a0This contract will be dangerous and may well lead to your death, but we will be able to reward the successful completion of it and the defence of our town with valuable trinkets of magical nature and gold to spend how you will. At this current rate, we will not last another week from the date of sending these letters, so we beg that all who can help us ride here with the utmost haste!Only a single road leads through our forest, with our town built on it. This is the road you must take to get here, but beware that we no longer have the manpower to keep it consistently patrolled. Reaching Gronheim will be dangerous, so we recommend you come prepared, but once you are here we will spare you whatever aid we can.Please help,Gronheim.\"Attached to the bottom of the flyer is a map showing the location of the forest, as well as the road that leads through it and the town of Gronheim itself. (link)---------------------------OOC information:1) This will be a relatively open-ended quest. There is an overarching plotline that I will be trying to tell, but ultimately there will be a great deal of freedom in how you approach any situation that could ultimately change that story to a significant degree. To compensate for this, I will be striving to play both the 'allies' and the 'villains' realistically and in an equally adaptable and persistent manner.\u00a02) This quest is suited primarily for entry-level and low-powered characters. There will be opportunities to gain experience and strength in the course of the quest in whatever ways you may desire, but \"high powered\" characters who could immediately destroy all enemies, or someone leading a large and well-trained pre-established military force will likely not fit in and ultimately ruin the point and the fun of this RP. While I cannot and won't stop you from doing these things on account of this being a fantasy sandbox, I do hope you take these words into account and try not to ruin it for others. \u00a03) Please post here if you plan to have your character accept the request. It helps me keep track of everything. =)", "link_list": [""], "image_list": [], "html": "In busy taverns, gathering places and towns all across the overworld, birds would drop off flyers and notices to be pinned upon notice boards.
