I'm looking for some characters to fill in the high ranking positions, in order to make some more interesting roleplay within Isra. These higher ranks are known as the 'lords of flame' and carry near complete control over the Assembly; however decisions they make have to coincide with the other lords. These ranks however are underneath Attla, and still have to follow his commands.1.Bryn Fereldem [Basic Overview]Bryn is a young, aspiring, ruthless pyromancer, enthralled by the idea of power. His newfound rank motivates him to gain a rivalry with Attla, wishing to kill him in order to inherit his position. He has a deep resentment of authority, hating the idea of being ordered around. He is cruel to his underlings, giving draconic punishments for small errors; he frequently kills those who do not succeed in missions.He is extremely powerful in the art of pyromancy, utilising brute force in order to combat his foes. He frequently utilises underhanded tactics, such as superheating air in order to suffocate his foes, transmuting ground into lava, etc. etc.. He is a very formidable foe, as he can utilise such tactics in order to combat anti-magic. He is not to be underestimated.He stands at 5'10, and of an average, slightly slim build. He is predominately found wearing a full-cloak, often shrouding his features. (Character below. Might want to use it for faceclaim)Might add more characters soon. I do hope to gain more characters in the Assembly naturally, therefore I will wait.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://orig06.deviantart.net/e74e/f/2014/079/f/5/fire_mage___speed_painting_by_tristanberndtart-d7ay3bs.jpg"], "html": "The Inferno Assembly is pretty lonely.
