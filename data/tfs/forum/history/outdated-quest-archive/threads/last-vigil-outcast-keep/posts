With little enough to do between the last day of market and the first fall of snow many laborers took to spending what little spare coin they had on warm beer, warmer company, and a warmer fire. Of course, the end of the year had meant the end of the year festivities and there were still travelers taking lodging in the inn, these folk made the night that much more lively with stories of adventures and far off places when they could be coaxed into it with liberal lashings of libations. With such a pleasant night it was perhaps providence that leads to it being disrupted. The doors to the outside world were flung wide, the first chill winter wind accompanying their opening as the hooded figure strode in. Their entrance was a clear demand for the attention of those gathered compounded by the steady determined gait of their stride as they approached the center of the room. With all eyes on them, they pull back their hood revealing the delicate, yet slightly blunted, features of a half-elf. \"My name.\" She begins, her voice lilting almost lyrical yet cut with the crisp clear lines of military discipline. \"Is Saria Fairwater, Ranger Captain of Outcast Keep.\" A pause as she draws in a breath and swallows her pride. \"I come to beg aid of any with the strength of arms to lift a sword. We are under siege and without succor from mercenary forces we fear that we shall fall. We offer fair coin to any willing to pick up arms in our defense.\"For those interested in joining the excursion please post below. I intend for this to be a power level light quest, so no characters that could theoretically break a siege single-handedly. I want to run this semi-realistically, albeit on an accelerated schedule since a regular siege would involve more waiting than I think anyone would enjoy. I'd like to keep the number of people involved relatively small, but if I have enough interested parties perhaps we can split into groups for people helping inside and outside the walls. I look forward to writing with you.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i-h1.pinimg.com/564x/ae/1f/ce/ae1fceb476b7894629fcddb4f4a6fe5d.jpg", "https://i-h1.pinimg.com/564x/ae/4a/ec/ae4aec6e1f5081969ee8f0e32c8c6f7f.jpg"], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><b><u><font size=\"6\">The Last Vigil of Outcast Keep</font></u></b></div>"}, "post-88823": {"user": "Alliandre Saleia", "user_num": 1597, "timestamp": "1548213558000", "message": "Alliandre Saleia would like to help defend Vigil Keep!", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Alliandre Saleia would like to help defend Vigil Keep!"}, "post-88827": {"user": "Skylark", "user_num": 3342, "timestamp": "1548251348000", "message": "Skylark would help to defend the keep!", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Skylark would help to defend the keep!"}, "post-88848": {"user": "Storyteller", "user_num": 3343, "timestamp": "1548301871000", "message": "Skylark, Alliandre Saleia I will tag you in the thread once it starts, I am going to give it just a bit more time for interested parties to jump in before I get things underway.", "link_list": ["/user/3342", "/user/1597"], "image_list": [], "html": "<span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-3342 group-0\" href=\"/user/3342\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@skylark\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Skylark</span></a></span>"}, "post-88867": {"user": "Treva Briarheart", "user_num": 1168, "timestamp": "1548383436000", "message": "Treva Briarheart will assist in the defense of those championing protection of the innocent!", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Treva Briarheart will assist in the defense of those championing protection of the innocent!"}, "post-88874": {"user": "Kehy", "user_num": 3344, "timestamp": "1548393653000", "message": "The traveler Kehy puzzles out the words, before nodding.
