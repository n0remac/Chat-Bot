Jun of the Celadine  , Sun Marshal, and Daedalus  , The Minister of Magic. Jun's name is known to some as a hero of significant renown. She's taken part in many noble ventures and has saved thousands upon thousands of lives \u2014 some, multiple times over. Notably, she played a major role in containing the undead outbreak in Aaedan, took part in repelling at least four giant monsters that were attacking The Empire, and everyone remembers that one time when she was fighting that dragon in the Central Plaza and teleported without her clothes. Comparatively, not much is known about Daedalus \u2014 other than he's supposedly quite strong. They say that he's mastered all forms of magic, but that must surely be an exaggeration. Whatever the case may be, he'll surely have his mettle tested in the upcoming match, set to take place soon.(Note: The match will start when it's ready. \"This weekend\" would be nice, that's my goal, but I'm not holding to that as a deadline.)The match will take place in The Oculus Solis Arena, in a fight thread. Spectators will sit in the seating area.
