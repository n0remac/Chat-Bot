Please have this note!\" The notes says:\"Dear adventurer or which name will best describe your profession. I am a collector and historian from Jeoncho, the mainland of Tawakoshi. I have recently come into possession of a magnificent old artifact, which used belong to the young empress of Tawakoshi 800 years ago. It is a true masterwork to such an extent that words will not properly describe it. I shall never the less try so you may understand why I seek your help. The item is a glass dragon forged made from hundreds of small joints and bits like a doll, which makes it move almost seamlessly. It is of course a priceless item, but I believe this item holds a secret which is much more valuable than the item itself. I am, however, not in my prime age anymore and cannot venture out on such a mission myself. Therefore I implore you come to Jeoncho, and I will be willing to reward you well, though I suspect what treasures you might find on the way will be of far higher value. Yours,Uchino Soke\"_________________________________________________About the RP:This will be a relatively expansive story and it holds a lot of content, rare items, story and lore. You will by no means have to be a Tawakoshi expert, but a little interest in this foreign land will definitely help. This RP will cater three to four people and start the second week of january. Please ask away if you have any questions and let me know if you want to join. Foreigners are encouraged to join!

She opened the letter and read the words and as soon as she saw the Glass Dragon mentioned inside of it she gasped. She dropped her broom and immediately ran around the shrine, placed a key inside the door that was there and walking into a small room that was hidden there. She lit a candle and started to look through the books that were located there until she found the one she was looking for and opened it on a page. Right there on the page was the picture of the exact glass dragon that was described in the letter. With the hundreds if not thousands of joints that could move separately. The words in the book were in a language and hand that Ayame herself had never been able to read, but she knew that the collection of books had been in her family for generation after generation. After all her family had been the protectors of this shrine for generation after generation. She carefully closed the book again and started to wrap it in bundles of paper and cloth, making sure it was well protected from anything that could hurt it before she even dared to take it outside the room. She locked it again with her key as she stepped into the sunlight, tugging the package close to her chest. What she was about to do was unheard of. She was going to leave the shrine and even take one of its holy artifacts with her. Before she dared to ascend the stairs she turned around and bowed as deep as she could towards the shrine. \"Please forgive me Kami-sama! This is something I must do!\" then she turned around and descended to make her way towards Jeoncho.
