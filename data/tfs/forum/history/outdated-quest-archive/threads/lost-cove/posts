Thus it may come as little surprise that a new tale, charged with all the history and tantalizing secrets that curious gossip offers, would begin to surface around the fringes of the local tavern talk... It was not likely to be headline news, but in due time, any experienced tavern-goer might hear of it from the shadows of dark corners and stormy nights as the tale slowly grew credibility from the grassroots.\u00a0 \u00a0 As the legend goes, an ancient dark wizard, Reksath, and his two accomplices, wreaked havoc on a small, local kingdom, the ruins of which can still be found.
