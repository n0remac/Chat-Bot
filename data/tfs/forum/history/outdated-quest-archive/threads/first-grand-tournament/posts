{"post-6563": {"user": null, "user_num": null, "timestamp": "1439771574000", "message": "Many years ago, before the cataclysm tore the old world asunder, a grand tournament was held once a year calling together warriors from all corners of the known world to compete in glorious combat. The greatest nations put forward their most skilled and revered fighters to battle for honor and glory on the grandest stage of them all. This tradition, along with many lives and nations, fell to darkness during the cataclysm. Now, the Kingdom of Perimoore once again invites all warriors to the First Grand Tournament of the new world in an attempt to rekindle the relations between the nations of this rebuilding world.Hopefully this is going to be the first, big, collaborative event between all factions of the site. Essentially this is going to be a one on one PVP tournament where characters can fight without the risk of death or injury but still for the glory of the faction they are representing. To sign up simply reply below with the character you wish to sign up with and the faction they are choosing to represent. Once everyone who wants to sign up has done so I will post an official ladder showing who will be fighting who and the road to victory.\u00a0For setting the Tournament will be held in the Capital of the Kingdom of Perimoore; Perimoore city in a purpose built coliseum. The ground on which the combatants will fight upon is hewn from one giant piece of Bowestone and enchanted by the most senior Mages Guild artificers to essentially make it one of the largest Magicka in the history of the Kingdom of Perimoore. This Magicka has been dubbed the Duel-Stone as it protects those standing on it from any life threatening injuries by teleporting them away a short distance to safety while also nullifying most other magics. As such the individuals are safe from death and major injuries while also being unable to use Magic. The winner of the tournament will be awarded a large sum of gold and will gain a large amount of fame within Perimoore as well as being known as the champion of the known world. The faction they are representing will also be responsible for hosting the next Grand Tournament the following year.The RulesCan't die or get serious injuries (Will be teleported out of the Arena upon taking a serious or lethal blow)No magic (Sorry mages but this is to make it a little simpler to start with. Future Tournaments may include magic but for now i've decided to keep it simple.)10 Posts a round per combatant/Final fight is 20 each (Matches may be called by the judges before the time limit or may be conceded by either combatant if they feel they are losing bad enough)Can represent a faction, it is encouraged but free agents may participate too. If a free agent wins the highest placing representing combatant will win the honour of their government/faction/group hosting the next tournament.\u00a0More then one participant can represent a faction allowing any and all combatants to join if they so wish.There will be three judges each scoring out of 50 when the combat ends for a total score of 150 for each participant. The outcome of the combat, specifically the effectiveness and realism of your actions will be given the most consideration with participants receiving negative modifiers for any unrealistic actions.Participants must wear the supplied\u00a0Armour Set\u00a0which is made of leather and is more symbolic then practical. Besides who needs armour when your not taking any real harm, it is designed to promote fast and skillful sword play between combatants.\u00a0All weapons, abilities, skills and powers need to be explained before the tournament start and not changed during the tournament. \u00a0The Winner will receive Perimoore Gold and Fame (to be spent in the store) and the nation they represent is charged with hosting the next Grand Tournament\u00a0Okay ladies so lets get this going! Our first attempt at a whole site encompassing event. Hopefully, if this goes well and people enjoy the event we can make it a repeated event as stated above.ParticipantsAbby Rookborne - PerimooreStrike Fist - The Phoenix State\u00a0Max - The Free CityIsao - KatashimaInquisitor Iona Varithim - IveliusJill -\u00a0 Durasus TribeFenris - Medan Firgov Estherol - The Phoenix StateNyx - Aaedan Optio-Legate Ozmidas - Aaedan\u00a0", "link_list": ["http://img12.deviantart.net/40e8/i/2014/031/2/1/warrior_rogue_leather_armor_by_azmal-d74i4a2.jpg"], "image_list": ["http://i.picresize.com/images/2015/08/16/H16DV.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://i.picresize.com/images/2015/08/16/H16DV.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/></div>"}, "post-6611": {"user": null, "user_num": null, "timestamp": "1439842187000", "message": "Abby Rookborne, Representating Perimoore", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Abby Rookborne, Representating Perimoore"}, "post-6626": {"user": "Strike-Fist", "user_num": 515, "timestamp": "1439863702000", "message": "Strike-Fist, representing The Phoenix State.On a side note, I am presuming that weapons are allowed, since there was no rule against them.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Strike-Fist, representing The Phoenix State."}, "post-6719": {"user": null, "user_num": null, "timestamp": "1440026105000", "message": "Edited rules and participants.
