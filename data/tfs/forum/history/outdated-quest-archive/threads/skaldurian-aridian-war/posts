Each has wildly different views as to what this war means and are intent on accomplishing their goals. Will you take a side in the coming conflict and if so, who will be your allies?The Side of \u00cdskaldur\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the coming days you may see or hear of an army passing through the lands, coming from the North to the deserts of Arida, the warriors' faces hardened and ready for war. While a majority of their ranks consist of burly and battle hardened warriors, a good portion of it is also made up of lumbering beings of crystal who stand about 7 foot tall and are nearly as wide, and floating above them in extremely small numbers are what could only be described as angels entirely covered in armor, wielding long pikes or lances.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If one were to approach this army and ask their business, they'd quickly be directed to the front where the mighty Thrand Rangvaldrson   led. If you continued to ask questions he'd explain quite clearly that the honorless desert people had attacked their emissary without provocation, and in doing so had made it clear that they were no friend and invited such retaliation with open arms. He'd also make it very clear that this army had no intention on invading anywhere else, it's only motive at the moment to conquer the City State who had spat on \u00cdskaldur's name. An invitation to join to those who appeared as worthy allies and for those who did not appear the type it wouldn't be hard to convince him, and negotiations of a reward could be discussed afterwards, depending on your performance in the upcoming battles. However it'd be made very clearly that you'd be rewarded no small sum if you do choose to participate. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To meet the \u00cdskaldurians and join their side, post in this thread In Character as the army of \u00cdskaldur will be constantly on the move and not in any one location for very long. The Side of Aridia\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These sands have been soaked in the blood of our people. This land, our land, our fathers, land is now under siege. \u00cdskaldur, their hearts of ice and darkness, have come. They have come proclaiming us unworthy, lesser. Not deserving of the sands that our fathers, and our father's fathers, and our father's father's fathers are buried beneath. We wished for nothing peace and trade with the outside world beyond. Now this enemy has to come to take our home, remove our place in the world. We shall not yield to them, nor any who would dare bring war to our people. The All Mother has blessed us with riches. Riches that we will see go to any friend who would fight with us. Those who seek alliance, friendship, and wealth, come to me. I would see your skills, no matter how small, put to use. The desert awaits.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To meet with the Aridians and join their team, first travel to the Aridian DesertOOC: \u00cdskaldur and Aridia sections authored by the respective players of \u00cdskaldur   and Arridia  .The war is scheduled to start this Thursday at 8:00 Pacific Time.
