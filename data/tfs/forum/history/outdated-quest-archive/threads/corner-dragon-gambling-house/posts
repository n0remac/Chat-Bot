You probably won't see this place in the tourist charter, but asking the locals where the best gambling hall in town is, you'll quickly get the right idea of where to go. Just don't ask the officials...\u00a0The Corner Dragon is a place for gamblers, and you'll be able to enjoy the thrill of winning (or losing) here, as you put you hard earned coins on the line and hopefully leave a richer guy or girl!\u00a0But the Corner Dragon is not just about gambling money, as they have a vast stock of previously pawned items. These items may sometimes be very rare, magical or lead you on quests to explore the faraway country of Tawakoshi! Only prerequisite is that you'll have to put one of your own rare items on the line to win one!Also The Corner Dragon has a wide selection of clientele and you may strike up conversation with many different people who share the same passion for seeing the dices make their fortune. Who knows? Even if you aren't very lucky at the table, some stranger might point you in the way of even greater riches or pay you to help them out of their trouble! You just never know!\u00a0The Corner Dragon might not be very large, flashy or luxurious but it will surely provide you with a memorable evening. And who knows, strangers may become friends who\u00a0lead you somewhere you had never expected to explore the mysterious land of Tawakoshi!So go visit the fabled Corner Dragon Gambling House\u00a0and indulge in the gambling!----------------------OOC notes:Anyone can participate in the gambling of either items or money, but if you wish for it to contain a quest, please let me know beforehand! Also I'd be happy to facilitate quests to explore Tawakoshi through The Corner Dragon, even if your character hasn't got any rare items to gamble with. Also note: Beware what items you gamble with as they become the property of The Corner Dragon when lost and cannot be won or bought back! Instead some other RP'er may be lucky enough to win it!", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/2934/corner-dragon-cho-gambling-house?page=1&scrollTo=76001", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/2934/corner-dragon-cho-gambling-house?page=1&scrollTo=76001"], "image_list": [], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><font face=\"trebuchet ms\"><font size=\"6\"><a href=\"http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/2934/corner-dragon-cho-gambling-house?page=1&amp;scrollTo=76001\" rel=\"norewrite\" target=\"_blank\">--- The Corner Dragon ---<br><br/></br></a></font><br/></font><div style=\"text-align:left;\"><font face=\"trebuchet ms\">This is the name of a small gambling house located in the city of Kiyonai in the province of Tawakoshi.
