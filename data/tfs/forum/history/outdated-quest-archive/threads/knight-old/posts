A story that brings tears to his eyes and anger to his heart. He left nothing but a humble squire and has returned as an elite warrior of many skills and trades. But upon his return he found his homeland destroyed by poverty and crime. Everywhere he looks it is nothing but sadness and hate, anger and regret, towns burned down and castles falling apart. He has vowed to help restore his home to its former glory, to the Kingdom it used to be whether he is in charge or another. He is a warrior, a mercenary, a man who can train the strongest army in the world, an army that will never tire, an army who can pick up a weapon and use it, an army that will fight till they win or die. One problem is he has no money to begin rebuilding, to hire help, to grow this land to be as prosperous as it used to be and he has no place to live. He must first find work as the hired sword the sword he loves so much. Times have changed to the point of not being recognized by this Knight. He will now walk through the world he once knew and try to find his way.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Having returned from the war, the war that only be described by the blood stains on his tunic and nicks in his sword.
