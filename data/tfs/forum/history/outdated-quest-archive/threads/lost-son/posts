There was a landslide near Doobie's home that damaged the house, luckily the other 2 children are safe. During the landslide, little Wah was carried away on a large flat rock, seeming protected from falling rocks. It is unknown where he is now. The rock that he was on seems to have drifted further than the rest of the land, much much further, unnaturally. Doobie searches for his son, but must also take care of his other two children, so he can't wander far. He has sent for help in finding Wah Doobie , hoping that someone can find him if word gets out that he's missing.-Respond to this if you want to encounter Wah Doobie  and will help him find his way home-Wah Doobie is a little Kobold child that wears feathers on his head, he has a fascination with rocks and has supernatural talent that he isn't aware of, not even his father has seen it yet. He seems slow in the head, but he's actually really knowledgeable about things like rocks (He has Autism Spectrum Disorder).
