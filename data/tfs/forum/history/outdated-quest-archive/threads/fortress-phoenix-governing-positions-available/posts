This fortress-city was built in recognition of the agreements between the lands. From this place, The Phoenix State would do as they promised.

Unlike other cities, they decided to offer the full array of sciences they specialized in such as Medical, Magical, Gaia, and Religious. This in turned offered a Hospital, Entertainment, Philosophers, and of course, a small Cathedral.\u00a0The second thing it would be known for is it's military program. It is the first attempt to offer outside people to join their military force. With so many people here, especially the young, who are looking for adventure, they thought they could pull some loyal people.\u00a0The Phoenix State made sure to cover every aspect of their side of the agreement. In turn, they had one of the most beautiful places in the east. All the two governing bodies could do was hope that this place could do was ensure peace remained and that this fort never fell.
