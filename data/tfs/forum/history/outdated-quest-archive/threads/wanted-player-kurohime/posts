Last time we met Yu, he was locked in a quest, which will never see completion, for the player in charge has decided to not continue it any further.In the quest, Yu encountered and was enchanted by a Spider-Woman hybrid by the name of Kurohime. The thread in question can be found here. The foundation seemed interesting to say the least, and I would like to explore their character dynamics further. Thing is, I want someone to fill the role of Kurohime. Specifically, I want YOU.Basically, you can have control of what sort of character you want her to be including looks, background, motivations, etc. If you  are interested, we can discuss the specifics of their relationship in PMs, if you so desire.If you find this appealing, please drop a comment below.
