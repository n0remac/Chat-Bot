Some stories claim that a natural disaster destroyed much of the city, and the survivors fled. Some say that the people of Lhesa fell to decadence and sin, and their undoing came at the hands of barbarian invaders, or the vengeful hand of their own angry gods.Now, a map has been found, claiming to show the location of the fabled city. An undisclosed financier is putting together an expedition to follow the map and find the city. Untold dangers and incredible treasures await those daring enough to take up the quest! Set sail from Rondon, and write your name in the history books...OOC: This is intended to be a pulp-style action-adventure for a small group of explorers and treasure-hunters in the vein of Queen of the Black Coast, Congo, and Temple of Doom. Looking for 3-5 interested players.- Players are expected to keep a reasonable posting rate. A general speed of 1-2 posts per day is fine, missing a day here and there is fine, I\u2019m not a stickler.- Extremely powerful characters will not enjoy this, and neither would the people going with them. If your character has nothing to fear from poison darts, falling rocks, bottomless pits, venomous animals, sharpened sticks, and other such hazards, maybe this isn\u2019t the quest for you.- Extremely weak characters that will constantly need to be rescued from such hazards will need to have some sort of relevant skill to explain why anyone would bring you along.Apply in the thread below. The quest will begin as soon as a reasonable team has been put together.
