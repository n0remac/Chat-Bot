You will be crossing the sea and entering a foreign land that we only know exist because of this specific map. One will encounter swamps, mountains, and caves. The dangers that lurk are unknown, but with it being a relic, you should expect a challenge. You will be escorted by Vengelixo Novarick, as he was the being that came to us with this knowledge. We know little of him, but he has proven to be a very loyal being who will lie his life on the line to save another.May your swords be sharper and your mind be sharper. \u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The Angelic Order of Atlanticus is looking for brave warriors and intelligent strategists to hunt for an ancient \u00a0relic known as the Relic of the Moon.
