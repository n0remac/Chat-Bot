I'm new, so not entirely sure how this works XDEssentially it's a \"passive\" quest (if that makes sense), there's no real DM or GM. To \"undergo\" or \"try\" this quest, first you'd have to do as the poster describes: \"If yah are interested, pick this letter up and head unto the forest thickets and hold this above ye head, we'll know not to kill and can bargain or discuss more.\" Then, (assuming you said yes and met with whoever to \"accept\" the quest) you'd have to find the target (Xin) in the IC game world (The Overworld) and obviously, as the poster says, try and take him in alive (or dead, but alive is preferred) and get your money/reward. However, if you're new I wouldn't particularly recommend trying PVP so early (unless you already kinda know what you're doing, and are willing to accept any consequences of your actions.) I hope I explained it well enough, sorry if I didn't.Feel free to shoot me a PM at Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui for any questions, big or small.
