So as fey tradition there will be a huge party to celebrate the coming of the winter season!Now, winter parties may not be the most rowdy, but there is drinking and dancing galore. So, this is your invitation to join the winter fey in merriment! This will most likely be a week long event, so even if you can't get to it on the first day, there's six others to cause some raucous.\u00a0This quest/announcement is to mostly encourage people to make some fey characters or learn a little more about what's going on in Titania. So I would prefer fey characters to attend the event, but if humans or any non-fey were to show up it would cause some beautiful drama that we all love.I am open to suggestions on music that will be played, what week we all wish to do this, and where the drama that happens at the even will carry on to.But note that after this even is done. Cirno and not Riva will be in charge of the fey realm.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://api.ning.com/files/kV4MbYiv7oQglQ24od6QEovjHrlo6G4CW9fReIGGiDsUAy0-ilqxtqpaDv8dM-i*N3LTqJnOfH-HArmtzWCJHtm5CAxZ4-Te/1082018484.jpeg"], "html": "Now, as most of us know the seasons are being to change and it's getting very close to winter now.
