Romeo has one passion in life: Ladies. Tall ladies, short ladies, fat ladies, slender ladies, human ladies, non-human ladies. All in all he seems to have no restriction in his love and admiration for the gentle sex. He loves to travel and when he meets a lady who seems lost and lonely, he will always try to encourage her day by doing something romantic for her. A box of chocolate, a bouquet of flowers, a romantic poem or a love song. A serenade in the full moon under the lady's bedroom window. He would court her in the old-fashioned way, for as long as she wishes.Are there any lonely ladies out there who needs a valiant Knight in shining armor (or at least that's what he thinks himself to be) and who sees it as his personal task in life to make sure no woman in this world has to feel unloved or unwanted? Feel free to offer your characters here, and I will send Romeo your way!", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["//storage.proboards.com/6046952/images/5AgYdAfn8rATue75bHkc.png"], "html": "Hi guys - or should I rather say Ladies  "}}
