It hadn't take him long to find the church and he had enjoyed the long walk through the sombre forrest along the way. It wasn't until he had reached the designated meeting spot that he began to feel a little on edge. Foxko was fairly sure this wasn't some elaborate trap to get him here alone but he couldn't help but feel a little vulnerable at the word of \u00a0the Vampire Lord.Now that he had spotted the wagon approaching with other adventures he felt a bit more at ease. The undead drawing the cart on the other hand gave him a slight chill. He never could get used to seeing the dead walk, even if they did so on four legs.He watched the others as they exited the carriage and was impressed at the unique appearance of the bunch. He was also impressed to see Lord Volquin offer his assistance in their descent from the carriage. Clearly he had been wrong about the man.As Foxko made his way over to the the others he started to feel the ground bellow him begin to rattle, as if the worms themselves were against him being there. This thought came to an end as he stared to watch undead rise from the graves in front of him.\" Well this is all very exciting\" he said to nobody in particular. He waited for the Lord to finish his spell and gawked as the rings were handed out and even more so as Volquin transformed in front of them \"This really IS exciting\" he now thought to himself ", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Foxko sat at his hiding spot, a safe distance from the church where he had been directed to wait after his meeting with Lord Volquin earlier.

The scenery had certainly changed, taking a turn for the worse. He decided not to comment upon it. The morbidity of it all struck fear into his heart, despite him being steeled to such climates beforehand. He disliked such places. It always drove him on edge.\u00a0What was he doing with those graves? Necromancy? Seemed as if he were.He admired the level of necromancy the vampire practised. He counted a good three dozen figures pulling themselves from inside the graves. Only an experienced necromancer could perform such a spell, he reckoned. Querying about such trivialities would waste term, so he decided to not push the topic any further. He turned towards Igrik instead, noticing he had joined him outside of the carriage.His eyes moved down towards Igrik's suitcase. Why would he bring such a container to this place? He believed Igrik not to be a fool. Perhaps it is some cunning guise for something far more sinister. He decided upon the latter.\u00a0The plan was interesting, but nothing out of the ordinary. Nothing particularly special expected of him, making his job far easier. Paladin's are simple folk, and considering Attla's living form, would make the majority of their spells ineffective against him. Of course, he didn't aim to provoke any of them in combat. He reasoned he should be able to sneak past them, to some degree. The only obstacle was his allies. If they were not the sneaking sort, his plan would have to change.As the vampire finished, he gladly accepted the ring. It would come in handy. Perhaps he could keep it afterwards? That would be a valuable asset. He placed it upon his grimy ring finger, on his left hand. Placing it upon his right hand would impede spell-casting. He would wish to avoid that.\"Nothing from me.
