It is frequented by pirates and merchants alike, often as a refuge from the harsh tropical storms. It's said that the lagoon was formed when a massive meteor struck the island, carving out an enormous crater that then filled with water. Regardless of whether or not this is true, explorers of the island have found that they see an unusually high number of shooting stars over the island. Several have actually reported seeing meteors fall on the island or into the surrounding waters, some of which have been recovered. It's an unusual phenomenon, and has not yet been explained. Still, it's not unusual at all to find bits of stone or metal that have fallen from the sky on or around Starfall Cove.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/kUecdFq.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kUecdFq.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/></div>"}, "post-62855": {"user": null, "user_num": null, "timestamp": "1492101169000", "message": "After a day of sailing on her small dhow, she arrived to Starfall Cove with a large treasure chest.
