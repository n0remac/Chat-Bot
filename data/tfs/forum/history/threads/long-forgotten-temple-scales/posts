A dagger at her back was for cutting herbs and their roots.Poison powders rested in her ring and necklace. They were her strongest bet, but how many attackers would obey if asked to put something into their mouth?This was a bad idea.

Her full lips were smooth and even toned. Her face had never been broken and hardly ever stretched. Not a pox scar was upon it. A proud neck held it up with dignity. Well, when the clock clasp wasn't dragging back and choking her. She cleared her throat politely as she reached long fingers upwards to pull it back down.His face, however, did not hold the beauty her's had. It was marked with experience and mauled with regret.

Instead of her usual flaunting, she pulled the cloak back closed. The fire and their breathing (along with their heartbeats that only he could hear) were the only sounds within room. Not even a rat squeaked and the wolf howls sound much farther away than they had before. She looked to the ground near the fire, taking several glances in his direction to see if he had shifted in a stance to strike. The way the light flickered across his face made him seem so old. What was there to fear from an aged man?He asked her a question. \"Do gentlemen assassins not procure a place for a lady to sit?\" Her tone was snappy, but she was smiling ruefully down at home. Osma waited until he had cleared out a spot as best he could and covered it with a folded up bit of dry cloth about three feet in front of the fire and catty corner to his spot near the wall. She was delighted to learn that it was far easier to move about in her false peasant clothes than it was in the usual, tight gowns she wore. For a moment, her form was once more exposed as she threw her arm out to flick the end of the cloak at from under her and sat down. The cloak made a funnel up to her shoulders. \"I was misdirected in Irsa. No doubt on  purpose . I had just visited a local inn and tavern. My very first time being in one publically owned. They were not...\" She inhaled as her blush came to her cheeks. Her chin coyly turned away. There was no way she was going to tell him about the bartender who made her think he had given her human breast milk to cool her mouth. \"...friendly and they have the most horrible drinks! If you ever go to the Midnight Sun never drink the Dragon's Roar and do not believe what they tell you about the milk they give you to take out the burn.\" And that's all she would say on the matter. Most likely. Oh wait, nope. She wasn't done.\"I mean, it would be a complete health violation if they actually served breastmilk! If health violations have been invented yet, that is. I just don't see what is so damned funny about tricking people that way! I did nothing to that....that...punk! Pardon my curse word, if you please.\" She paused for half a second. Just long enough for someone else to get ready to speak and then for her to mow right over them. \"I don't know why everyone keeps laughing at me. People outside of Gaiman are so mean. Even you laughed at me.\" She glared at him. ", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"A gentlemen assassin.\" She summed up, cause that made a WORLD of sense.

Her dark eyes stabbed at him like daggers and her full lips remained pursed in a defiant pout.  Ruin's chest tightened and his arms began to tense as the familiarity of this look crept into his mind.
