The Golden Lotus stands large and proud, usually bustling with all sorts of visitors at most hours. Friendly older individuals come in for tea during the morning and many hard workers unwind in the evening, with a busy blend of both throughout the day. The establishment has a number of sitting rooms with several tables and many sitting cushions each. Some rooms are bigger with a slightly elevated stage for entertainment, and there are even tables set up along the veranda halls on the side of the building - overlooking the Ishiwata lake.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/n4ATjHu.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/n4ATjHu.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}, "post-62235": {"user": "Ronin", "user_num": 2173, "timestamp": "1490919841000", "message": "The first stop Ronin would make in the city was the Golden Lotus, a sort of retreat.  Since entering the city the ronin tucked his daisho into his obi, and then folded the kimono over them so to hide them.  He did not want anyone to think he was here to cause trouble.  His travel papers were tucked into his obi as well; he did not want to lose them, and they would certainly prove useful in the future.Ronin gave a short glance around to see who in all was in the room.  He minded his business and sat down at an empty table.  Perhaps one of the servers would bring him something to drink or eat.  He had enough coin on him to last a few days as long as he conserved it.Until a servant approached him Ronin tuned his ears to listen out for any rumors or remarks.(@xiangyuan)", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The first stop Ronin would make in the city was the Golden Lotus, a sort of retreat.

What a handsome man. For the moment, there wasn't too much in loud chatter - gossip was little to be had for the time being.
