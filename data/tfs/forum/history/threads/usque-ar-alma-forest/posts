I know you've not seen me in many years.\"The scene grew to be like something from a beautiful movie. The woods themselves seemed to respond to Camilla's presence. Saplings seemed to perk up and unfurl a few leaves in welcome, the grass seemed greener, the party might feel as if there were eyes upon them, whispers heard all around them... She stood, then, and turned in a small circle. A soft glow seemed to surround the princess for a moment and she seemed... well.. like someone else almost. Her face shifted before their eyes briefly, into that of a similar but older face with blazing green eyes.Her head tilted back and she jerked a little bit. Someone else's voice found her lips. It was a deep, but not raspy like Camilla's, voice. \"The time has come to right the wrongs of old. Venture through these woods with the blessings of all the creatures, dangerous and tame.\" As the resounding voice echoed, Camilla began to jerk again as whatever had entered her body, left just as fast.It was as if she had floated through a pleasant dream for that moment... She saw glimpses of her past flying before her gaze, though nobody else could see. A little girl with long golden hair, innocent eyes, running free through the forest with her feet bare. The childish laughter, bubbling passed those pretty lips, as she cried out with glee that she had no worries or cares. She saw her mother, who was trailing along behind her.\"One day, little princess, this will all be yours... The forest, the kingdom, and the skies above it. You will be the one to protect it, child. This is your legacy.\"\"It is?\" breathed the little girl... \"But what will my little brother or sister protect?\"The woman, whose image Camilla took after almost identically, smiled at her young one. \"You.\" She said simply. \"He... it will be a boy, I am certain... He will protect you. You are of the forest, and he of the castle. That is important for you to remember, Camilla.\"\"I shall cherish the forest, mama. I promise,\" the young one said, and giggled softly as the pixies flitted around her playfully. \"This will always be my home... Forever and ever!\"She slowly came to. By the time her eyes opened, she was staring at the sky in confusion. Had she just fainted?? What the??

Supposedly, the sapphire had been created because of the death of a dragon. Jun had been reading about dragons and other mythical creatures in her spare time, so she knew a little something about these creatures and their life cycles. Dragons in particular had the potential for a rather astonishing demise. Occasionally the life force within their bodies underwent a process called \"environmental diffusion\", which caused whatever element they controlled to be released as a massive burst and affect their environment for centuries.

How come there was no environmental diffusion in the Land-Tiller's Expanse, where her grandmother had felled a dozen dragons single-handedly? One possible answer was that Lynx somehow managed to seal the magic into artifacts, just like the gemstone. But then what happened to them?

In other words, that part of the legend was a lie, a cover-up, and it was really four dragons that died to make the gems.The idea itself led to a third question. Could the slaughter of four dragons have been the REAL cause of the Cataclysm? The gems were supposedly created long ago, but is it possible the dragons only found out about it relatively recently? Was it some kind of conspiracy, a lie that four different mythical creatures were used when really it was four dragons?Was the cataclysm an act of vengeance?...Of course, Jun kept all of this to herself. Camilla and perhaps even Anid wouldn't know anymore about the whole thing than she did. One of the lessons that her father taught her was that history was subjective and malleable. So who knows what really happened?Maybe it didn't really matter.(Sigh) Why couldn't she have been paired with Sinclair?! He was cute, and might have helped distract her from her own head...\"Quit poking me!\" One of Camilla's pixie friends saw fit to harass her nose, which was relatively small.

If not, Jun could also practice her forms that Jill tried to teach her concerning her new weapon, which she did... until Camilla suddenly started talking to herself and passed out...\"Ok, wasn't expecting that.\" Jun ran up to Camilla and extended her hand to help her up. \"You ok?
