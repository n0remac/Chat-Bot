It seemed a shadow would move around every stone, every hill, and every trunk.  A sound would arise, but a source could not be determined.  The old oaks threatened to smash them, groaning as they passed by.  The sloshing of boots and horse hooves was the only thing that grounded the men to reality.  The thick, black mud stank of death and decay, covering almost everything on the forest floor.\"What is your greatest fear, Brother?\" he would ask Audric as they continued on.
