Two bold steps brought her forward to suddenly intercept Warden in his own tracks. What might have proven detriment to a less practiced fighter was no issue to Jill, who came from a very artistic culture heavily steeped in acrobatics and the martial arts.In her experience, his lack of power behind the longsword's cut bespoke a hesitation, accidental or intentional. Intercepting him mid-step as well as mid-strike, she sought a rare chance to use muscle over an opponent who was bigger than her, seeing as how the force of his blade-wielding arm was not to its greatest potential. Ending her advance with her left foot forward, the same forearm snapped down in a low block against his oncoming sword, the light metal plates on her bracers presenting themselves to the longsword's lightly cutting edge. Seeking to keep her bracer against the edge of his horizontal blade as he advanced his final step on her, she'd allow it to 'ride' up its length, from foible to forte, where her pale hand would grasp tightly around the crossguard of his sword. Such would happen very quickly as both combatants had advanced on one another, and very likely to his surprise.Her right arm, in tandem, reached down across her body for the hilt of her left peshkabz dagger. In the motion of her grapple, she'd draw her blade, and should she find the crossguard and ricasso of his sword in her left hand, she'd simultaneously slash with her draw, intending to inflict grievous damage to his right side.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "For a second, she stood there, looking him in the eyes with a kind of deer-that-isn't-Clyde in headlights kind of gaze.

Instead, he took a different and more effective approach to dealing with the situation and carrying on the assault.As Jill's arm crossed her body, Warden did the same, his left hand crossing his muscular torso beneath his extended right arm and armpit, the palm opened wide to \"catch\" the girls oncoming sword wrist just in time to grapple it to a halt just inches from his side. It was a close call. The girl he had stopped for jewelry was incredibly fast. But so were the gears in Warden's experienced mind. And because of this, he found a grave opening in Jill's reckless assault that allowed him to continue his own.Assuming he has taken the opponents left hand under his own grapple (which would have been much easier than Jill's grapple of his sword), his own right hand remaining in the clutches of her own hold, he moved forward suddenly, his right knee shooting upward in a kneeing bludgeon to Jill's left rib cage with force enough to knock her off her feet.
