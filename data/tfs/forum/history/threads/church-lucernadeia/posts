''We are warriors of light, fighting against heretics, heathens, undead and darkness. We seek to rid the world of our enemies, and we will do it with steel and fire.''The  Church is a centralised system that stays close to it\u2019s homeland near the Cathedral of the Sun. Followers of The Light rarely travel far from the Cathedral, but if they do it's to found new settlements and to spread the word of The Light.The Cathedral of the Sun is an enormous structure made out of sandstone and white marble It initially started of as a small church that could house a maximum amount of 300 people. Over the years additions were added to the church until 657 years ago when its name was changed to ''the Holy Cathedral of The God of Light the Sun'' by the current Archbishop at the time, the name was shortened shortly after.MillitairyThe army of the church consist entirely of the followers of the sun. The army is a small group elite soldiers, mainly cavalry. During times of peace it would be quite small but when in times of peril the Archbishop would call for all believers to come to the Cathedral where they would be armored and trained for battle.The new recruits function as simple spear or pike militia or as archers. These function as padding for the elite core of units that form the spearhead to break the enemy's lines.The elite part of the army consists of :- 110 flying heavy cavalrymen known as the Riders of Light. They are led by Bishop Etrefulgonse.- 340 heavy cavalrymen, either knights or priests.- 400 dismounted knights, they serve as heavy infantry.- 150 pavise crossbowmen. Well armed and armored so they can fend off any attackers that get too close.- 600 spearmen, these consist of either professional soldiers or priests in training.- 7 war elephants. These enormous white beasts are considerably larger than their more common grey cousins. Archer nests and ballistas are mounted on their backs giving them even more offensive\u00a0capabilities.Then there are also the untested peasants and workers that make up the largest amount of the army. They are lightly armored in leather and light mail and they wear rough woollen gambesons under the armor, instead of the fine white clothes the elite wear.The less skilled part of the army consists of :- 1000 units of spear and sword millitia. They carry swords, large shields and spears. They are mainly used to form spearwalls against infantry or to fight off cavalry.- 400 units of pike millitia. They are used as defensive units, protecting flanks and valuable positions.- 310 peasant crossbowmen. Less armored and equipped but more flexible versions of the elite pavise crossbowmen.- 1500 miscellaneous troops. These are untrained and unarmored peasants carrying little to no armor and using either makeshift weapons or agricultural tools. These are seen as ferociously devoted  believers by the Church, and as madmen and extreme fanatics by others.OrganisationThe hierarchy of the church has the Archbishop on top. The more \u2018Devoted\u2019 one is to the faith (The word devoted is interpreted differently from person to person,) the higher of rank they are.But in reality it is usually the Archbishop and the council of bishops who decide if an priest should rise through the ranks.The religious ranks are as follows, from lowest to highest :- Priest-in-training. These are mere acolytes, working in the Cathedral performing several functions.- Lower priests. These serve under a high priest. Most of these prefer to fight over rising through the ranks.- High priests. These serve under a Bishop. It is possible for them to become Bishop if the one they had served under dies and the Council of Bishops decide to appoint the High priest as his successor.- Bishops. There are only 28 bishops in total, they advise the Archbishop and help control the Church. - The Archbishop. He is the leader of the Church and his words are sent from the one true god, the Sun himself.The militairy and the religious functions of the church are heavily entwined in each other, many priests also serve as footsoldiers and cavalry, and the Bishops fight together in the army, all led and commanded by the Archbishop.ContactingWe, the church, are always looking for new members. Have we interested you and convinced you to finally step into the light of the sun? Then visit the Cathedral of the Sun\u00a0and request an audience with the one known as Bishop Symon of the East. He will listen to what you have to say, and if he thinks that you are devoted enough, he will allow you into the church and grant you the rank he feels as fitting.(Edit : Thanks to Madame Noaki for pointing out the mistakes in the text so i could fix them.)", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1662/cathedral-sun"], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/v3CA1ld.png"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><font size=\"6\">The\u00a0Church of Lucernadeia<br><br/><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/v3CA1ld.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/><br/></br></font></div>"}, "post-37946": {"user": null, "user_num": null, "timestamp": "1463341980000", "message": "Top-o-the mornin', Father Connor o'Murph (lower priest) here, serving under the Bishop Odilon Keyes.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Top-o-the mornin', Father Connor o'Murph (lower priest) here, serving under the Bishop Odilon Keyes."}, "post-37968": {"user": null, "user_num": null, "timestamp": "1463348415000", "message": "OOC 'n' crap: can I be a \"totally sane\" firebrand preacher?

My preacher dude will be up soon. Music for the characterIn the early days of the church a priest was sent to a tribe of cannibals, to hopefully convert them. While they did not kill and eat him right away, this was merely because they were busy with other things. The chief of the tribals laughed as the man preached of the sun, and how his lessons were unheeded by the people. He laughed as he took his time to heal the sick and stand up for the disabled. Soon, he stopped laughing and was confused by this man, and began to listen to his teachings. However, one of his tribesmen killed the man right in front of him, and the tribals gathered to feast on the preacher. The chief felt an anger he never had before, and that was the end of his tribe. The chieftain had torn to shreds the tribe, and taken the preacher's body over his shoulder. He began to journey into the direction the man came from. He was about to die of thirst and exhaustion as he saw the cathedral of the sun, all bright and beautiful. He went to this place of splendour, feeling overpowered by it's sheer wonder. He brought the corpse to the leader, and while he did not know their spoken language, he knew the language of the world. He joined these people in sorrow, he cried over the man's death, and he became one of them. He helped everyone, and he saw how to be civilized, and peace. But he had to remember his old skills soon. The people were under attack by mutants, deviants and heathens. He volunteered that he be the sole fighter, not wishing the others to come to harm. He told them who he truly was, and how this would be his penance. He took an eternal vow, and was ensconced in a permanent suit of armour. He was given blessings, and as the people hid all over, many were cynical. They did not believe a single person could fight off this horde of evil, but they were surprised to see that he could.\u00a0 They gazed upon this holy warrior, upon this great man of piety, and saw him as a warrior to protect the people of Lucernadeia. Thus, he travels the world, spreading the wonder of the sun, and smiting those he must.
