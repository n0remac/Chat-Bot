The door is no bigger then your average man. The outside is made of what looks like stone but is nothing more then painted wood. The roof made from thatch. The inside as an assortment of items for all of the shoppers, from food to weapons and armor. It is small but in some strange way Sam always has what you need.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Set up on the outskirts of Stonevale is a small shop.\u00a0"}}
