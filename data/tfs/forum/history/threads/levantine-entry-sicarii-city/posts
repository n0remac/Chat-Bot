On each side of the towers, primordial language is carved inside a beveled elliptical of diamond fragments. Armed guards can be seen within the towers, and patrolling on the carvetto cornices. Although they do not stop everyone - visual scrutiny is apparent, and those deemed suspect will be questioned. At any given time, there are three guards on duty - adorned in armor and great helms with dragon symbolism and wings.
