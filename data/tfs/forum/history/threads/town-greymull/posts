It was shocking, and Ralf was still dealing with the guilt that came with it.  He had just slaughtered who knows how many people in the past two months.  Unfortunately, not even his resourceful mother could find a suitable way for him to deal with the 'curse'.  Ralf had not slept well for days; the beast would come out at night, denying him rest, and wander aimlessly in the wilderness.  Fortunately, Ralf was able to keep the beast away from populated areas; it was hard to accomplish, but since the revelation, Ralf found he could force his own consciousness into the White Wolf's mind.  But it was still a problem, and Ralf feared that one day the beast might overcome him..And so Ralf traveled, once more.  No longer was he in a gleeful quest to build his legacy; he was forced into a desperate search for help: someone in this world had to know something.  If only Hirhan was around, he thought.  The Roaming Warrior's quest would bring him to the Town of Greymull. He had only a limited time here, however, for once the sun started to set he'd need to high-tail it into the wilderness.Ralf walked down the streets until he heard the banging of a hammer upon iron.  \"Blacksmith,\" he said to himself.
