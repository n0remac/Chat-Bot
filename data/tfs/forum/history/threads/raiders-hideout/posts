One of the two smaller Brothers in the party gave up his horse and rode with his ally, so Kelly would have a suitable mount all to herself.  She would find the beast healthy, strong, agile, and well-groomed.  Indeed the Brothers took great care of the warhorses, valuable as they were, and it definitely showed.Heinrich led the band in a northeastern direction, abandoning the road in favor of some forests.  He did not want the raiders to see his party approaching.  They rode for several hours until the winds grew stronger and their breath turned to mist.  A light snowfall showered the forest; one might observe the weight of ice bearing down on the frozen tree branches.  The horses trotted over twigs and roots, covered in a film of snow, and every so often an owl or squirrel shook the limbs, casting flakes on the waypassers.\"Lady Winter still holds these lands in her grasp,\" Heinrich softly spoke to Kelly, riding beside her.  \"A steady southwestern wind blows down from the chilly mountains; Autumn and Summer must fight hard for control of this region.\"Ultimately they came to the edge of the forest and dismounted.\u00a0 \"No fires,\" Heinrich said to his men, \"and no noise.\"\u00a0 The horses were attended to by some of the Brothers while Heinrich led Kelly to some bushes overseeing a valley.\u00a0 It was a wide valley, with a central road leading north and south.\u00a0 To the east and west were frosty forests, the latter of which the group was hiding in.\u00a0 Right in the middle of the area, sitting on the road itself, was a great stone fortress.\u00a0 It had seen better days, that was for sure, but despite its ruined appearance it still served its purpose.\u00a0 The walls were high enough that it had to be scaled by tall siege ladders.Heinrich pointed to the four watchtowers, one on each corner of the square fort.\u00a0 Kelly might see the faint flicker of torches and lanterns, especially now since the sun was starting to set.\u00a0 \"Archers and crossbowmen watch the roads.\u00a0 We can't get anywhere near without being spotted.\"\u00a0 He then pointed at the southern gate, which they could see; the northern gate was on the other side of the fortress.\u00a0 \"Doors swing open quickly, and by hand; no mechanisms to work.\"He waited for a few moments and finally said \"I'd wager a good thirty men or more wait inside.\"\u00a0 He looked over at Kelly with a worried face.\u00a0 \"If you're having second thoughts, I don't blame you.\u00a0 But if you'd like to help... well, I'll let you decide the best course of action.\u00a0 So, any ideas?\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><u><i><b>Raiders Hideout</b></i></u><br/></div>"}, "post-63183": {"user": null, "user_num": null, "timestamp": "1492467249000", "message": "Kelly squatted on the ground as he spoke, eyeing over the fortress walls and the guards on its towers.

They would hold, certainly, but the entire compound would crumble to dust in the event of a real siege.  Each guard tower provided a central fire pot, providing heat to the watchers and fuel for fire arrows.  Wooden stairways replaced the original stone ones, and led down into the courtyard.  The square courtyard contained racks for weapons and armor, and stables for horses - of which there were many.  Dominating this courtyard was a large keep in the center.The keep was as high as the guard towers, and provided its own walkways above so defenders could fire down on besiegers should they enter the courtyard.  It had no windows, and only two arched doorways: one in the north and one in south.  Kelly would be able to see damage done to the keep from ages past, but it had since been boarded up with wood.Each guard tower housed three watchers, all armed with crossbows or bows.  Racks containing rocks and javelins were nearby.  That put 12 men on guard duty.  A few other men, skinny and sheepish-like, shoveled horse dung from the stables.  Boisterous laughter and frantic crying echoed from out of the southern doorway of the central keep.  The rest of the raiders must be inside there.\"Open the gate!  Open the gate!\"  A bell started to ring loudly and if Kelly looked northward she'd see a band of horsemen riding south, towards the northern gate.  Two men from the guard towers cursded and ran down below to unlock the gate and push it open.  Seven men on horses came into the courtyard and dismounted by the stables.  They slapped and laughed at the stable boy, who urged the steeds inside after the raiders removed some large bags.

But their was no time to wipe it away now, for blood-curdling screams came from within the keep.The Knight-Brothers hoisted their shields and slammed the doors of the keep open, forming a shield wall.  They entered into a vast hall with high ceilings; torches burned on the walls and a central firepit emanated with roast pork.  On the opposite end of the room was a single man aiming a crossbow at a half dozen women.The women were all young and fair, but bloodied and malnourished.  They were stripped naked, having served as the playthings for the vagrants here.  They were crying and pleaded for their lives, clasping their hands together and praying to their god.  They shook with fear and were unable to move away from the corner.\"Don't move!  Nobody move!  I'll kill them!  I mean it!\"  The bandit shook nervously, threatening to kill any woman who dared flinch.Heinrich lowered his shield and removed his helmet, slowly approaching the center of the room.  He paused abruptly as the bandit started to squeeze the crossbow's trigger.  \"Pull that trigger and be damned for all eternity\" the Knight-Brother said.  His face displayed sorrow, for it pained him to see the women as they were, and it would rip his heart out to see any one of them killed.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "In a matter of minutes Kelly and the Knights would find themselves stumbling around on broken bodies and rolling heads.

The others clamored around her and began bawling loudly until they were comforted by the other Brothers.  Heinrich ripped a piece of cloth from his dirty cloak and wrapped a tourniquet around the woman's upper arm.  \"She needs medical attention,\" he said worriedly.  His breathing began to get heavy and he became very anxious.  Clearly this entire series of events troubled him.  It shook him to his core, and despite his efforts he could not push away the thoughts of what these women must have went through.Heinrich and the Knights wrapped the women in their white cloaks to keep them warm, borrowing some of the fur and leather clothing worn by the bandits.  They would be ferried back to the forest and given a ride to a nearby town.Heinrich would meet Kelly outside of the courtyard once his Brothers took charge of the women.  \"Oi, lass,\" he said gloomily, avoiding eye contact.  Before she could look at the tears streaming down his face shoved his helmet on.  \"You did good... we couldn't have done it without you...\"  He extended one arm to shake Kelly's hand, showing his gratitude and appreciation.  \"Inside you'll find a trap door leading into a small basement filled with riches and jewels.  They're yours... you earned them.\"The Knight-Brother offered her one last weary glance from beneath his helmet and turned to leave.[exit]", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"Hng,\" the bandit grunted in pain as Kelly's arrow found its spot in his neck.
