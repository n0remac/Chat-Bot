The trees seemed to lean in on the path, and the lanterns flickered as she passed. A coincidence, perhaps? Who could tell, really? As she walked, she would spot several bright lights moving around in the woods, along with heavy footsteps. Listening closer, she'd hear cheerful chatter and the clanking of pots and pans.
