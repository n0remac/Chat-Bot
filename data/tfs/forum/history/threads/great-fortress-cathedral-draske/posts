Though few have ever and will ever see it, Draske is the home of not only the feared Norkari Inquisition but also the Everlasting Wife of Draxenssehs, Khatun. Few are permitted here and as a result, this mysterious place is subject to many stories that tell of it's wonders and secrecy while only the most important and worthy members of Norkari society can expect to find themselves invited. Yet even more than this, only the Draxis themselves are allowed to set foot here under usual circumstances; only those sharing the blood of their god can visit his most holy site.\u00a0As mentioned before, Draske is the collective name for both mountains and the structures that inhabit them: Drask Fortress and Draske Cathedral. The first mountain, Draske Fortress, acts as the entrance to this holy place and one must climb twelve thousand steps through the ice and snow of the mountain before coming face to face with the great keep and the gate that blocks all outsiders. The fortress is large and incredibly well defended, for the very act of climbing an army up the mountain to attack it would be a miracle by itself even before the stone walls blocked your path and arrows rained down upon you from the walls with boiling oil. It also acts as the garrison house of the mainstay of the inquisition's forces, with the footsoldiers and lower officers of the inquisition all living and performing religious duty here when not on assignment.The second mountain is Draske Cathedral, which can only be reached if the two gates of Draske Fortress are opened to you and the long and narrow bridge that separates one mountain from the next is crossed. Far more impressive and inspiring than the fortress, the Cathedral has been carved into the very peak of the mountain itself as though the mountaintop was cut away and rebuilt in an image of religious splendour. The cathedral, for all intents and purposes, is far greater than it's twin keep, which in comparison is both smaller, less architecturally creative and less defended; it is also more open, with only the most noteworthy, elite and highest ranking of the inquisition allowed to cross to the home of the Everlasting Wife. Draske Cathedral is intimidating indeed, with great statues of Draxenssehs, spires and windows covering the sides, while a single great gate allows entrance to the cathedral's interior. The cathedral is guarded by mysterious forces of the Inquisition, so secret that few of the officers of the organization truly know of them; it is extremely rare for them to be seen, even when given the privilege of entering, yet a single step out of line will quickly lead to your demise by their hands. These cathedral custodians are also the sworn protectors of the Everlasting Wife Khatun, who lives deep within the cathedral interior and delivers to the Norkari the word of Draxenssehs in hushed sermon.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/YGWaqhG.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/YGWaqhG.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/><br><br/><b>The Great Fortress-Cathedral of Draske<br/><br/></b>Hidden deep within the labyrinth that are the Norkari Mountains, Draske refers to the twin structures that adorn two mountain peaks; one a great cathedral and the other a fortress, separated from each other by a deep chasm yet remaining joined by a single bridge between them.\u00a0<br/><br/>Though the Draxis Lords govern their local people from their own holdings, The Great Fortress-Cathedral of Draske acts as the religious and cultural heart of the entire Norkari world.
