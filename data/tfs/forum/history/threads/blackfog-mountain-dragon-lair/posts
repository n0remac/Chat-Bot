Black-Fog Mountain was what the locals apparently called it. He had two options here, come directly, or use stealth. He chose the latter option, and a fair distance away from the Mountain he changed forms. A dark substance left his pores, and cocooned him clothes and all, his form rippling like water, shrinking in some places, elongating in others, as limbs contorted. Within less than a moment a rather large Wolf was standing in his place. Its pelt a mixture of obsidian and silver, but looking relatively mundane save for the fact the fur would be unnaturally thick and dense, forming layers over layers as the outer layer was deceptively sharpened, the Lupine like creature wearing a pelt of knives. He also took the time to camouflage his signature to that of a mundane Wolf, adapting his physiology along with the presence that most might try to glean. He made his way slowly as a normal creature would. But little by little moved closer to the lair, gathering as much information as he could about his surroundings. His physiology had been adapted for the most part, but that pelt was certainly not like a mundane lupine's, but discerning the composition from a distance would prove a difficult task perhaps, if nothing else however he had done this to protect himself from the mosquitoes, but since they seemed to be linked to the same malevolence of the birds he had a hypothesis that they might also act as \"drones\" for recon purposes as well as to spread disease and misery perhaps. This was not his first rodeo, and he was not married to the idea of his hypothesis but it seemed likely. Perhaps he was a fool for coming upon this place alone, but he doubted such a thing. Dragons were hardly the biggest fish in the sea where he came from, and though Fenris could not compete with such a things brute-force there were other methods with which to contest such a creature, it was simply a matter of finding the most appropriate. The bindings that allowed him to remain on an even tier with basic-humans were self-imposed by a sense of pride and honor. He enjoyed sport, and there was no sport to him in simply overwhelming a being with more power than they could possibly possess, but at the very least, despite Fenris' \"bravery\" in testing the beasts sphere of influence, he felt he knew more or less what to expect, and the power he himself could bring to bear was considerable if need be.

The Dragon bathing the area was enough for Fenris to roll behind what remained of cover to lessen the second swath. The landscape burned to a crisp. \"Fuck...\" he released his cloak and the Dragon walked off. Should he go after it? He was getting a bit more roughed up than he was used too, the price he paid for meddling in such affairs. The Dragon would only come back again, at best Fenris had at least delayed its effort, and possibly enraged it. He could not seem to reason with it, and yet he felt somewhat guilty for introducing himself as another Apex-Predator in the region.He gave a sigh and allowed himself to feel the pain a bit more, he took a swig of his canteen, imbibing the mead. Could he really live with himself if because of what he did the Dragon would take it out on the towns-folk. It looked like he was roughing it, he could not leave any loose ends, but for the time being, the both of them could recover as he knew both combatants were hurting, yet something inside him urged to press, he repressed that wild-call with irritated fatigue and laziness. \"Later...\" he told himself.
