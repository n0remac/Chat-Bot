It's filled with mostly disturbing things, I wouldn't suggest you reading it yourself, this man was quite \u300cunsavory\u300d. Apparantly the jar he had with him contained \u300cbrains\u300d from all his victims and he recorded the properties and differences of each brain. This also all seems to be written in \u300ccrayon\u300d, but he didn't have any crayons on him.\" Doobie shoes the notebook scribblings, there were some odd doodles on each page. He then starts flipping through the book. \"But there was something useful in here, pertaining to my \u300cquest\u300d. One month ago he wrote here, 'Today while I was at the \u300cSteelscape\u300d, I bumped into a Katashiman man. I cursed at him and told him to watch himself, made fun of his hair, and started to walk away, next thing I knew I had been \u300cstabbed\u300d. I looked down at my chest to see something that looked like an \u300carrow\u300d head, but smaller and ornately decorated. Next the thing was pulled out through my back and I passed out. When I woke up, I discovered \u300csomething\u300d was with me that wasn't there anymore. When I looked at it, it felt familiar, like we were family. It told me its name is \u300cBig Squeeze\u300d and that its a part of me.'\"So now it seems the one who carries the \u300cDart\u300d and \u300cAtlatl\u300d stabbed this man with the \u300cSpirit Dart\u300d and made him into a \u300cStand User\u300d like us.
