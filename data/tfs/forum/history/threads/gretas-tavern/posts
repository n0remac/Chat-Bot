It certainly looked comfortable enough. He ordered some pork roast and a glass of water (trying his best not to smile), then turned to the old man across the table. Finally, he was speaking! Perhaps he was just so old that the rigors of riding a horse had gotten him so out of breath that he couldn't talk.\"About me? Um...I live in Gauldin, at the academy. I grew up at my family's estate, though. I used to live with Gran and my cousin Roxy. Lots of other relatives, too. Uncles, aunts, more cousins...there were a lot. I'm going back to visit them now.

Nothing else piqued his interest, but he decided to inquire about the lad's family. \"You've lots of relatives?  Are they vampires too?\"  A family of nice vampires. Grey grinned at the idea. He also wondered about Gauldin; probably a wretched place of vampiric folk. Eh, he wouldn't judge, as he had never been; he was a newcomer here, and should not assume to much. Before Royal Fletcher  could answer, he continued: \"adventurer like you... bet you been around. Seen some interesting places. I reckon I could use a guide... or the certain talents of a vampire.\"  Raising his cup of ale he'd say \"how'bout we drink to a new friendship?\"  If Royal bumped mugs, Grey would take a gulp of his drink. The next moment the door of the inn busted open and three armored men came in like they owned the place. \"...right in 'er bunghole!\" one was finishing a sentence. The other two burst into a wild laughter. Grey snarled his nose and gritted his teeth, hiding his expression behind his mug. The men dragged the chairs from another table and went into a boisterous conversation about raping, looting, and killing. \"Aye, whore at the bar!\" they yelled to Greta. \"Bring me 'n my boys here some fuckin' ale!  Hurry up fer I drag ye out back!\"Greta went to getting the ale and Grey went to snarling his nose; this time, there was no mug to hide his expression. The obnoxious man spied it and squinted in Grey and Royal's direction. \"Aye, fuck you lot lookin' at?  You got a problem with how I do things?\"Another man growled and stood up, his chair scratching across the floor. \"I know that man.  Yeah... use to ride with him.\"  He started walking to where Grey and Royal was, joined by his two compatriots. \"Use to take turns fuckin' this wench we had.\"  Grey started to squeeze his mug but said nothing. He tried not starting any trouble. \"We all had her... then this prick let her go. After fuckin' her, that is.  Mm, some nice hole that was, eh man?  Remember her, all pale, with rosy cheeks and that ashen white hair?  And not white like old, just white like... like exotic. Course you and me ripped that hair out, turned that pale skin all black and blue, and the only rosy red color about her was the blood.  Look at'em, sittin' with this lad. What is he, your fuckin' catamite?\"That was it. Grey had had enough. He slammed his mug down. By now two trouble-makers were standing behind Fletcher and Grey, with the third in front. A long moment of intense silence followed. Grey moved his hand to his axe. \"Lad,\" he said next, \"Smile.\"Grey stood up and twisted around simultaneously, bringing the axe wedge down onto a man's metal helmet. It cracked the metal and injured the man, who yelled painfully. Grey pulled the axe away and then hacked at the man's face, burying the wedge into his cheekbone. Meanwhile, another of the pricks worked to grab Royal around the neck, while the final man drew a knife and tried stabbing Fletcher in the eye.

I don't like monsters, or the dark...I suppose it would be less scary if I'm not on my own, though. And I have been to lots of places. Sure, we could work together!\"After all, he figured, he should probably help this poor tired old man out. You were supposed to be nice to the elderly, weren't you? He raised his own mug (full of water), clinking it against Grey's. When the noisy men came in, Roy tried his best to shrink away and ignore them. They seemed like trouble, and trouble was something he tried to avoid. Thus, he missed the comment about the girl with the white hair. Still, he noticed when the men lunged across the bar for the pair of them. Why was Grey telling him to smile? This wasn't a smiling situation at all! He did his best to smile, but it ended up being more of a panicked grimace. As the two men came after him, he jumped away, knocking his chair over in an attempt to escape.

The guy was nearly knocked out; he was at least dazed and fell to his knees. Grey then grabbed him by the collar and belt, picked him up clear over his hand, and slammed him onto the table. The old man was very clearly stronger than he looked. As the monster hunter was busy sliding his opponent across the tables, Fletcher was faced with a maniacal, roaring, jagaloon.
