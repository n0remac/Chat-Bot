His spiritual journey over, he felt he had enough of walking for awhile. The runner stopped just in front of Sakura Inn. Junrei hopped out and flipped a coin into the runner's hands. The swordsman pushed his way through the cloth sheets hanging over the entrance.Junrei found some vacant seating, a section made to look like the dining room of a house, complete with sliding doors.  The wait staff was busy, as it was lunch hour. The owner found himself doing double duty as a manager and waiter. The owner was solemn and taciturn, likely having seen it all in his time running the inn.\"What can I get ya?\" he asked.\"A cup of tea and some ramen,\" Junrei replied.A look of confusion flashed across the owner's face.\"What kind of tea and ramen?\" he replied. \"We have all kinds.\"\"Any. I don't have preferences, it's against my personal code.\"The owner shrugged and left to fulfill the order, as vague as it was. After a few minutes, the owner returned with a tray of green tea and miso ramen.Junrei had his lunch and paid the inn keeper. He made for the door, when he saw a middle-aged woman come through the entrance. Her face looked familiar, though Junrei couldn't place it. The inability to recognize her bothered the swordsman. He lingered by the doorway, as the woman found a low lying table and knelt on a mat in front of it. A moment later, a waitress brought over a steaming pot of tea. Suddenly, Junrei realized she had the same facial features as someone he had accidentally killed in a duel. His suspicions were confirmed when he noted the silver crescent mon embroidered into her sable kimono.Junrei walked over to the table, as the woman wrapped her fingers around the teapot's handle.\"May I pour you a cup?\" Junrei offered.\"Thank you,\" she said, with a slight smile.\"That's Genmaicha blend isn't it?\" Junrei asked. \"Haven't had that in a long time.\"\"You may sit with me and have some if you like.\"\"Thanks.\"Junrei sat down and the woman poured his cup. He bowed in gratitude and enjoyed the first sip.The swordsman slipped a hand beneath his robes, producing a tanto, a katana shaped dagger. He set it on the table with a soft thud. The woman looked back at him with a hard gaze.\"Lady Naito, I am Junrei,\" the swordsman said. \"I took the life of your firstborn son Ichiro.\"\"I know. My family doctor examined Ichiro. He recognized the cuts were consistent with your style.\"\"I promise you it was unintentional. We agreed to fight, and we knew the risks. Still, I am guilt ridden for having taken such a young life. I offer you mine in return.\"To show his resolve, Junrei slid the tanto toward the lady.Naito's eyes went downcast at the blade. Junrei studied a mix of emotions come over her; sadness, vengeance, temptation and acceptance. Her slender fingers left the warmth of the teacup and slid toward the weapon before finally stopping. Finally she tore her gaze away from the tanto and stared back at Junrei with glistening eyes.\"Another death would not accomplish anything,\" she said. \"All his life Ichiro practiced the sword, he idolized you and others in your profession. I remember the way he'd practice every day, until his father had to wrest the training sword from his blistered hands. Ichiro died honorably, following his passion. If you live on, and use your talents for good, all is forgiven. I know Ichiro would have wanted that.\"Junrei felt as a great weight was lifted from his shoulders. He returned the tanto to the pocket beneath his robes.\"I have used my skills for good, and will continue. I will never forget your son's sacrifice or your words today.  Thank you Lady Naito.\"Junrei stood up and bowed. Naito returned it. The swordsman left the inn and watched pink petals lazily drift from the cherry blossom tree across from the inn.
