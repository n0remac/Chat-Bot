He felt the weight of defeat pressing on his hefty shoulders. He hated feeling helpless, but helpless he was. Helpless to defeat that which had destroyed the meaning of his existence. The scenery changed from the crispness of New Brimiarde to the mossy time-worn desolation of the old city. Plants invaded every crevice of the place, making the city look more like a dense forest than a civilised establishment. An old building struck him with a certain nostalgic fondness. It was barely a shack now, but it was the only place in this part of the city that had stayed whole. An establishment that had stood the test of time, forgotten but not defeated. A building that shared many of his own qualities. He stepped through the door into the room's darkened interior. There wasn't a lot to speak of. I single table and two chairs sat to the side and every surface of the place was covered in a thick layer of dust. But one particular fixture of the shack caught Bryn's eye. A small lining on the floor at the back was untouched by dust. A trapdoor. Bryn approached it with caution and slowly but carefully pulled the wooden fixture from it's entrance. Bellow lay a wooden ladder down which Bryn climbed. Bryn tried to blink away the darkness but the underground room left him barely able to see. He tried to feel around for a something to orient himself and in doing so grabbed onto something hard and thick like the hilt of a sword. A lever. He pulled it down and a hard *clunk* followed a small *snik* and soon the room erupted in light. A thin trough full of oil led from the left of the door to a large fire pit in the centre of the room. Bryn took the opportunity to look around. In the corner of the room was a conservative bed, with blankets that looked old, but still workable, at the room's back there was a door. \"This place is bloody full of surprises\", Bryn thought to himself. What caught Bryn's eye next was a full map of the know lands of the realm on the right hand wall. It was fairly new. This hideout wasn't owned by somebody from the old days. On the ground was some chalk, Bryn picked it up and marked a small \"X\" in the free plains where he believed the Demon's tower to be. It was time to get to work.
