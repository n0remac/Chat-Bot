My older brother traveled east, taking me with him, to a place called Medan, where we lived for some time.

Respectful, honorable... he was a samurai, truly.\"Please,\" Kenjin began, still somewhat reluctant to reveal his past, \"if I tell you who I am, I'd ask you do not tell anyone except for your lord.  My name isn't really Guy.  It's Kenjin.  Kenjin Uesung.\"If Isao had been at least a little knowledgeable in the history of Katashima, the clan name 'Uesung' would strike a bell.  Katashima was once divided into various provinces, all ruled by separate warlords who vied for control.  The Uesung clan was a small clan, but became notorious and feared for their methods.  Known to be harsh and unforgiving, the Uesung clan left the code of the samurai behind them - mercilessly slaughtering their enemies on and off the battlefield; they were truly ruthless and uncontrollable.  The Uesung employed assassins of all kinds- ninja- to methodically kill enemy generals, politicians, and even warlords.  Considered dishonorable, the Uesung was finally defeated by a coalition of other warlords.  They were one of, if not the most hated family in Katashima at one point.  Kenjin and his older brother, Kagatatsu Uesung, fled the realm and was smuggled east, to Medan.Kenjin allowed his name to sink in for a moment.  \"I'm not proud of what my father did, or what his father did before him.  I don't know how many innocents they slaughtered.  I don't know how many good warriors were dishonorably killed.  but I know this: I've never killed an innocent man.  Never hurt a woman.  Never hurt a child.  I could not imagine doing such a thing.  I hope you understand why I've been being... secretive.  If the wrong people discovered this, they'd surely execute me.  The Uesung was suppose to have been eradicated - erased from the annals of history - for their treacherous war crimes.  Now I am the only one left.  And I've come home to restore my family's honor.\"Kenjin stood up and withdrew his katana.  Isao would then understand: this was no ordinary katana; this was tachi no Akuma - the Sword of the Demon.  There was no telling how much bloodshed this katana had seen.  No telling how many innocent men, women, and children had felt its sharp edge.  This thing was evil, and for it to turn up now - after so many years - could very well serve as an omen.\"I carry the Sword of the Demon.  Used by my brother, and our father, and his father before him.  The Blade That Carved a Dynasty.  That Killed an Emperor.  And now... the Blade That Forges a Destiny.\"  Kenjin sheathed his katana.  \"I wish to redeem myself.  My family.  Our honor.
