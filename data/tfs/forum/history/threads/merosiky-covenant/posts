After a long and life changing battle, the Merosiky name was reborn from the Darkness and rules over the now frozen lands known as the Azoni Valley. With a new chance at life comes a new purpose their life.The Merosiky are a new species of vampire created by the Darkness that gave life to the Azoni Valley. While they lack the need to breathe or sleep, they may choose to do either if it makes them feel comfortable. The Merosiky can walk in daylight but only for so long depending on how strong the Sun is that day and are not weakened by Holy magic. \u00a0Most metals strengthened these vampiric beings, but Silver was their Kryptonite. The most distinguishable traits of a Merosiky are their silver eyes and shapeshifting capabilities. \u00a0The Merosiky is a very tight knit covenant that serves as part of Frostborne and controls the Azoni Valley. Since the Merosiky are a newly forming covenant, many do not know of them yet and their family name has only one battle tied to it's name. This covenant is ready to prove their loyalty to Frostborne and keep their valley out of war.Current Members & Ranks\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sire - Rose MersoikyNitriarch - Gitmo MerosikyNitriarch - Ayzum MerosikyNitriarch - Lucius MerosikySire: Leader (Male)Syra: Leader (Female)Nitriarch: Enforcers/Secondary leader (Male)Mitriarch - Enforcer/Secondary leader (Female)LoyalistsAlpha Loyalist - Halu Kohas Alpha Loyalist: OfficerLoyalist: SoldierIf a person wants to become a Merosiky, they must first seek out a Merosiky.
