At the rear of the house, a rarely used back door leads into a small garden of flowers and grass; surrounded by tall, iron-fence walls topped by spikes. The Felhurss home was purchased when their leading male, a business man known as Richard, made bounds and leaps in his trading of goods between New Brimiarde and Stonevale. Though suspected of rather mild underhanded activity, the Felhurss family has been generally well-liked for donating to charitable causes and lowering prices for basic necessities such as meat.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Nestled in a row of middle-class homes, the well-to-do Felhurss family has owned their house for at least a year before the present day.

Any curious neighbour would soon see the street filled with a dozen guards, focused around the Felhurss family property. Doors were opened, a squad of men entered and a further two remained outside to guard the front entrance. For New Brimiarde, the evening just got a lot more interesting. Though not yet midnight, the entire street was abuzz and unable to sleep. The whispers of murder passed from home to home like a breeze and children were locked in their rooms and windows barred. A terrible crime had been committed and for many sleep would no longer be an option as the investigation began. - The murder scene covered the entire house. The sitting room, the master bedroom and the daughter's room each contained a corpse. The father in the first, the mother in the second and a young woman in the last. In each case, their throat had been slit and the body left to crumple; with a small pool of blood gathered around the neck. There had been no signs of struggle, no forced entry and no commotion was heard. Yet the murder weapon lay dropped in the dining room hall that sat in the centre of the house, tossed by the door that led to the stairs. Several guards searched the house to try and find clues.
