It stretches across the entire The Phoenix State. It it populated at it's calmer points by people who are not tied to any tribe, simply loyal to The Phoenix State. The lands along the river are the main choice for farming what plants they can for food. \u00a0This river is patrolled by Phoenix State Royal Forces. They keep a few boats in the water, but prefer to patrol from land. Throughout this river, Scout Union outposts can be found. All travelers must check in at these outposts. \u00a0Fish, Crocodiles, Red Hippopotamus, and other various species of aquatic life call this river home. The people tend to stray from waters known for Hippopotamus activity due to their interest in eating people. So other than avoiding the rocky rapids and sharp turns in the canyons, as well as the Red Hippo's, your trip should go smoothly so long as you comply.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dr9-By11a3U/UmPtik1smKI/AAAAAAAAC5s/3JCP_A6JP_M/s1600/nile-Gin%C3%A9s-Qui%C3%B1onero.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dr9-By11a3U/UmPtik1smKI/AAAAAAAAC5s/3JCP_A6JP_M/s1600/nile-Gin%C3%A9s-Qui%C3%B1onero.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/><br><br/>Ra River\u00a0</br></div>"}}
