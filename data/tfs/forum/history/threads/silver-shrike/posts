Although it had seemed urgent to her before, she seems hesitant now.She stays silent for several moments, before blurting out, \"I had a premonition! In the Wyld, you're going to face many challenges. This you know, but I also saw something more...ominous. I saw your body and soul being wreathed in dragonfire, your life melting away like ice before a furnace. Your heart beat its last as you drove your blade through the heart of the beast that did this to you, but you were still left dying within my arms. My Dreamwalks are almost always accurate...please, let me come with you into the Wylds! You are very important to the homeland and I can't let you die!\"At some point during her short speech, Gwen's brows have furrowed deeply and her full lips have taken on a concerned, pouty, almost sad expression, as if the thought of her prince dying truly hurts her inside.", "link_list": ["/user/1234"], "image_list": [], "html": "Once she takes a seat within the private quarters of "}, "post-40325": {"user": "King Averin Arach", "user_num": 1234, "timestamp": "1465099115000", "message": "\"Dragon fire?\"Averin's voice is tinged with something between curiosity and wry amusement. If what she was saying was true he was to make quite the legend for himself. Fighting and killing a dragon? That would make him a legend in his own right. Still if all of what she said was true he would die in the attempt. He eyes her for a long moment, the question was did he believe her? He knew virtually nothing about the woman, just that she was a witch and attractive. Exceedingly attractive actually especially when she pouted those full lips. He was getting distracted.\"I believe I already gave you leave to accompany us.\"With that settled Averin settles back into his chair. To distract himself from the nearly unnaturally alluring woman before him he turns his attentions to the maps. He sorts through his thoughts on the matters. Was he ready to fight a dragon? He hadn't done so yet, but that didn't mean he couldn't. He should re-read the strategies on it.
