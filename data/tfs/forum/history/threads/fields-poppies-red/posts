Over a million men had died there, in just over six weeks of fighting. The ground had been littered with corpses, the dead laying on top of the dead. Librarian Flanderic crested the hill that would over look the fields. When he finally made it to the top, the sight in front of him made him fall to he knees.\u00a0Stretched before him lay thousands of flowers. Hundreds of thousands of poppies, the color of the blood that had been spilt on this land. Flanderic grabbed the soil in front of him in his hands. The soil itself was imbuded with the flesh of the innocent. So many young men had died here, these men marched to their deaths and they knew it. Yet they never retreated, and they faced their death with pride on their faces.\u00a0This land is sacred now. A monument to the men that died here. Their bodies shall never grow old now. In death, they shall rest forever more. The Kingdom of Belrow shall never forget them, at the going down of the sun and in the morning, they shall remember them.\u00a0This story is dedicated to a good friend of mine named Alex. He died on July the 21 2013 serving his country. I shall always remember you.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://onthefly.onemillionskates.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/in-flanders-fields-the-poppies-blow.jpg"], "html": "The small party of the undead walked towards the where the bloodiest battle had taken place during the Great War.
