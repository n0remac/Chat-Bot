It was just added there to make the story more entertaining. As far as the rest went? This grizzled old fart is not far off the mark... Here is how the story goes (Imagine it in his voice, but for the purposes of those involved with the quest to get a clear understanding, the story will be in plain English.)It was a long time ago in a not so far away land, that there was a king who made friends with the wrong people. These people were a formidable force, and promised to protect the king and his people from across the border if the king promised his daughter in marriage to the prince of this darker king. The princess was aghast at how things were running, and this prince fellow was a brute and very arrogant. She could not bear it if she were to become his wife.Her declaration that she would not, could not, marry this prince, offended the evil king. You see, that king wanted this kingdom under his own rule, and he wanted the treasure that was supposedly hidden in those parts.One day, out of revenge for the rebuke, the evil king sent an army with the orders to kill every man, woman, and child unless the princess decided to spare the people and change her mind.

He looked around, as if trying to spot someone. Seeing a person that looked to be in charge of the inn, and hoping that this was the innkeepers apprentice that he had read about, he made his way over. He looked at the man for a moment, as if trying to remember why he was there, then hurriedly fished a piece of paper out of the satchel he wore over his shoulder. Slamming it down onto the counter, he looked back at the person he hoped was the one he was looking for.\"It says here you've lost your innkeeper. I'm a well travelled man, and I've always believed that a well run inn is the capstone of an enjoyable journey, and you'd best believe I like my journeys to be enjoyable. With that in mind, I feel inclined to retrieve this man for you so that this inn can continue to, well, run. I don't mean to belittle your skills, but I can only assume you're still an apprentice for a reason.\" He winked, laughing. \"Regardless of your skills, I'm happy to help. Give me all the information you have on his disappearance, and I'll find him for you.\" He patted a deflated coin sack hanging off his belt. \"I'll be needing that reward when I'm done, too. Now go pour me a drink, and tell me what you know. The names Atheas, by the way, but I've never really been troubled by what others call me.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "A thin, robed man wearing a wistful smile quietly made his way into the bar.
