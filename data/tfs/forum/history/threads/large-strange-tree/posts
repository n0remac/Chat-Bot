It had been a minor annoyance, but one well worth it, in the end, as her tree-house had become a proper home over the span of a couple of weeks.As nice as it was, she had been lonely. Apparently some of the Divines had been displeased with his acts at Bridge Town, and so after seeing to it that his intended was safely ensconced within her tree-turned-home, Azrael had departed back to the Afterworld, leaving Kalarys quite alone. It had been some time now since the Angel of Death had departed, and the red-haired woman was starting to wonder if he was going to come back at all, despite what he'd said. Had he been detained? Had he been punished, as he had when he'd returned her to life? In the end, worrying only served to irritate and upset her, so after downing a copious amount of wine, she had retreated to her bed.With the soft white sheets surrounding her, separated from her skin only by the crimson silk of the sleeveless nightgown she wore, Kalarys nestled into her bed and laid her head upon the pillow. It was a very short while before she slipped completely into a deep slumber, a trip that was assisted greatly by all the rich red wine that she'd consumed shortly before seeking out her bed. Unfortunately, it was not to be a peaceful night's rest.The emptiness which surrounded her was deep and malevolent, a writhing blackness that she could see and feel. It pulsed around her with a life all its own, threatening to reach out and consume her where she hovered in the endless void. Through the gloom ahead of her, she could see a light, one that somehow seemed familiar. As much as she reached for it, trying to run despite there being no ground beneath her feet, Kalarys never seemed to get any closer.Suddenly, the light pierced the darkness completely, and she knew why it felt so familiar. Azrael. He was within the light. But once the roiling black had cleared enough for her to see him, her heart twisted. Her beautiful, ageless betrothed was wrapped in chains of light, his arms and wings bound to him, keeping him from budging even an inch. All he was able to move was his face, his soulful crimson eyes staring at her beseechingly, his lips opening and closing as he spoke.. but his voice, that achingly lovely voice, never reached her ears.Reaching for him, struggling against the inky malice made solid that had suddenly wrapped around her arms and legs, Kalarys fought to reach him. She was so close.. just a few inches more... Her fingertips brushed against a single, pristine feather of the purest alabaster. Agony lanced across his face, as they were torn apart. She fought, wailed, strained for all she was worth, trying to reach for him as his light faded, dimmed, was swallowed by the impenetrable night around them...\"Azrael!\" The heartbroken scream erupted from her lips, escaping her aching throat as Kalarys sat bolt upright in bed. Her unbound hair was plastered to her brow and neck by a film of perspiration, her chest heaving with sobbing breaths as the agony of that nightmare, still remembered, swam within her thoughts. A shaking hand rose from where it had been clutching the sheets, brushing the sweat from her brow, and then descended only a few inches, furiously trying to wipe away the tears that clung to her cheeks, only for them to be replaced moments later by a new flood.Her body trembling, she huddled back against the canopy and the branches behind it that tried to whisper soothingly to her, their comfort ignored. Drawing her knees up, her forehead descended to rest upon them as her arms coiled around the silk-covered length of her legs. Giving in to the desire, she let the tears come as she sobbed helplessly. She had never believed in dreams of prophecy, but that had been far too intense, too real, to be anything else. Its meaning was clear: Azrael had been punished, for some reason, for what he'd done at Bridge Town.. and he was lost to her forever.The realization that the man who had comforted her, held her, kissed her, shown her such tenderness, called her his beloved and meant it, was forever out of her reach - never to be given the opportunity to awaken her heart, to see her respond with passion, to hear her discover and confess her love for him - wrenched at that very heart. She didn't love him.. he had said so himself. So why did it hurt so much? Was it simply loneliness? Or was it that the deep affection she had confessed had become more in his absence?

Just as she was about to step away from Azrael and move to clean up the mess of her little experiment, she found his wings and arms wrapping around her body. Keeping her gaze fixed downward, she closed her eyes, ignoring the tears that tumbled down her face as she did so. <font color=\"cc0000\">\"I love you, too, Azrael.\"</font><br/><br/>Hastily swiping the tears from her face, she opened her eyes and half-turned to face him, rising up on her toes to give him a quick kiss. When she pulled away, she forced a smile. <font color=\"cc0000\">\"It will be fine. I've done this before, remember? Admittedly, it's been about half a century, but I don't think that's something a mother really forgets.\"</font> Pulling away from him and gently pushing past the barrier of his wings, she began to clean up the counter, keeping her gaze fixed on her task. Making her voice stay carefree and untouched by the sadness that twisted her heart was difficult, but she managed.<br/><br/><font color=\"cc0000\">\"Besides, you'll probably be back in the Afterworld by the time this little one comes around, so you won't have to worry about a thing. I can handle this.\"</font> It wouldn't be the first time she'd raised a child alone. She loved Azrael, and she would miss him, but she wouldn't force him to be around a child he didn't want. With the detritus of the half-dismembered plants scooped into the basket, she stopped, staring at the blossom in the bowl. Her eyes flared green, and the bloom and its root system began to wither and fade, before finally crumbling into dust. Picking up the bowl and the basket, she moved to a far window and opened it, tossing the herbs and the bowl's contents both out into the wood beyond the portal.</br></font>"}, "post-32803": {"user": "Azrael", "user_num": 1104, "timestamp": "1460411714000", "message": "Apparently his betrothed had completely misunderstood what the angel had meant. He furrows his brow slightly in a faint frown as he stops her before she gets to the bowl, turning her head back to face him and gazing deep into her eyes, the crimson pools reflecting his oft-hidden gentle soul.\"My sweet, I would never leave you to care for a child on your own. You are mine, and I am yours. I am simply concerned that I will not be as good a father as you are a mother, but I will do my best,\" he says, before pulling her into a gentle embrace again and planting a heated kiss upon the woman's lips that drives his point home; it feels as if he'll never let go, never let her lips drift from his, even for a moment.Alas, good things never last forever, and after several minutes Azrael pulls back and allows her to empty the contents of the bowl, his eyes drifting slowly down her figure as he watches her work. To have a child with such a beautiful being...perhaps it is even more holy than angelic birth; she is certainly more kind than many of his ilk.Once she finishes cleaning up, he wraps his arm about her shoulder and leads her toward the baths, his cane tapping along the ground as he uses it to steady himself and remove his weight from his love.\"Come, let us relax together. I believe I wish to prove my dedication to you...\" he says, squeezing her tight as a hand snakes around to grasp at her chest...[Fade out ]", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Apparently his betrothed had completely misunderstood what the angel had meant.
