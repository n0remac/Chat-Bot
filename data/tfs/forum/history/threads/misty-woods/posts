What started as a rugged hike meandering through giant pines began to feel more and more surreal.

The environment, once they made it into the depth of the fog, was also missing other degrees of natural variation. The lack of vegetation, forest debris, local fauna, or even ambient sound, was sure to alert even the stoutest of brave hearts... The sheer monotony of massive tree trunks, their branches or canopies now fully enshrouded far above in mists that allowed only six or seven meters or visibility, and that of the dull grey boulders seen occasionally between trees, made plotting one's course or even figuring out where one was to be a maddening endeavor.

After pulling off the road and traveling a substantial distance across some lightly wooded area, they stop at a dense treeline. A few of the riders disembark and set about undoing the ropes that hold the cage to the cart. They then, with all due care, remove the cage from the cart and carry it between themselves toward the treeline. The cage is angled in such a way that the open side of the cage is facing the treeline. As they work, the men are silent, and perhaps more tense than they really ought to be, even considering the nature of their task. They are careful to stay very close to each other and keep the cart in sight. Once they are satisfied that the cage is well and truly into the forest, and Attla cannot see back out of it, they set the cage down on the forest floor, probably crunching a few twigs in the process. One of the men walks about to the front of the box, and kneels down ways away, directly in Attla\u2019s field of view. He raises his palm to display it to Attla, and then curves his fingers into a funny sort of gesture. Then his eyes begin to glow a bit, and he utters a single word, \u201cSluimeren.\u201dThe accent with which he pronounces it is perhaps reminiscent of elvish, but Attla doesn\u2019t have very much time to consider such matters, as that was a spell of sleeping, which quickly takes effect.Attla would most likely come back to his senses some indeterminate number of hours later. He would find that the cage has been unlocked, and the top left open. The soldiers, the cart, and all of the horses are nowhere to be seen. His shackles are still very definitely in place, holding his hands behind his back and preventing the utilization of magic. Further, Attla might also find himself a bit peckish, as the last time the soldiers fed him was several hours before dropping him off, and several hours have probably passed between then and now. If things have worked out to the soldiers\u2019 intentions, the woods would now surround Attla in the cage, and the edge by which he entered would not be in sight, but such things are not theirs to decide.

Her face looking a lot more serious now. \"It seems that my eye holds a lot more power then I thought it did.\" she started. \"I used to think it was a burden since I could not control it. No matter how interesting it sounds, it ain't fun to see people naked all the time, or walk into a washline because you simply didn't see the fabric hanging down from it.\" She paused and turned to Karath. \"I could clearly see where that thing was. I could see the attacks hit him clearly after I removed my eyepatch and saw through the illusion that it had created for us. What does that mean? What exactly is this eye and why do I have it? I know I was born with it, but noone has ever explained to me how or why I got it.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Abby smiled when she heard of Karath his decision to split them up together.
