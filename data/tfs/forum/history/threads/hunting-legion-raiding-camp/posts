The dull scales from the kiggies peeled away, revealing nicer shades of yellow, pink, purple, red, orange and blue. Loose clumped chunks of fur from the gnolls floated down in the river, letting the cleaner more vibrant brown, gray, blue, white and tan show through. A few had hesitations, this was their cover, their camouflage! How were they to hide so they could ambush people before a battle? Eventually, they all gave in and washed themselves too, hoping they wouldn't regret this when they had weapon piercing them.The guard wasn't very amused with Osma, but didn't feel like retaliating and let her go without a punishment. This time.There was quite a pause when Osma yelled, they all halted and turned, not sure why she was shouting. Most doubted her that it would look nice, and continued vigorously washing, not picking any up. A few however were finished scrubbing and snatched some sheets of scale up then waded through the shallow water and handed it to the noblewoman.", "link_list": ["/post/55457/thread", "/user/1823", "/user/1823"], "image_list": ["//storage.proboards.com/6046952/avatar/I9ct_J9uEe2pAWHGQ4Py.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@cwashington\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/55457/thread\" timestamp=\"1478190264\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-1823\" title=\"Osma Gaiman\"><img alt=\"Osma Gaiman Avatar\" src=\"//storage.proboards.com/6046952/avatar/I9ct_J9uEe2pAWHGQ4Py.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/55457/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1478190264000\" title=\"Nov 3, 2016 8:24:24 GMT -8\">Nov 3, 2016 8:24:24 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-1823 group-0\" href=\"/user/1823\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@cwashington\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Osma Gaiman</span></a></span> said:</div>Her entourage assembled around her.

By the time they arrived, Osma was shivering and the sun had set.They continued to pretend to dance while murdering another small creature along the way, until Osma Gaiman  stopped them for a quick tutorial. Her water provider scurried away to gather another full pouch of river water. They gathered around her, eyeing her strange hooman movements and noting her word choice.Why did they have to bend at the knee, why not bend at the everything when picking something up? Why not just do it yourself? What if someone steals it while you\u2019re too busy trying to pick it up?!?! None of the ladies particularly got why they had to do this, but tried to follow her guidance. They mastered the \u201cBend\u201d much faster than the \u201cSnap,\u201d but eventually achieved something close enough to what Osma Gaiman  wanted, and were able to continue towards their temporary home with Osma dragging behind by a leash.Nothing much had changed with the camp while they were gone all day, as Osma Gaiman  would be led to the exact same pole she was tied to earlier. However, this time her leash was tethered to the stake, leaving her hands and feet free to breathe. The rope was short, so she had little walking room, but it certainly was an improvement from previously. Out of kindness or some external motive, one of the females she\u2019d been teaching gifted her with an animal fur, presumably to be used as a blanket, clothes, or whatever Osma Gaiman  deemed it.Throughout the whole night, Osma Gaiman  would\u2019ve been able to hear the rough sounds of her pupils making sweet, sweet love in their tents. It seemed their male comrades approved of their appearance change, as they were loving the women harder than they had on any other night. The men showed competition too, some even breaking out into brawls over the best beautiful warrior girls of their legion. Nat'ia had many competitors over whom should be gifted enough to sleep with her over the night.Osma Gaiman \u2019s advice had somewhat worked to a degree, as she made the men flock to each lady because of their beauty and looks, but there was still work to be done in other places, as Osma Gaiman  would soon listen and find out, all through the dark and until the sun started to rise. Perhaps tomorrow she\u2019d need to demonstrate for them how to make copulating with their manly friends a lot pleasanter and quieter\u2026.", "link_list": ["/post/57523/thread", "/user/1823", "/user/1823", "/user/1823", "/user/1823", "/user/1823", "/user/1823", "/user/722", "/user/1823", "/user/1823"], "image_list": ["//storage.proboards.com/6046952/avatar/I9ct_J9uEe2pAWHGQ4Py.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@cwashington\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/57523/thread\" timestamp=\"1480974399\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-1823\" title=\"Osma Gaiman\"><img alt=\"Osma Gaiman Avatar\" src=\"//storage.proboards.com/6046952/avatar/I9ct_J9uEe2pAWHGQ4Py.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/57523/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1480974399000\" title=\"Dec 5, 2016 13:46:39 GMT -8\">Dec 5, 2016 13:46:39 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-1823 group-0\" href=\"/user/1823\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@cwashington\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Osma Gaiman</span></a></span> said:</div><i> Keep a smile.

Would you please kindly? I say if you would wait. No. Stop that! BAD GNOLLS. GO FIND A ROOM OR A HOVEL or something.\" Her words were ignored.

Osma found herself grateful for the nasty fur and grateful for the smoothed stake. She even found herself grateful for the sounds of their uncouth forincations, for it certainly kept other wild beasts away. It also, just might, attract some civilized ones. However much she wanted to tell herself that she had planned for them to all have sex and make lots of noise to alert her rescue ARMY, their sounds were just a byproduct of her trying to make her vanity useful. Didn't matter. She was still going to feel very clever as she slowly circled along her stake (eyes away from the bend and snap happening) as she tried to spy the flash of armor in the darkness.WHERE THE HELL WAS HER RESCUE ARMY? Seriously, did SHE and her medical talents mean nothing to the Warlord Who Was a PRICE BUT Not-A-Prince BUT A PRIncedom thingy called....oh shit....what was the name of that town? \"Mmmm,\" she paused in her searching to think. A something. It started with an A. That she was sure of.While she thought, she grew bored. There was no mirror about or brush in which to do her nightly ritual hair brushing. She was cleaner now than she had been before, but mud was smished between her toes and her torn under dress let in the dewy night chill. Despite the cuts on her body, which were turning to scabs, and the ratty state of her clothes, Osma looked a spirit with the yak fur wafting in the chilled breeze and the moonlight beaming off the juices still lingering on the scabs. She looked like a queen. A queen of the swamp people, but very stately for having a rope tied around her neck. Osma exhaled in relief not long after the gnolls cummed. \"Being held captive is so boring.\" She sighed as she leaned against the stake. The stake leaned a little with her. Her eyes shot to the side. The gnolls that were fucking were returning to a tent where the passion were turning into snores. Osma leaned up, took a hand and gave the stake a wiggle. The ground was wet and that made it loose! HAHAHAH! She would wait for them to be asleep and then she would wiggle it free and slip out of the rope and then run back to that place that started with the letter A and be AWESOME and they would rename that place OSMALAND. It was sure to happen.To test how loose this stake was, Osma began to disguise her push and pull of it as some kind of dance which consisted of her spinning around the pole. The mud was slick and she caught herself before she could fall and choke herself by hooking her thigh on the pole. This exposed her leg in an unladylike fashion and she stood up to fix what there was her garment. But the stake had shifted more. So again she turned, putting her weight into the stake she was turning into a pole. She spun in reverse to unwind the rope and was just about to do another twirl when low and behold she saw the flash of something metal in the nearby distance. She paused, eyes straight at the thing. Hand capping her eyebrows as if the sun where out and shinning. Was it...? Could it be...?

Dimitri  could easily find Osma Gaiman  past the stakes, whom was upon the very outskirts of the circle of tents that surrounded the main campfire. However, due to the nature of the patrols, the time in which Dimitri  had dashed was just before a duo of camp guards would be able to spot him, or at least, something suspicious.The post was thick and ran deep into the ground, making it much harder to retrieve from the earth. As Dimitri  pulled, it did start to loosen but only partially uproot itself, then became stuck again, requiring another great heave. It would've likely been easier just to sever the single thick rope with the cleave of a heavy sword or ax, but it was quite too late right now to change his plan. It would only be a matter of a few seconds before the patrol came about and spotted him. The The Sparrow  and Warlord Shintaro Nishida  would likely remain undetected depending on their action.All other bandit things aside, the encampment's trio of shamans were at work, playing with powerful dark magics that were normally not allowed. Most of the anti-magic totems were missing for this reason, and powerful spellcasters could likely feel the evil presence from the dark spell they were casting in one of the larger, unlit tents.(@mirssa  is still on winter break, and asked me to played their account for now using this one.)While she was certainly not afraid of death, she was quite terrified but enraged that it would seem that Warlord Shintaro Nishida  was preparing to have her dangle from the trees rather than kill her personally or with a weapon.

Magic was something he definetly did not want a part of right now.There was shouting through the camp, someone, or something had been spotted. Patrols from nearby began to hone down and encircle Dimitri   and Osma Gaiman , sneering at them while wielding bows and spears, enough of them to even take down Dimitri . (If he had his heavy armor.) They held fire however, for fear of killing their \"loot\" and bargaining tool. Extra troops began to run out of the camp, roughly two dozen of them all pointed in the direction of the hill and their foes.One went to @mirssa   and cut her binds, then handed her a small axe when they finished. If she wanted revenge, now would be the best time.But before there were any orders given or aggressive actions taken, there were screams and shouts of terror from the camp. Specifically the tent in which the shamans resided, three figures ran outside and scattered: a kiggy, a gnoll, and a goblin all with unique casting tools and magical trinkets. From inside the cloth hut collapsed as a massive creature walked straight through the insignificant barrier...The abomination stood 11 feet tall, and about as wide. It was a combination of mutilated body parts and organs, from humans, kiggys, local widlife, gnolls, and other unknown beasts. It's torso was a swirling blob of flesh, scales and fur, covered in pulsating pustules filled with acidic body fluids that were a as large as a man's head. It appeared this creature had multiple heads, all crudely melded on the beast in multiple locations, the dried out eyes of each being darted around wildly with now control, as if they were all brain dead. The arms were simply the mashed together arms and legs of known beings stretched into giant logs of heavy putrid muscle. It's legs were nothing but short stumps of dirt, wood, limbs and blood mashed together, and it showed no sign of pain from how it was cutting it's soft feet apart. A center hole existed in it's torso, presumably the mouth it used to consume it's unfortunate victims.Some of the bandits turned, not making a move or a sound for the fear of it seeing them. After tearing down the building it was born in, the demonic figure began to slowly lumber towards the hill, it's true side unknown, the little bandits sure to stay out of it's way. In the rear, Nat'ia  was quietly trying to organize the troops and begin forming ranks to open fire on it. The night was silent as all the dirty creatures stopped and cowered before the flesh monster, the only sounds were of the raging fire in the camp, whispering of the bandits in a brutish tongue, and the thumping of the abomination's slow walk on the ground...", "link_list": ["/post/59606/thread", "/user/1237", "/user/1237", "/user/1823", "/user/1237", "/user/722"], "image_list": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0h8iN84az5o/U81_WCdMhiI/AAAAAAAAEb8/ucmRbxUI3FM/s1600/9630088_orig.jpg", "http://i.imgur.com/gy1kX4m.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@dimitri\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/59606/thread\" timestamp=\"1485265460\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-1237\" title=\"Dimitri\"><img alt=\"Dimitri Avatar\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0h8iN84az5o/U81_WCdMhiI/AAAAAAAAEb8/ucmRbxUI3FM/s1600/9630088_orig.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/59606/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1485265460000\" title=\"Jan 24, 2017 5:44:20 GMT -8\">Jan 24, 2017 5:44:20 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-1237 group-0\" href=\"/user/1237\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@dimitri\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Dimitri</span></a></span> said:</div>Dimitri raises an eyebrow in a quizzical manner towards Osma.

This of course, exposed her to arrows.The ugly creature, well into its charge, took the thrown pole right into where Dimitri had aimed. It didn\u2019t stop it, nor really deviate its course, only had seemingly stunned it for a second. Everyone was able to get out of it\u2019s way in time, and so it ran by them before it tried stopping itself and turning around towards. It showed signs of damage, but nothing of dieing or yielding. The area where Dimitri had hit resulted in putting its main eye out, splinters grotesquely scattered in the eye and the flesh around it. Blood and liquid green fluid poured like a fountain, but it seemed as if this thing did not even care. It either ignored Warlord Shintaro Nishida and Osma Gaiman, or just didn\u2019t see them run away, because it now readied itself against the lycan. Similar to its charge, but slower and more controlled, it marched forward on it\u2019s two raw meat legs, but swang and flailed its massive arms and tentacles out infront of itself, strong enough to easily crush any of the foes present, even Dimitri. He\u2019d have to get out of the way, or stop the abomination from attacking if he didn\u2019t want to get pulverized.Meanwhile, there was also a line of Hunting Legion spearmen amassing behind Dimitri, but they kept their range if he tried attacking them.It almost seemed that Warlord Shintaro Nishida and Osma Gaiman were in the clear, if the bandits weren\u2019t shooting at them. Arrows whizzed by, and even with their steed, evading all of them was impossible. Either Disco or Warlord Shintaro Nishida would likely be struck. It also seemed that some few bandits were closing in around their direct escape in the forest, if they dared try and jump over or through them, they\u2019d be impaled by multiple crude spears. It wasn\u2019t a good way to die, but certainly better than whatever the hell that other thing was.((Screw the dice thing then. Dang newbies.
