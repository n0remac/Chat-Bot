She continued to dance, whirling her alight fan around and around on her finger as her nimble feet continued to carry her back and forth, miming how the ancient priestesses had defending their village, a second fan in hand that suddenly blazed alight as another burst of fire poured from Miyuri's mouth.\"Away, away from my mothers, the priestesses of Katsunaga that defended their village with the power of the ancient spirits. Away, away the oni ran until--\"she snapped her fans shut, and the fire immediately doused upon their ends, smoke curling up from its edges. \"There was only darkness.\"And when Miyuri bowed, it was to much applaused, the chime of coins pinging off the ground at her feet as the crowd tipped her.
