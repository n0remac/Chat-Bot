Katashima-no-Kami-Genji, daimyo of the local domain and Queen Itami's right hand man, was one of six samurai who sat in seiza upon their knees, three to each side of the room, forming a lane through which Daisuke passed. Nowhere did the exalted Queen of Katashima go without rigorous guards at her disposal.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He appeared incognito sitting with the other samurai, none of whom possessed the same level of political prestige as Genji, but all of whom wore the kimono, hakama, the daisho sword set of katana and wakizashi held before their left hips by the obi, and decorative haori overcoats.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Genji had been watching Itami very closely. Her chief adviser, he felt personally responsible for her, especially as she was quite young and naive for her station. Statuesque in his position, his eyes nonetheless flickered from Itami to her visitor, and fixated on the man as his head snapped up from his bow.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This was the first sign. That the visitor's eyes should leave the floor upon which they should be fixed precluded Genji's nightmare scenario. The grin, his words, the motion he made to reach for his knife... all of these presented sufficient time for Genji's instincts to culminate into the right response, which given the technique and its years of conditioning, would appear in what seemed to be a blink of an eye.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0His left hand had sneakily taken hold of the upper lip of the katana's sheath--the koiguchi--his right taking the blade's tightly wrapped\u00a0tsuka in tandem. With this motion, his left thumb pressed against the brass\u00a0tsuba hand guard, freeing the sword from its lacquered scabbard. The left arm drew that scabbard back along Genji's sash, pulling the sheath from the sword in the same coordinated motion as his right arm's draw. The man's legs, which moved without so much as a foreshadowing twitch had now elevated him up from seiza and forward upon his left knee, coordinated with the already well-synchronized set of motions that bespoke an astounding union between the man and his blade.The result? Literally as quickly as Daisuke could look upwards, smile, speak, and reach for his boot, a long blade, expertly forged and razor sharpened, flicked across the remaining distance between their two bodies, slated to bite deeply into his right side without a millisecond's mercy. The force and the sharpness of the blade involved insured that the following cut would be fatal.\u00a0 \u00a0 \"AAIIIIII!!!!!\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>"}, "post-2665": {"user": "Odd looking Medan ambassador", "user_num": 194, "timestamp": "1431801242000", "message": "Dai Suki's side opened and the assassin dropped his knife before it reached the empress.

As her loyal teacher and vassal, he felt somewhat personally responsible for what had occurred. He had presented the queen what he thought to be invaluable advice, and it was not heeded.
