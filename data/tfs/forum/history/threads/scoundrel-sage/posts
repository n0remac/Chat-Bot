As a result of this, obscene amounts of smuggled alcohol, and the merriest of jigs, it can often get a little rowdy in there.\u00a0The proprietor does his best to manage. He is a short and fat old man with graying hair who claims to be a retired pirate. Sometimes he tells stories of his past adventures, in which he is always the main protagonist.
