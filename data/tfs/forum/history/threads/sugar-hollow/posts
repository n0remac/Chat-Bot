Osma thought as she arrived by stage in the land of Sugar Hollow. The ad in the gossip scroll she had read talked about a fantasyland of cotton candy trees and milk chocolate rivers. Green apple sugar straws were said to make up the grass and the buildings were of recently baked gingerbread. What she had discovered as she stuck her head out the window the moment they entered Gumdrop Valley, was regular blades of grass and dumb old trees with stupid old leaves.Just like every other place!\"Why does nothing exciting ever happen to me?\" She complained, to which her stagecoach companions rolled their eyes.She blamed the penny papers entirely for this. They were so filled with rumors about all the famous people of the lands that it should not have been a surprise that it was wrong about this place too. With a look of utter disappointed, she glanced out the window. Hiyama was there, face wrapped in a blue cloth.  Even the locals are so ashamed that they hide their faces.  Her eyes moved over the plump man. At least he was a bit more interesting. \"I wonder if...\" she began to speak to the companions, but shut up when she realized that they had all gone! They could not leave the coach fast enough. How rude it was to leave her behind! Perhaps she should just ride back to the portal. Though, it had been a long ride though and could use a spot of proper tea.They better have some PROPER tea or the whole town would be fit only to BURN TO THE GROUND. A spark light her eyes at the thought. Entirely on her own, Osma was force to help herself down from the coach. Her overnight bag was flung from the rooftop to the street. \"HOW DARE YOU SIR!\" she shouted at the driver to which he replied, \"Oh I do dare.\" He grumbled something about a bossy hefer before flicking the reins and heading the coach away from Osma. Osma gasped and stepped from the sidewalk and into the street. \"I got your coach number, I'll have you know. I WILL REPORT YOU!\" she called after him. He did not stop, nor turn back. With a huff, she slide her eyes to the side. People were watching. Opps.With a blush she smiled an award-winning, fall-to-your-knees-and-beg-for-love smile. \"Such a charming town you have.\" ", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<i> Well this was a disappointment. </i>"}, "post-58909": {"user": "Hiyama", "user_num": 192, "timestamp": "1483246244000", "message": "Dec 30, 2016 21:04:26 GMT -8 Royal Fletcher said:As Hiyama strolled through the village, he would attract quite a bit of attention from the townsfolk.

Past that are the western cherry fields, and those are run by Supervisor Ballet.\"A man shuffled hesitantly up to the supervisor, carrying a basket of juicy-looking cherries.\"S-supervisor Waltz? There is a blight on the trees in rows 17 through 19. We're losing trees fast and are worried that it might spread.\"Supervisor Waltz looked down at the nervous man in annoyance.\"Have all the trees in rows 17 through 19 cut down and burned. I want them removed and replaced with saplings by tomorrow, you understand?\"The nervous man nodded, and scurried off.", "link_list": ["/post/58942/thread", "/user/2042"], "image_list": ["https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/3a/3d/4d/3a3d4de06db30bdd738940a578bd69f1.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@happy\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/58942/thread\" timestamp=\"1483301939\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-2042\" title=\"High Priest Yori\"><img alt=\"High Priest Yori Avatar\" src=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/3a/3d/4d/3a3d4de06db30bdd738940a578bd69f1.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/58942/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1483301939000\" title=\"Jan 1, 2017 12:18:59 GMT -8\">Jan 1, 2017 12:18:59 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-2042 group-0\" href=\"/user/2042\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@happy\"><span itemprop=\"name\">High Priest Yori</span></a></span> said:</div><i>Just over that hill.</i>The priest told himself as he labored across the surrounding planes, attempting to travel beneath the shade of the trees when permitted. The  priest had been walking  less than an hour and the physical strain had already began to take its toll upon him. Though he did not know a village was there his expanded sense  could pick up on the various form of life which had gathered there.<i> A small  town.</i> Yori was a slight anemic man and it was obvious that the male was unaccustomed to physical exertion. Yet, he did not let it show, should anyone  look upon the male  they would see a man who projected a regal atmosphere. Longs strands of white  hair spilled across his shoulders in subtle waves- tied  with tiny gold-bells that jingled as he walked. The  male was clad in a white  kimono which appeared almost ceremonial, black  patterns  stitched into the fabric, draped over black underclothing- glimpses  of which could be seen through the slits of the upper  arms.  A thin cloth had  been draped over his  face  with four  painted  eyes  over the flat surface allowing him to gaze outward  while  covering the double-pupils beneath.<br><br/>Upon his  right hip dangled a sword, yet the blade was  short  nearly two feet in length, rectangular and flat on all edges  with various runes inscribed across the surface. Obviously meant for protection than anything  else. Within his left hand he carried a staff, a strange non-descript emblem settled on top, golden  circlets chimed a dull unceremonious tone  as he leaned upon the staff  using it to support  his weight, while  incense burned  from the top causing a ring of smoke to encircle the  priest, yet the  wisps  of smoke seemed to bend around the male as if he were wreathed in some un-seen barrier. <br/> <br/>The High Priest, had not permitted his attendants to accompany  him on his quest which in hindsight seemed like a very poor decision on Yori\u2019s  behalf- having known his own physical limitations. He eyed  the hill, contemplating simply jumping the remaining distance. <b><font color=\"#a19c00\">\u201dTo suffer is to service of our faith.\u201d</font></b> and so he walked the remaining distance, puffing by the time he arrived at the summit. It was not long  now until the male arrived at the town. <br/><div class=\"quote_clear\"></div></br></div></div>"}, "post-58945": {"user": "Osma Gaiman", "user_num": 1823, "timestamp": "1483304052000", "message": "She wanted to smile at the telling of the drunk journalist.

However...I do have an extensive tea collection at my home. I'd like to invite you'd over, if that's alright with you. You seem to be a woman of high standing, after all. And besides, there's nowhere else in town to get some of the teas that I have. I'm sure you'd enjoy it.\"The townsfolk glanced at each other nervously.

He hadn't seen magic before, and wasn't quite sure. It certainly looked like magic. There weren't any mages or anything of the sort in town. There had been an alchemist's shop, run by his sister and her husband, but it had exploded fifteen or sixteen years ago, killing them both. It had been a huge tragedy in such a small town, and their little boy had been sent away to live with his grandmother. Waltz occasionally wondered what ever happened to his nephew, but really had no way of knowing. News was hard to come by, and it had been years since he'd been sent off. Sighing, Waltz shook his head and put the boy out of his mind and continued watching Yori's magic. He gasped as the black mist was drawn from the plants and was sucked into the gourd. Was that the blight? Once Yori finished, Waltz ran over to the trees. They were clean and healthy, and very clearly blight-free. The cherries were still small, but he had no doubt that they'd grow to a proper size in time. Walking over to the skinny priest, he helped the man to his feet.\"Wow...that's very impressive! I can't believe you actually did that. Is the blight in your bottle right now? What if it leaks?\"Easily lifting the skinny priest, Waltz helped him up onto the horse.

A nod was given as he  followed the male towards the trees, stopping once their arrived at the designated location. Feet carried the male towards the  first tree as he looked it over, noting the affect of the <b>blight</b> which  had plagued them. <i>So many.</i>  would he really  be able to save them? The male appeared confident in his abilities at least. A single  hand extended to touch the bark of the tree. Head inclining as his gaze fell upon the  branches noting the shriveled berries that still clung to the trees and those that littered the ground. Burning the  trees was the correct course, should the villagers have found themselves  absent  one priest. Slowly  he turned back to Waltz. <br/><br/><b><font color=\"#8d9a00\">\u201dI seek no reward, Sir. Service to the faith is payment enough, though I will be most humbled if you could provide me a place to stay for the night and perhaps a meal. Servants of the faith are not permitted coin and must rely on the kindness of strangers in order to fulfill their quest.\u201d</font></b> he turned back towards the tree at hand  before taking a step back. Digits lightly clutching the staff which he held. <i>How  many lives shall be spared this day?<br/><br/></i><br/>A strange gust absent before  seemed to swirl about them, tugging lightly at the Priet\u2019s robes, causing those bells to  toil once more. Slowly  he lifted  the staff  above  his head once he found a suitable  spot, the work would be tedious, he knew. Since his spear  of influence  had been a contracted mass around  his person and expanding it to cover such a wide area  would be difficult indeed . Smoke wreathed about his form as he waved the  staff  back  and forth causing those  metal circlets to chime  softly. White  locks  of hair began to lift off the male\u2019s shoulders like tiny white snakes \u2013 his fourth-sight  expanding to  encompass the entire  area. It was subtle at first, though it was clear that the male  contained an immense amount of spiritual as befitting of a high-priests, a faint golden orb  surrounded the diameter  roughly the  length  of the staff he wielded. Finally the staff  was  lowered to touch the earth,  then lifted again  in its place a phantom stood. A golden rod, transparent  and glowing brightly. The male walked down the  row, setting the staff  down once more. Then down the column for however long it took to do the  same on the  other side forming a box around the entire  affected area. <br/><br/>Eyes  quivered  as his sights were  expanded\u2014beyond that of what a normal human was capable.  The entire are was  glowing  then as if alight in a bright golden flame  though  none  of the branches  were burned and the  light gave off no heat. Those standing close enough would feel a faint  warmth  that was somehow comforting.  And providing all went accordingly; the sickness would be separated from the trees at a molecular  level, drawn  from the trees,  fruits, and the earth. A <b>blight </b> upon the very air resembled a black mist as it was drawn towards the priests. A gourd at Yori\u2019s hip uncorked itself  and the <b>blight </b>was channeled into the vessel like a stream flowing into the mouth of a river before finally nothing remained.. and the spiritual pressure which could be felt  faded. <br/><br/>The high-priests could be seen sitting upon his knees where he had concluded his work. Obviously in need of rest, though it was not the spiritual-exhaustion that taxed him. Having  walked to the city then the length of the orchid  left the anemic male quite  weary. <br/><div class=\"quote_clear\"></div></br></div></div>"}, "post-58963": {"user": "Royal Fletcher", "user_num": 323, "timestamp": "1483317856000", "message": "Jan 1, 2017 15:35:00 GMT -8 Hiyama said:\"Thank you very much.\" He nods in respect, glancing in the direction he spoke of.

The blade had been held just before his left hip by a wide black sash, and he slid the sword from his side and placed both it and the cloak to lean upon the bar just at the foot of his stool.\u00a0 \u00a0 \"Thank you for your hospitality.\"", "link_list": ["/post/58963/thread", "/user/323", "/post/58961/thread", "/user/192", "/user/192"], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/2gWrqrd.png", "http://i.imgur.com/xSLDax2.png"], "html": "<div author=\"@royalfletcher\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/58963/thread\" timestamp=\"1483317856\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-323\" title=\"Royal Fletcher\"><img alt=\"Royal Fletcher Avatar\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2gWrqrd.png\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/58963/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1483317856000\" title=\"Jan 1, 2017 16:44:16 GMT -8\">Jan 1, 2017 16:44:16 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-323 group-0\" href=\"/user/323\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@royalfletcher\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Royal Fletcher</span></a></span> said:</div><div author=\"@hiyama\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/58961/thread\" timestamp=\"1483313700\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-192\" title=\"Hiyama\"><img alt=\"Hiyama Avatar\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/xSLDax2.png\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/58961/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1483313700000\" title=\"Jan 1, 2017 15:35:00 GMT -8\">Jan 1, 2017 15:35:00 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-192 group-0\" href=\"/user/192\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@hiyama\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Hiyama</span></a></span> said:</div>\"Thank you very much.\" He nods in respect, glancing in the direction he spoke of.

Do they teach you how to read fortunes from tea in your order, or is it something you picked up on your own?\"The thought of Yori associated with a bunch of old crones brought \u00a0a faint laugh to his lips though he shook his head slowly. \"It's more of an old saying. You don't need to be a soothsayer in order to see that.\" he looked down at his \u00a0own cup noting the stock which still stood vertically even as he sipped lightly at his own tea.\u00a0There were a few within the order that possessed the gift of sight, though those were the bishops and such and usually never left their golden city. He pondered \u00a0a moment before finally finishing of the rest of his tea, and setting his empty cup upon the coffee table. \"Knowing ones fate can be quite the burden.\" he concluded. It was both a blessing and a curse, and in the wrong hands could be use for terrible things.

There were turrets, steeples, and stained-glass windows. To approach the mansion, the pair walked through a blooming garden full of colorful, exotic flowers.

One ran off to notify Ms. Suiker, and another walked up to the guests with a very clearly fake smile on her face.\"Hello there, Supervisor Waltz. Newcomer. Welcome to Ms. Suiker's mansion. What can I do for you?\"The High Priest  listened as Waltz explained  Suiker\u2019s role within the community attempting to get a better image of her. Eyes slid shut, head tipping towards the sun allowing golden hues to play off of his white hair. Yet he already had an idea of what sort of woman the Lady might have been. Opulent. He took a faint breath  before expelling it in a single puff of air which ruffled the cloth  slightly covering his face. Lids  slit  open reveling  those twin pupils with a renewed focus. Pling,  the soft metallic chime resonated faintly as the butt of the staff struck against the ground causing those golden circlets to clang  together- a single trail of gray smoke began to rise from the small incense chassis like a snake  wriggling trough the air, lightly curling around the priests in thin coils.  She was not the only one with a sense of grandeur.   So he needed to look presentable before they arrived, subtle movements, hair appeared less disheveled than Waltz might have remembered it in the dim lighting of the cabin and his robes were free of dust.   He continued behind the man at a steady pace, shallow breaths  touching his lips by the time that they had reached the mansion, though if the walk had tired  the Priest he did not let it show. Golden hues slowly scanned  the gardeners and workers  who tended the gardens as they approached the gate before finally they were allowed onto the premises. Not that they were met with much resistance, it seemed that Waltz was quite familiar with the land as well.He slowed to a halt as they were greeted by a female, eyes meeting her own through the thin cloth. \u201cMy name is Yori, High Priest of the Order, please  inform the lady that we have brought a gift and would be honored if she would share in it.\u201d Tendrils of smoke tentatively reached out as if to claw at the priest\u2019s clothing yet curled away as if there was some sort of filed  around  his person. The pouch at his side unlaced itself though rather than fall to the ground it hovered  there as if by some imperceptible string, being lifted on its own and extended towards her.", "link_list": ["/post/59568/thread", "/user/323", "/user/2042"], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/2gWrqrd.png"], "html": "<div author=\"@royalfletcher\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/59568/thread\" timestamp=\"1485147529\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-323\" title=\"Royal Fletcher\"><img alt=\"Royal Fletcher Avatar\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2gWrqrd.png\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/59568/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1485147529000\" title=\"Jan 22, 2017 20:58:49 GMT -8\">Jan 22, 2017 20:58:49 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-323 group-0\" href=\"/user/323\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@royalfletcher\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Royal Fletcher</span></a></span> said:</div>Once they were ready, Waltz led <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-2042 group-0\" href=\"/user/2042\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@happy\"><span itemprop=\"name\">High Priest Yori</span></a></span>  out the door.

Hundreds of years ago, when Sugar Hollow was just a single farmstead, it was owned by Paul and Polly Parfait, and their little son Poll. Every now and then, bandits would come by and collect 'taxes', and they would have to hide all their valuables. Y'see, the bandits took the 'taxes' based on what Paul and Polly had. So whenever they heard bandits coming over the mountains, they would hide everything worth anything in the well. It worked for years and years, until one day a new bandit crew came through. The Parfaits hid everything in the well as usual, and got ready to pay their 'taxes'. However, these new bandits didn't want the gold, they were after something much more valuable: the farm. They killed Paul and Polly, and took over the whole place. These bandits, the Suiker clan, built it into a whole town, and rule to this day. Nobody believes that they used to be murderous villains, but they were. However, because they killed the two so quickly, they never learned about the treasure in the hidden well. Little Poll escaped, though. He ran off and never returned. He did, however, draw up this map and passed it on to his kids, so that they could return when it was safe. It was passed down through the generations for decades until I...acquired it. I'd go look for it myself, but I took an arrow to the knee and haven't been up for adventuring ever since. However, I am willing to help you find it. You seem like a dependable young lad. The only thing is...it's a bit of a trek, and I can't walk there. However, if you advance me five gold pieces, I can get a horse. With a horse, I can lead you as far as it'll take me, and then you can go the rest of the way and bring back the treasure. I've got the map, all I need is someone who can go and get it. So, how's it sound? Will you help me?

However, if they lagged behind, Appopo and Wah would notice little black spots on the walls and pavement where the fluff balls touched. It looked almost like ink, or possibly charcoal, and would make the squeakers easy to track. Eventually, they would spot the odd little puff balls hop into an open window of a candy shop. Squeaking and banging came from within, as well as the shouting of a shopkeeper and the unmistakable sound of a broom being swung at small creatures. A few moments later, the squeakers came back out, each carrying a single piece of brightly wrapped candy over their heads.

His other hand had black energy spewing from it, placing a dome around the entire piece of land as yellow lights shown from the ground, forming two demonic runes; one for good and one for evil. A ring the width of the dome wrapped around these two symbols. Using his left hand, Appopo reached into the belly of his coat and dug around a minute. A few clunks and clinks, screams and laughs, and other weird noises, Appopo pulled out some candy and threw it in the evil circle and candy in the light circle. He'd then throw the lolipop from earlier into the circle. The lights would glow and then vanish, taking done with it.Appopo looked at what was in front of him and scratched where his nose would be if he had one. His head tilted back and forth, staring at the grass.\"Po da fopop?\" It seemed like even Appopo was confused.And then a black block appeared in the middle, accompanied by more with every second. A white picket fence started popping out of the ground and so did white chickens. Next was a mailbox at the gate. Appopo crossed his arms and started tapping his right foot on the ground, faster and faster till it was in the ground and then he'd just move it and continue. His eyes slanted and a vein started bulging above his right eye.\"Pamip po pololo!\" He shouted at the slow process. A small sticky note appeared on Appopos forehead, \"Rock-Candy!\"Appopo scribbled a \"me pu!\" And stuck it back on his forehead. Another appeared, \"You're the Father of Destruction. Get us our damn Rock Candy. We don't care what you want.\"Appopo just looked at it and blinked with a sweat drop forming on his forehead. A new message appeared telling Appopo to flip the note over. When he flipped it over, a large tongue stuck out and gave him a raspberry (not the berry). Appopos face was covered in slobber and he blew the note up. While wiping his face off,  he had another note appear. He'd sigh, drop his head, and look at it. Another tongue, another face full of slobber. This time Appopo grabbed the tongue, wiped away the slobber, lowered his cloths and revealed his mouth. The tongue flickering went to spurts and what looked like an attempt to flee. Appopo ate it and no more stickynotes showed up. Appopo then looked at the work, muttered some words, and waved his wand. It all sped up to reveal a small two story tower. Chickens clucked and bees were buzzing, and Appopo walked through the small white picket gate. He stopped at a plant that had smiley faces for flowers and poked one; a blood curdling scream was heard as long as he touched it. He'd giggle and play with the screaming a flowers to make music out of it. He then walked into his keep, shut the wooden door behind him, and looked around. It was massive in the inside, like an entire mansion. Besides a few pillars for structure support, the wooden floors were dusty and so was the wood chair in the far right corner. The spell took a lot out of him, because what everyone saw was not the only thing created. Up in the clouds, a wizard tower floated in the sky. We won't talk much on it now, but it's there. Appopo curled up on the ground and passed out. His snores filled the air quickly as well as floating z's made of a black energy. They'd vanish into thin air at first, but then the space started filling in with furniture and other nice things, as well as stairs and the second floor. While Appopo napped in his new home, Nimpapa and Nimpopo searched high and low for the guy in the picture.

Anti-magic, he deduced.\u00a0 In a wild, unexpected turn, a dragon appeared in the area, Lum'Valia .\u00a0 She took Tandor by surprise, and he raised his weapon threateningly, but it would seem she was on their side.Tandor was relieved; there was very little stopping Lum'Valia from reaching over and chomping him in two.\u00a0 \"Er, yeah, corral them away, I agree,\" he said, still startled by her appearance.Tandor heard the cacophony of more dragon wings as Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui    and Trogdor    came into the scene; looking up he observed their figures.

He hoped that he would not have to hurt them as well, but the smoke billowing from one and the anti-magic derived from the other told him otherwise.\u00a0 Five\u00a0 dragons in one day, Tandor thought to himself.
