Many of those that had sustained injuries but continued to draw breath had been moved to New Solaria after receiving medical aid from the various factions within the Free City, Marcus included. The left of his face had been badly burnt and as such was an ever constant reminder of his failure to his people leaving his horribly disfigured. His armour had managed to cushion most of the damage to his side with only a tight bandage around his abdomen remaining. \u00a0Since the horror Marcus had spent most of his time recovering in the solitude of his makeshift lean-to. He was beginning to regain his strength thanks to some uneasy rest and some magical healing from his new allies, or so they would claim to be. This letter he had received was unsettling especially since he was in no condition to defend himself or his people. There was only one person, aside from his kinsmen, who he thought he could trust.\u00a0He mustered his strength to call out to those who were tending to him \"Send word to\u00a0Ildesias.
