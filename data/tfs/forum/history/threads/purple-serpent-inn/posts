This process normally starts having effects after twenty hours.At first it starts like an upset stomach that may be acquainted by throwing up or diarrhea. The next effect is what feels like the'ye being stabbed in their gut thousands of times. The last thing anyone feels in the worms inside them eating them alive. It was a horrific and painful ending that takes less that one hour to kill. \"I'd like to rent a room. I am a Candy Aficionado and I have candies in all the lands! I'm here for business! Take what coins you need for payment and please, help yourself to one of these Gummy Worms. They were made fresh this morning!
