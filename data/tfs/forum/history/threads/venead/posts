He was suddenly reminded of the ape-man, who seemed highly displeased and rather angry that the battle had been fought so close to the tribe's home. \"Although.. I may see a way to make this proposed venture worthwhile. There is a tribe of apemen near those mines whose displeasure may one day turn sour enough to form open rebellion. Though I am less interested in the mines themselves, my men have begun to fortify the wall of snow and ice that covered the pass outside during the battle. This means, of course, that should the apemen turn rebellious, they will be in a prime position to hit this fortification from the rear and possibly even route the garrison. Make no mistake that should this happen, the route through which the enemy first entered these mountains would be open again to their incursions.\"\"So this is my counter-proposal: I will give you the men you require. In return, I would like you to calm the apemen and keep their leader satisfied. If this proves impossible, then destroy them.

It ended in victory for our forces, but now many of our people; our elderly, our women; live in fear that they will return. In addition to this, they took prisoners of our great Volkrim commander, Owa, and possibly more if they did not fall beneath the snows.

More worrying, however, is that this horribly violent kidnapping took place on the lands given to my children to be their safe haven against all that is wrong.
