As the place got dimmer, she was able to see better, and she nodded at Typhus -- her head wobbling with the weight of her hair -- and then was enclosed in the room with only a lantern to \"see\" by. But she could see perfectly well! And she gasped at the clothes as she picked them up. So pretty! They were some of the prettiest things she'd ever seen (when in actuality, they were quite plain, only decorated with very minor feminine touches, or not decorated at all and simply cut for a feminine body). She struggled out of the large clothing she was wearing, her pants a bit of an issue given that her new boots were on and it was hard to pull her feet out of them. The pants wound up ripping, actually, sooo... Typhus was going to have to buy one of these skirts regardless. Ollie whined and scratched at the door where she was as she shuffled around, bumps and \"oofs!\" and scrapes coming from inside the room as the ignorant girl struggled to get herself put together.Then she burst from the dressing room, and the transformation was almost perfect. She'd taken the scarf from her hair because, let's face it, that was never going to last, and she'd ripped the scarf into a ribbon that held her long, midnight blue hair up in a ponytail, so only the very tippy-tip ends brushed the floor. She wore a feminine blouse that was snug to her body, with puff should sleeves that she absolutely adored. A belt was around her waist, accenting its narrowness and helping to keep the pink-to-purple skirt she was wearing that was shorter on one side, either by purpose design or shoddy workmanship. It showed off an inch of her lower thigh and her trim knee, but most of all, it showed off the boots Typhus had already bought for her.\"Typhus!\" She called his name happily, and she spun around, her enthusiasm and happiness infections and making Ollie bounce around her as well, letting out two short and happy barks. It made Seren laugh again, and she bent to ruffle Ollie's ears before she rushed to Typhus and held his hands. In the back of the shop, she had a little more sight, and one could see that SHE could see better just by looking at her swirling purple eyes where more of a darkened pupil was at its center. \"So pretty!
