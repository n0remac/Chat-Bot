Her visual acuity was above average for a human and she could tell when they were getting within visual range of the ogres.Leaving behind Indigo and Blackbean (in case they needed a quick getaway), the party would sneak closer towards the tower, bunny-hopping from trees to rocky outcroppings, getting as close as they dared.

She wanted to make sure their plan would work. She noted the position of the sun and any other sources of cover. \"Ok... on my signal.\"Ying-Na nodded and aimed her longbow at one of the ogres on the closest side tower to them. She pulled back as far as she dared, her shoulder muscles straining. The Katashiman bow had an eighty pound draw weight and could break the back of less experienced archers. As she pulled back on it, she fondly remembered how many months it took her to get good with it, and how many hours she spent practicing with it this year. It nearly deformed her shoulder to do so. The arrow would strike at about 90 meters per second. It would hit like thunder bolt (armor piercing, incredible force) and be virtually impossible to dodge, and it was trained right on the ogre's neck.Jun had built up enough mana to create two light constructs. However, rather than just create them, she focused her mind on another source of cover, a rocky outcropping, about a dozen meters away.\"Bel, nahl kun.\" Two strange, glittering white objects appeared, one hidden behind the outcropping, and the other high in the sky above them. The hidden construct was a gem-shaped, hexagonal plate with sharp edges. It was about twice as tall as a full-grown man, half as wide, and a foot thick. She designed it with maximum strength and minimum mana cost in mind. The second object was a perfectly smooth, glossy orb with a curved protrusion, tapering into a point as small as a sowing needle.Jun focused more on the sharp object. She had summoned it in the same direction as the sun, so the glare would make the object invisible to the ogres.\"Resonance, I want you to, very carefully, start drawing on my mana. Stop when you have 20% of the total.\" The sword would obey and begin to glow slightly. In Jun's eyes a fairy was floating about, gathering up strands of a translucent blue substance from her chest.Now that everything was ready, Jun began to count down. \"Me and mom will take out as many as we can before they see us. On the count of three... one... two... three!\"Ying-Na let loose her arrow. At the same time Jun narrowed her eyes and flung her hand forward. The sharp object careened towards the second ogre on the guard tower with speed matching the arrow. It was also aimed at the ogre's neck.

This was to further protect Doobie from what was coming. \"Fire Art: Resonance Coronal Shockwave!\" The sword's brilliance erupted into a blinding flash. Expending all the mana Jun had given it, the sword released a torrent of fire energy and concussive force which would shake the entire battlefield. The sound alone would be enough to stun some of the nearby ogres. Any ogres caught in the blast would take massive damage or be killed outright.\"Doobie, have your stand take Resonance!\" Jun cried out as she drew the construct away from Doobie, leaving his stand free to wield the powerful weapon.The excessive heat energy from the Coronal Shockwave would also form thin trails, which would gather around Jun's head...***Having to deal with so many things at once, Ying-Na saw that her daughter was being strained to her absolute limits. To have to control two light constructs, help Doobie, and create a fire absorption ward all at once meant that Jun wouldn't be able to deflect the incoming magic arrow. Although Ying-Na didn't have specialized training from a holy dragon, she did have decades of experience. She quickly processed the fact that Vaelar's men were in trouble, Jun was pushed to the very limits of her concentration already, and thus she would have to dodge the magic green arrow herself. The spaces in between her heart beats felt like an eternity as she focused on the ogre archer. Intimately aware of an archer's stance and sense of timing, she carefully read the ogre's body language. Not yet, not yet, NOW! At the last possible second, Ying-Na cinched her quiver, tossed her bow, and then, just as the arrow set sail, leaped to the side, in the direction of Jun. She figured this was a safer place to be as Jun's light constructs would protect them both. She was relieved as the arrow exploded in a burst next to her.Having switched to her shortbow, Ying-Na would be unable to fire at the archer. But she could still help out Vaelar's men. She quickly un-cinched her quiver, pulled out another handful of arrows, fanned them in her hand, and let loose another barrage of rapid fire arrows towards the ogres.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "As Jun gained a sense of the battlefield, her instincts as a commander were beginning to kick in.
