It was more then big enough for her, bigger then the room she had owned in the Okiya and the view was beautiful. Within the first week of her stay she had created a space for herself that she felt comfortable in. It always smelled of rich scented teas and flowers. In the evenings candles would be lit in the room and Nakatani would be found sitting in the middle of the room with tea, anybody free to join her as she always brewed a full pot. She had a nightstand with all the gifts she had received from her patrons during her period as a Geisha, and even all her Geisha make-up was still in her own possession. The only thing she had never owned was her own silk Kimono. A normal man would have to work a lifetime to afford one of those beautiful robes, and all the kimono's she had ever worn were the possession of the Okiya. She lived her days as a servant in the mansion. She felt more comfortable helping out around the mansion then sitting in her own room the whole day. She would wait to see what Genji-sama would require of her and when he would require it off her.

She opened up the sliding door that let to the balcony and rested there, watching the view that was in front of her. After meeting Isao and having the conversations with him that she had, she began to understand how lost she felt. She didn't understand what her purpose was, what she was meant to do. She had been ripped away from the life she had led and even though it might not have been her choice to become a Geisha. She had started to enjoy it. It had taught her many things, things she couldn't just put beside her. And now she was here, in the mansion of one of the most powerful man in the country who required something of her that she didn't even knew. She shook her head trying to forget everything that was floating around in her head and got up from the place she was sitting. She opened one of the cabinets that were reserved for her Geisha stuff and took out a wooden box made of beautiful wood with carvings all over it. As she opened it she took out a bamboo flute, her Shakuhachi. She sat down at the balcony once again and started to play a calm tune that she had often played before when entertaining man, but it always calmed her down. Her mind began to wander in the tunes she was playing as the music echoed through the outside air to float anywhere where it wanted to be heard.

She had a good night sleep and she stretched herself out. She folded herself in a morning kimono and started to fold up her futons and put them away. For the first time that week Nakatani took more time to prepare herself for the day. She took out a simple kimono that was a bit more luxurious then the servant ropes she had been wearing and tied up her hair in a simple, yet elegant bun. As the servants noticed she had awoken they came in and offered her her breakfast and for the first time she would accept it instead of making it herself later. Before she would have felt bad, but after yesterday she figured it wouldn't be that bad to accept a bit more relaxation and luxury while she was here. After she had finished her morning rituals she got up and went inside the garden for a stroll. The flowers were blooming beautifully and Nakatani found herself pausing at every single one of them. When she reached Amaririsu, she plucked a few from them their stem and held them close to her. \"Isao would enjoy these.\" she whispered to herself.

The red blush was still fresh on her cheeks and looking at herself in the mirror she couldn't understand what was happening to her. Never in her life she had felt this nervous around men, and she had been around them a lot and often. As she calmed herself down with a glass of water she started to prepare herself for the afternoon. She redid her hair, making sure every strand was in place and sprayed herself with sweet and rich scented parfumes. Unsure of which one would be to Isao's liking, she put on her own personal favorite. Which was a Sakura inspired scent.

But both of them seemed clueless or simply did not want to admit to having any feelings for the other. It would be a long time before either of them would be ready to express their feelings towards the other. Suddenly a smile appeared on Kazue's face and a giggle could be heard again. Her appearance suddenly changed into that of a young samurai, into that of Isao and she walked towards the sleeping girl, sitting down in front of her. Gently she shook the girl her shoulders and she woke up. Her eyes immediately wide open as she did not expect what she was seeing in front of her.
