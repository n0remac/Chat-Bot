The rest of The Depravity follows just behind the figurehead, carving its way through the choppy waters like a plow through untilled land.The Depravity is the largest ship in The Imperial Navy, and, as far as anyone is aware, the world. The Empress commissioned it from master shipwright Antonio Stark , and it was one of the first finished at Port Silverion\u2019s naval yard. Along with its size, its design is, perhaps, gratuitous. With the same resources, The Navy could likely field four or five \u2018regular\u2019 warships. And that might be more efficient, technically speaking, but, as she put it at the time, \u201cIt\u2019s about sending a message.\u201d The details of the message are left to interpretation, but one thing is clear: Naoki\u2019s boat is bigger than yours.The flag of The Empire flies high from the mainsail, boldly declaring who rules these waters. Burnished red metal plating coats the sides of the vessel, again bearing The Imperial Insignia prominently in spotless paint. Ballistae of varying sub-descriptions line the straight sides of the ship, though they are unattended as of present. The ship is sailing without its full complement of 700 crew.Another notable feature: the magic circles, one toward the bow and the other up upon the castle at the rear. These two areas are open and prepared for magic use, featuring a few simple but widely applicable magics to supply power for and augment spellcasting. They are placed in these positions as to give the mages using them good angles and ample space from which to launch projectiles, but that is not how they are being used at present. Circles of robed Enclave Magi stand in both circles, working cooperatively to maintain two powerful spells. At the front, they project a protective barrier, intended to shield the ship from incoming danger but not interfere otherwise. It\u2019s far from a foolproof spell, but it functions well in keeping the worst of the weather at bay. At the rear of the ship, Magi put wind in The Depravity\u2019s sails, allowing her to move quickly in whichever direction she chooses, as the wind will always be at her back. Other methods are available for sailing swiftly, but this one is simple, effective, and unlikely to backfire. Command of the ship is currently in the hands of one Captain Grimhildr, an experienced warship captain substituting for Gothmog. The captain is under orders to sail to Paradise Island, and \u2014 ideally, dock, bring passengers aboard, and follow the commands of the High Marshal as best he can, pending further orders. And again, ideally, to not wreck the ship. In keeping with these orders, Captain Grimhildr orders the helmsman to bring them to the most dock-worthy position available and yells for the anchor crew to ready.", "link_list": ["/user/607", "/user/1528", "http://i.imgur.com/gtb7lU9.gif"], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/gtb7lU9.gif"], "html": "Though a crashing wave emerges the glorious visage of none other than "}, "post-77593": {"user": "Alden Marshal", "user_num": 794, "timestamp": "1515385080000", "message": "Alden receives a brief message back from Naoki as Bora rockets around town informing every one of the plan. \"Rescue is coming.\" Alden says loud enough so all the gathered people can hear. \"It should be here soon we just need to hold on until then.\" Then there are eyes in the dark and bows firing and eerie ominous laughter in the woods.
