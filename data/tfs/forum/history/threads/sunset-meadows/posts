Though it was true, she didn't know for sure that he was a thief, it was just something in his demeanor and dress that pointed in that direction. She fingered that lovely necklace at her throat again, after having dropped the fabric of her skirt. \"So, supposing you are a thief, your objective is to take something that belongs to me, correct? Like this pretty necklace? I won't simply hand it over to you, not even if you were to point that blade of yours at me. You'll have to remove it from my person of your own will. You're welcome to try. But you'll do it fairly or not at all.\" This was all said with the releasing of a breath, she sounded rather wary at that, and the smile was no longer present on her face.\"Not to say you are a thief, though. For all I know, you could simply be a nomad.\" A shrug was given.The bat caught her eye, she glanced over to it with a brief squint and then looked back to the prey she was stalking. Her patience was wearing thin. The stalking of him was no longer fun, and her hunger was gnawing. But she still had the element of surprise on her side, for he clearly saw she was \"unarmed\" as it were. But no, no... just a little bit longer... One must bide their time when dealing with someone shifty.She smiled again and leaned close enough to him that the necklace would be sure to catch his eye. If, indeed, he was wanting to steal from her, that would be the only thing she had on her of value. Add to that, a soft hum was in her throat, \"I would like to kiss you now,\" she said in a sing song voice, \"But if you won't, perhaps I shall seek my comfort elsewhere...\" She continued this sing song stuff, and eventually, a rather intoxicating scent, a cloying one, would curl gently against his nostrils, enticing him. If it worked, he would want to come closer. \"I just want some comfort.. I've been alone for so very long. You do that, and I might be... persuaded to give you what you desire.\" She lifted her hand from her necklace and just barely curl those fingers, ever so close to his chin, so close that the slight breeze might be felt in their passing. \"Just a kiss.\" came the sing song again, \"Will you do that?\"The presence of the bat, for some reason, made her want to be done with this blood letting.
