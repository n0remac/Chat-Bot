Some of the villages have converted to Angelism and are generally civilised, whilst others bow to daemonic forces and unknown dark overlords. People have long since given up settling here permanently as the area floods much too often, however many people live on small barges, derricks and boats mostly trading and fishing. There can often be seen patrols both from the Brotherhood and from the barbarians on the other side. Occasionally even small raids occur but they are difficult to organise.\u00a0", "link_list": ["https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7PkbIQ7wV8"], "image_list": ["http://proof.nationalgeographic.com/files/2015/09/03_p72-73-water-buff-and-huts-RGB.jpg"], "html": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7PkbIQ7wV8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Background Music</a>"}, "post-54372": {"user": "Fyodor van Moltke", "user_num": 1843, "timestamp": "1477269101000", "message": "(max , Aluandra )Fyodor had taken time off from working as Komtur in the Winterlands, he had other business to attend to right now.

The Knight also quickly handed the man a\u00a0large sword, by classification only an ordinary long-knife or messer. However they might notice that it had an odd colour and was not particularly shiny. The Priest swung it a few times and put it in a sheathe on his back. \"You like?\" he said rater colloquially. \"The sword in the reward will be one like it. It is rather unique in that it is made from the iron of the blood of a thousand men.

So long as you kill a wizard or some other magic user with it once every ten years you have an impeccable weapon requiring no maintenance.\u00a0Once they were afloat, he would hold his hands apart to get the wind, and feel the sun on him. \"Right, it will be sun-down soon and the nearest village is quite far.
