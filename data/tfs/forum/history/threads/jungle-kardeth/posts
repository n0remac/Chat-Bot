His right leg was bent at the knee, left leg stretching as far out as possible. His right arm dug its claws into the ground, his left hand embracing the handle of his greatsword, whose blade rested upon his shoulder blade as he stared at them.\u00a0The first, more mighty of the tigers, remained in front of them, the other simply circling him. Obviously, this was the apex of the group. A snarl was sent out towards Aithen, who returned the same aggression with his own lungs. Suddenly, the beastly figure began to take small steps, then emitting into the prancing sprint towards Aithen.Now was his time to shine. Leaping upwards, his blade twirled, slashing upwards as the Lionkin leaped into the air, emitting a full circle as he landed, jerking it to the left to spin the blade around. Once his left foot landed, his rotation towards his left ended, facing exactly the same direction as he was before. As he landed, he continued to bull his sword leftwards, resulting in the slashing of the tiger's left ribcage, soon diving over the falling corpse as the other tigers began to engage in combat.The Lionkin roared out a triumphant call, obviously taking pride in this challenge. His Kusarigama was soon whipped out, spinning the blade with a hand halfway down the chain, the weight tied around his belt as he continued to fight. Two of the beasts crashed forward, sprinting. Once again, Aithen had began spinning around, gaining momentum with his greatsword as he slung the other weapon at them. It slashed into the left tiger's right arm, tasting its flesh as he whipped his sword around him to finish the circle, continuing to spin. But the tigers didn't fall for that trick twice, the greatsword missing its target as the tiger pranced off behind him.From here, the Lionkin stabbed his blade into the dirt, leaving it there. Grabbing his Kusarigama with both hands now, he whipped it as the left tiger made a slow turn-around, where the end of the blade entered its skull. Yanking it so he began to move the beast, Aithen began sprinting in a small circle around his sword. Eventually, as his speed increased, the tiger began to drag on the ground, faster and faster until it was lifted up. Flicking his wrist, Aithen soon pointed his arm straight ahead towards one of the patient tigers, the shockwave continuing down the chain until it made the blade-end of his weapon leave the tiger's skull, sending the corpse atop its comrade.Hearing the leap from behind him, Aithen ducked downwards, kicking his right foot outwards behind him into the air. Aithen soon heard the tiger crash onto its back, snarling in a hint of rage. Immediately, the Lionkin threw his weapon to the side, emitting a dangerous melee act with the enemy. Slashes and pounds were given to one another, making both bleed. After a sudden blow to his chest, Aithen gave the beast an uppercut, which made the tiger slide backwards a bit, giving it enough room to flee from the combat.Eventually, his sword was yanked back out, his chain wrapping around his arm as he looked back to the five or six tigers that continued to walk steadily towards him. He should've re-strategized his combat, already breathing heavier than normal. But soon, however, a trunk-snapping roar emitted from the depths of the Jungle, sending pulses of energy throughout it to shake even the highest of leaves. From here, all raised their ears, as well as their eyes, looking towards where the noise came from. Soon, snapping was heard, heavy footprints. The tigers fled, making Aithen sigh in relief, as well of stress, slamming the sword onto his back as he turned around, beginning to prance and leap away as fast as he could from this Jungle. He had stayed for too long now, and his objective for relaxation was compromised. He just hoped that it didn't catch him before he fled the jungle.-----------Aithen exits the Jungle of Kardeth------------", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/warriorsofmyth/images/b/b2/Tiger_warrior_Wallpaper_1024x768_wallpaperhere.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130612221842"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/warriorsofmyth/images/b/b2/Tiger_warrior_Wallpaper_1024x768_wallpaperhere.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130612221842\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/>"}, "post-25867": {"user": "Zar'Dura the Listener", "user_num": 1055, "timestamp": "1456607964000", "message": "They had been wandering for several days by the time the jungle loomed up before them.

And before he knew it there were four, all looking down upon them, hesitant upon their continuation of violent acts. \"Damn... what are these things!?\" He shouted in agony, looking to them all.The one behind them began to speak up suddenly, voice low and booming, random elephant noises heard within the speech. \"We, are the judges of Kardeth!!\" Stomping around, one of them spoke up to continue the sentence. \"And you have been casted judgment upon for trespassing!

From there, the fire dissipated from his hands and his eyes faded from the glow to show orbs of emotion and sympathy.\"You must not, you cannot, blame yourself for what has been decided for Theev'Nok.. He was a great warrior, a proud man, forged with the strength of the mountains. But yet, All-Maker viewed him more worthy for his task above.\" He looked upwards to emphasize the next life Theev'Nok ascended to. \"Do you truly think after all of this time, Theev'Nok was immortal?\" What sounded like a rhetorical question soon followed up with something actually praising Zar'Dura. \"Because I do, Zar'Dura. He has never so much been injured upon the battle field, and to rise to the heavens above means his time upon this world was finished, his tasks were done. This means.. that defending you.. was important.\" He looked up from the ground to stare to her with stern eyes. \"You are special, Zar'Dura. In more ways than you know. Theev'Nok saw this, and I see it.\"Letting go of her, he hoped he made things a bit less tense, sighing to her statement. \"If this is all true, I fear he may have changed entirely. He seems too proud of himself to be the Great Elder I was born from, someone who held compassion and respect the highest. Or.... was that because he was forced to...?\" He questioned himself, the sense of loss filling him as well now. \"... If it is true that my father was not who I thought he was in the first place, than I must hurry my pace to become the next Shaman King.\" He spoke with duty now, to the people, rather than for himself.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Suddenly, all grew dark and miserable, except for Kold'Ron.

The tree of magic, found fairly deep inside Kardeth. Nowhere too deep, as it was more of a rarity than a singular being of existence. The area around it covered in snow, the area above revealing the singular area of the jungle to snow. Indeed this was sacred ground. The tree hummed with a magic, the air around it calming, nearly bringing ecstasy to the duo as they neared it.The leaves themselves seemed to be flat, with frills sticking outwards along the branches. The term \"Drink\" was more to inhale, as the light, purple vapors around the branches seemed to collect only around the leaves. Should one inhale these vapors from the tree, a sudden unlocking would occur in them: Knowledge beyond any books about magic. Understandings of what seems impossible even for magic. But truly, the strongest thing to fathom from inhaling the magic, was the code of it. The meaning of magic, why it is here, and what it is meant for, all the reasons hidden within the tree itself.Kold'Ron simply stood there in awe, wanting to rush up there and partake in the ritual once again as he had so many years ago.
