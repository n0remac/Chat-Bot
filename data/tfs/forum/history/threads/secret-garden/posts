You might be walking along, traveling, a firm destination in mind or perhaps just a restless wandering on your boots, and suddenly form the corner of your eye, you'll see it, there in the darkened shade of the forest you've found yourself in...the opening to, perhaps, a cave? Vines half-cover it, flowering -- no matter the time of day, no matter the season. In fact, it could be the dead of winter or the gold of autumn, and the green moss and vines and small flowers near it would still be lush and emerald. There were even stone steps that led there, as if they were once made to be inviting but somehow became forgotten...To travel inside is to invite darkness, and the feeling of damp everywhere. Not a single light to guide you through it, but the further you go, the closer you'll get to the fresh smell of water and greenery -- not flowers, per se, but the scent of a forest. It is then that a pale light draws you into the opening of a very secret, tranquil garden.A veritable eden, strange flowers never before seen before -- new plants, new vines, new shrubs, new fruits and vegetables that grace no herbology books, no travel journals, no record anywhere -- bloom before you. Trails of magic light seem to float here and there, making designs in the air but they do not give off the essence of life, merely decoration. The sound of gently cascading water might greet your ears, hinting to a delicate waterfall nearby. For all that it seems melodic, however, there is no sign of any other living creature...... even though tiny little houses seem to hang from tree branches.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/f1/a4/91/f1a4916611977e006f438dc736c1a04f.jpg", "https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/73/eb/5c/73eb5c9040cab9c383eeb01880a8f818.jpg"], "html": "<font size=\"5\"><b>S</b><b>tranger things have happened</b></font>"}, "post-67762": {"user": null, "user_num": null, "timestamp": "1495514775000", "message": "Kelly could be seen walking in backwards, her eyes on a map of an entirely different region than the garden's.\"Okay, this is bullshit, I know I took a left at Lux, I should be in....\"  She said as she looked up and trailed off.
