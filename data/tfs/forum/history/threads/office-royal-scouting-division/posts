It started with smell, scents masked by musk or flowers that shouldn't be there, the lack of \"human\" in the air, rich food haunted the halls and made his mouth yearn for these luxuries. The feeling of not belonging to this place crept into his heart like a knife guided by malice. He cast his eyes down and watched the guards feet instead of watching the faces around him. When the guard stopped he looked up through a door leading to the lobby. He thanked the guard and went into the lobby and took to a corner, watching the entrance to the lobby and the other doors until someone called for him. He had no real idea of how these things worked, the only work he had done was self-employment up until this point.
