Inside, the sounds of metal upon metal thundered against the stone building. The grunts of effort from warriors locked in a sparring match pulled her eye to the side. She watched them as she turned the chestnut mare into the gate and rode her slowly down the yard. They did not look undisciplined to her.The animal began to sense her hesitation and its ears rotated to find the source of anxiety. Together, they moved uncertainly down the lane.  It had only been about thirty minutes since she was left ALONE outside the carpenter's tent. It had taken her fifteen minutes just to find a way to get onto the horse without help.\u00a0\u00a0Mud clung to the sides of her red leather boots and to the hem of her dark green dress. The fur trimmed cloak she wore rippled in the wind. Her hair, left long to her waist, was partly pinned down by the cloak. A long strain it had escaped, and fell down her arm. The Stag Horn forehead adornment she wore made the rest of her hair bunch up so that she looked like she never brushed it. Osma leaned forward and pulled the dress out from below her. It was hard getting onto a sidesaddle without assistance and the garment had bunched below her. Her eyes scanned the men for one in particular, but they all looked the same. \"Excuse me. I'm looking for a solider. He would have just arrived shortly before me.\" Unless she had passed him on the road somehow. He had, after all, been walking.

So she said nothing about it.Once the smelly men went to bath together, they were semi alone in the large hall.

The gloves she still wore would prevent that anyway. She turned her thoughts on the cork. Never had she uncorked her own bottle before. She paused to watch him open his. Seemed easy enough. The gloves would not allow her to grip it correctly and she set the wine cask on a table and pulled the gloves off. She set them over her belt and then unpinned the clasp of her cloak. He thought she would shy away from gruesome injuries. \"A mistake often made.\" The beauty about being such a self absorbed bitch was that she didn't really care how other people were feeling. Made it easier to help the dying. The only thing she didn't like about it was the unexpected occasions when she did not have the proper garments on.

Fairy bubbles were not in the bottle however, and she was safe. With a real smile, which increased her face's natural beauty far more than the fake smile she often wore, rose across her face.It was much like uncorking vials of powders and the like. She looked to him to see if he was going to produce a cup, but he looked extremely comfortable laid back on furs and drinking from his cask directly. Really comfortable. Like a man who was confident in his space and in his own skin kind of comfortable. Why had she asked him to put a shirt back one? Osma gulped and turned her eyes to the fire. Sometimes one must do what was culturally acceptable. She eyeballed the mouth of the bottle, figured there was no one important around to see her and took a drink from the neck. All the while, she actually listened to his history. Not once did she roll her eyes or check her nails. He was not murderously boring. Thank God, someone knew how to sum up a history. He was defeated by horse people. Was that why he hadn't been riding a horse earlier? What kind of adventures did she seek? She shrugged. There hadn't been a lot of thought in pack up, sneaking out and getting on the boat with the Move to Aozora flyers. At the mention of new suitors, her upper lip curled and she shifted her knees away from him. Glaring at him as if to say \"ew\".

His laugh was even handsome. Osma waited until she heard the bathroom door close before she opened her eyes. What had Orocles meant by \"my women\". Had he many wives? \"No. Not looking for suitors. Avoiding them, actually. I suppose I'm....well. I'm....\" She exhaled and took a drink of the wine to stall. It was good wine. The best she had, had so far. \"I'm just trying to make my own way.\" She stated for his ears only. \"My life was rather paved out for me. I don't like to be told what to do.

Her head turned at the same time, which some how helped to show her fantastic cheekbones, her full lips and the curve of her left breast at the same time. She had practiced that move in the mirror for two years.

You're a warrior, they get hurt. I'm a healer, I....\" She brought her bottle to her mouth to muffle her whisper. \"... profit off the hurt.\" Why did he get up to look out to window near the door and ask her that? \"Are you...\" her eyes slid to the bathroom door. Then back at him. \"Nervous\" she mouthed. Even she knew that a commander did not want to seem \"weak\" around his men. Really, why was he all the way over there? It was much more comfortable near the fire. With the rain and the crackle of logs how could they hear one another. With the roll of her eyes and a sigh she did the unthink.  She  got up to go to  him .She took the cask with her and seemed to float across the floor, so elegant was her walk. She stopped near his flank, still a social acceptable distance away from him.

Her cask holding hand moved at the ready to throw the liquid into his face, but the command to finish the act never left her brain. What did leave her brain was certainly not the command to strike, nor to breathe, nor to do anything but to stand there and look stupid as her skin ripened into the color of a raspberry. He was out in the rain before her breathe took in, giving her the power to speak. \"Huh.\"His leg was over his horse before she mustered the word \"How\". His horse was turned and he was off at a rain sputtering gallop before she spoke out \"dare you.\" Osma swallowed and moved the hand upon which his kiss has rested against the frame of the lodge's door.
