Luckily, most people are willing to talk. Sometimes human women kiss me. Haven't turned into a prince yet, though.\"As the frog and the lizard-person thing spoke, Ms. Crowley laughed.\"Why, there are plenty of good things, little girl. It's just that they're all so boring...it's so much more fun to get them from others. And there are also so many different flavors of energy, so many types of magic...like that little frog friend of yours. I wonder what he'd taste like...\"Meanwhile, behind her, the well overflowed again, and something broke the surface. The tops of an odd, two-pointed hood rose out of the water, followed by a blank, faceless mask. The rest of the body soon followed, floating slowly to the surface until the odd figure clambered out of the water and sat quietly on the edge of the well.
