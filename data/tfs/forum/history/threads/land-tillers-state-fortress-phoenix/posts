He was devoted to the Kiraxo Scrolls and would make sure any ear could hear his will at any time. As for the services of the Six Faces from Demitius, they were private and guarded. This side of the religion was more of a popular cult than anything. Unless invited, nobody would know what these messages were, as they were all normally involved in dark magics of some kind. The Phoenix State was founded with both and Demitius lead a group that had their own way of keeping peace even though their religion wasn't the best. Still, they used portions of the Kiraxo Scroll, but twisting them for their wants.Both of the Grand Phoenixians, Achrio with the head of Ra, and Demitius with the head of the Second Face, Ja'uul the Wolf. Their religious magics were phenomenal. They could convert most anyone to their religion the moment they hear their first word. They didn't control their mind, but somehow their magic has found a way to pull on the religious part of the brain. It was even more effective when people had the 'God Gene' in them. Despite being about peace, don't be a fool, they fight as a team, a duo of Light and Dark fighting as one. When their services were over, the two got together, Achrio speaking, \"Service was good... It is promising land here. The Phoenix State must have high hopes for these people and their land, they sent us to lock down on the religion. Amun Ra must smile upon The Phoenix State every day... Since the return of Zaltos Kiraxo, we have been free and almost what we could consider a Nirvana.\"Demitius would respond firmly as he took his seat in the Prayer Hall between the two cathedrals for both religions to congregate and pray together; This helped keep them united instead of brewing up hatred because one worshiped another, \"Brother, even you know war will come... When it comes and we are still sitting here, you can celebrate. But eventually, our mighty people will be in war somewhere... And we will see how Amun Ra smiles then.

At best, their people had mastered basic crop rotation and the use of irrigation and fertilizer.

Despite also being middle aged, she tended to act like an aggressive teenager with a natural disdain for formalities. This behavior however was typical of the Acacia Clan people.Ying-Na was extremely proud of her two bows, one a short bow enchanted by her daughter Jun, and one long bow she purchased in Katashima. Arrows fired from both bows contained a touch of elemental magic which made them more resilient and imbued them with special properties. The short bow's arrows caused a paralyzing effect, and the long bows' a tranquilizing effect. This is important as she likes to consider herself her husband's bodyguard... Although one would do well not to challenge either of them in combat.\"So, we are looking for two priests, Acrid and Diminishes?\" Ying-Na said.Raynor grimaced. \"Just let me do most of the talking.\"Ying-Na grinned. \"Hey, I heard they need a State Representative.\"Raynor sighed. \"One clan is enough for me.

They dismounted from their steeds and encouraged their entourage to join in on the feast. \"I'm glad you think so. Yes, this land is very special to us. The truth is our tribes have lived here as long as we can remember, and we have always tried to live peacefully with nature. However, about 60 years ago we experienced a terrible civil war. Our people have an above average affinity for magic, and a class of dark wizards emerged which converted the expanse into a dictatorship. Much of our old history was lost, but since then we've striven to maintain a democratic republic, where our people are elected based on their age and wisdom.\"Ying-Na was enthusiastically gorging herself on the bread, but saw fit to interrupt. \"Are you sure he didn't mean about us personally?\" Raynor rolled her eyes and gestured for her to speak while he helped himself to some bread. \"Raynor was elected as leader of his tribe because of his skills in healing and defensive magic, which just goes to show he doesn't take after his mother at all. You've probably heard her name get dropped a lot. Lynx of the Celadine Clan. She and Elder Havador are among our more important historical figures, since they lead the rebellion against the dark necromancers. I'm sure that helped you get elected too by the way.\"Raynor sighed. When his wife was right, she was right. \"Yes, my mother also lead the fight against the dragons which happened after the civil war. An unfortunate incident where dragons sought refuge in this land, but for some reason were overcome with the desire to wipe us out instead. From what I remember it was almost like they were infected with something. The truth remains a mystery.\"\"Are you going to tell them about the chaos?\" One of Ying-Na's soldiers, a young girl with a short-bow, spoke up. Ying-Na nodded. \"Mmm, yes, that is an important part of our history, though the details have been lost.\"Raynor nodded in agreement. \"Yes, it's one of the mysteries of this land. It's interesting that you say Amun Ra smiles upon this place, because one of our more prominent religious beliefs states that the Expanse is a nexus of the conflict between light and darkness. There wasn't a lot to support this belief until Lynx became a chaos mage. A chaos mage is a being that appears whenever the balance between light and darkness is broken, and acts as an equalizer. Lynx happened to be good, although supposedly evil chaos mages have appeared in the past. My daughter Jun has Lynx's diary, so she probably understands the phenomenon better than I do. But it would seem that the universe essentially chooses a chaos mage based on their understanding of both light and darkness. They must have an intimate knowledge of both within their heart, and from there are guided to pick that which is necessary to the world. Thanks to Lynx's efforts, the Expanse's balance has been shifted away from darkness towards the light.\"Ying-Na took a swig of wine and added, \"Yah, Lynx was a good person but she was into some nasty stuff I'll tell you. And she could be a terrible smart ass.\" Raynor growled somewhat at this. Ying-Na shrugged and grinned mischievously. \"What? She was my mother-in-law too you know. Jun's into some dark stuff too. I once caught her and her boyfriend-\"The same guard that brought up the chaos smacked her master in the shoulder. \"You'll have to forgive her. An intolerance for alcohol runs in both our clans.\" Ying-Na smiled, red-faced. She wasn't actually inebriated... yet. \"Oh, and one more thing. My husband is a master agriculturalist. Our tribe often combines magic with agriculture to get the best results.\"Raynor was still trying not to think about what kind of dark stuff his daughter might be into. \"I think we've hogged enough of the conversation.
