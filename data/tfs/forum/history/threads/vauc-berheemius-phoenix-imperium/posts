The gates would rise and they would let the Fremen in. Naturally the Shokan were intimidating and they didn't worry about the Fremen much when they came along. As quick as Stilgar entered, the gates would shut behind him.Inside, an officer was there to escort Stilgar, \"Grand General Sinn said you would be coming soon. I am here to take you to him, there are many things for you to discuss.\"The Pit Kiraxan would escort Stilgar to a castle within the underbelly city. This castle seemed isolated and radiated a power dark energy. Unlike the rest of the population, this castle was protected by a different being. Their armor was black and crafted with a stone that seemed to glow red under the energy that surrounded the castle. Their shields seemed to be controlled by a rune that produced energy to create their shield or sword. One could tell magic was definitely used here, enough to prevent any Anti-Magic to have any real effect within it's walls or it's guardians, the Grand Kiraxan Army. \u00a0While some of the Arian Kiraxans were visible, others were not. This castle granted these warriors armor superb bonuses when equipped with the proper Runes. Since all Kiraxans did not believe in a god, they knew it was up to them to work with nature to create weapons and armor with the most 'Green' element; magic. Drumbar Steel was the metal base for their armor.Since Stilgar was being escorted he would not be bothered. He could look at the alien like design, making the stone walls as smooth as steel, as if it had been built and not carved. Eventually, after viewing the dragonoid castle, they would reach a room.\u00a0The Arian Kiraxan would open the massive door and let Stilgar in. What Stilgar would find inside was menacing and immaculate. It resembled a dragon and armor in every aspect. Sitting in the throne was a man garbed in black armor and a mighty basilisk that had a metal like exoskeletal system.\u00a0\"Do you bring news of the Red Sun? I feel his power, but I need affirmation that it is him... The Kiraxan and Fremen should be free, not contained beneath the ground.\" the man in the throne spoke.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/dc/da/b7/dcdab73966d9fdbbc213bb3d634d6fa5.jpg", "http://img10.deviantart.net/68cf/i/2014/050/9/c/dark_kro__fleetmaster_kroudon__rogamee_revisioned__by_uhzenostrom117-d75fl5x.jpg", "https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/Tv7sOOgLTzS6LOLi1bOi"], "html": "The Pit Kiraxans(Shokan) made no effort to stop Stilgar.
