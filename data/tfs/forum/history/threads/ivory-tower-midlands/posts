He'd meant to say something, or at least that's what he told himself, but the woman looked beautiful in that copper tub, the foresight playing off of her features, the rise of the water teasing his senses as it obscured enough of her to titilate his imagination.When she sputtered in the bath, that quicksilver grin flashed over his features, but he put a hand over his mouth to stop any laugh. It dropped from his chin when he leaned against the door frame, crossing one booted ankle over the other.Then he saw her. Naked. And beautiful. She wasn't the shape of the lusty tavern wenches he preferred, but she was graceful. Her curves weren't as dramatic, but they were elegantly and femininely molded to the pretty lines -- and just like he thought, she had great legs. Her bottom and breasts were sweetly rounded, her belly flat and her back graceful. She had the body of a dancer, or what he imagined a faerie might look like. Altogether almost ethereal and not human.Then again... this woman turned into a horse. So. There's that.When she sat, her back to him, gently brushing her hair and singing that melody, he got a grip of himself and was glad that the clothes he held in one fist by his thigh draped in a way to hide what her nakedness did to him.\"Am I interrupting?\" He asked from the doorway, a devilish gleam in his eyes, a boyish grin on his mouth.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "He hadn't just seen the way the towel dropped around her waist, he had seen far more than that."}, "post-55909": {"user": null, "user_num": null, "timestamp": "1479147184000", "message": "She was startled and dropped the brush.
