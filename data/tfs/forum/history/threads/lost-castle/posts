How it came to be remains a question unanswered. Most of the stone supports and walls are withered and broken into masses of rock that settle on the ocean floor. Coral and kelp have come to overtake most of the environment, and it's rumored to just be home to all manner of sea creatures now.Inside it is just as broken as the outside. And the number of rooms are spacious but few in number: a library with shelves still lined, though a single touch to any book or scroll might render them ruined. A dining hall branching from a large kitchen. Guest rooms and servant dwellings dot through the lower halls. A grand sitting room, perhaps akin to a family room for the royal line that might have resided here once, and an eloquent bedroom fit for a king. An armory, though there is little to be salvaged save for mineral materials. A laboratory tower that holds remains of the instruments but no salvageable ingredients. Stables with nothing but denizens of the deep sheltered within the walls. Long hallways lined with tattered carpet and tapestries, along with worn profiles in once golden frames now rusted.Rumor has it, to those that have heard of the sunken castle, that there are still riches buried in the treasury - and actual crystals tucked away, brought up from the darkest depths no man or beast has dared to descend to.An odd addition to the place lies before the very steps - a massive hole cut down into the earth beneath the water, seeming to wind to the very heart of the world. The walls are relatively smoothed from constant brushing against. The diameter a good 60-70 feet across and if one could even manage to find the bottom of the tunnel, they would find it well over 400 feet deep. It might become apparent this is more recently constructed than the original castle, and created by something massive.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/VraSKC8.jpg"], "html": "<b><img alt=\"\" height=\"671\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/VraSKC8.jpg\" width=\"1121\"/><br><br/></br></b>"}, "post-41340": {"user": "Neva-Svir-Suna, Wavewarden", "user_num": 1538, "timestamp": "1465915373000", "message": "\"Finally.\"Days of flying over the seas, occasionally dipping in to see if the source of the magical power was closer, were finally over.
