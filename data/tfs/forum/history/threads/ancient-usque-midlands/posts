Something about it put her on edge, hopefully the journey through it would be short. Her instructions had been clear, she was in charge of an operation to make a new ally, and she was to be reinforced by some rangers. While she waited on their arrival, she found a decent spot in some nearby bushes to hide, in case anything unfriendly came along in the meantime. A quick application of her wilderness magic made her nigh undetectable to the normal senses while she remained in her hiding spot.
