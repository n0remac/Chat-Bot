A small grouping of buildings and houses surrounded by several miles of farmlands. The town has no real notable features other than its yearly harvest celebration. The festival is known to pull in people from several other towns and villages in the area due to its jubilant atmosphere (and free alcohol). The area is also known to be good for hunting field game like deer and rabbits.\u00a0 \u00a0The village has a small tavern that rents out two rooms to travelers, or will let them sleep on the floor of the commons room for free. There is also blacksmith, tannery, and brewery. The brewery makes a special local ale called Red Sheaf. The ale is flavored with cherries grown in a nearby town and is popular in both towns.\u00a0 \u00a0Eaddtun has no walls or defensive buildings. A few unarmored men stand at either end of the town, armed with old pikes. There are a few retired veterans in the community that teach basic combat, but most of the townsfolk's time is spent working the fields or trades. Spare time is generally spent drinking and reveling.\u00a0 \u00a0Recently they have run a man named Apus out of town. He is the son of a farmer, but when his father and mother died, he left the fields to fallow and eventually become overtaken by weeds. In the years since his parents died, he had been studying necromancy. In order to further his studies, he began to dig up bodies from the town's small graveyard. The rest of the town saw this as an affront to nature and threatened to lynch him if he didn't leave. The farm now stands empty as none of the villagers want to go near it for fear that it may be haunted or filled with hideous undead.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\u00a0 \u00a0Eaddtun looked like many rural community villages.

The troops were eager to gain some fresh blood, but first most of them would head to the tents and sleep, some units (including Nat'ia) kept watch over night, in case they were spotted.\"Good, we'll gonna wait til darkness falls so we can get up on em.
