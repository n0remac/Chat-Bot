Dozens of worker's backs could be seen, quickly and deftly brushing away the sand from the ruins.

Even in his wildest dreams he could not imagine the find he had discovered here. A entire city, no, an entire unknown and unrecorded civilization beneath his very feet. What etchings they had transcribed from the tops of the black stone pillars was completely different from any other language he had ever seen. Etched into the pillars were symbols of consisting of interconnected circles and straight lines. It shared no similarities at all to any of the languages in the surrounding area, or even the known world. The most amazing part was not the etchings but the pillars themselves. As of yet, no sample of its building material has been taken. As all the picks and chiselled used to try and chip off a slice off the building had rebounded harmlessly off them, leaving not even a scratch. This fuelled Vayrons suspicions that they had been infused with magic. But the fact that its power had remained after all these years was mind blowing. Vayron had to get into the tomb and discover its mysteries. He had only wait for an entrance to be uncovered, and for his hired mercenary to arrive.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Vayron stood inside one of the many tents sistuated around the mouth to the dig sites.
