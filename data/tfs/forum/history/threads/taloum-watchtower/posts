The future is hard to grasp\" He extended a hand, smoke floating from his palm. The smoke spread, and within the smoke a vision showed itself to Nishida. Thousands of men were marching, the countryside ablaze in the background. In the lead of the army was Nishida himself, mounted on a great black stallion. Nishida was in plate\u00a0armor, a warrior he seemed. His face was scarred, his eye filled with rage. \"It is ever branching... Changing\" B\u00e9liar shifted his hand slightly and the view from within the smoke changed. It was as if Nishida was watching a painting in motion, as if he was there. Inside the smoke there was a Nishida that looked very familiar to the one seated behind the table. There was a smile on his face, he was interacting with a woman who's back was turned. This Nishida looked truly happy, his garments were humble and those of a farmer. B\u00e9liar shifted his hand once more, the smoke stirring with it. Inside the smoke was Nishida, resting in the mud of what appeared to be a battlefield. Five arrows were lodged in his torso, he was gasping harshly as blood filled his lungs, he was alone.
