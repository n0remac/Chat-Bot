The first step is learning proper breathing technique. Breathing Technique is something I've trained with for a long time now and I credit it for my control of my abilities. To be able to keep your breathing steady even in a stressful situation is paramount to success, one who can stay calm and think straight has control over themselves.\"Doobie began to instruct Dan Feng on breathing technique, displaying movements for her to mimic. \"Raise your hands up your body as you inhale deeply and slowly, *inhale* now lower them as you expel all the breath you just inhaled *exhales*, now breath in again with the same motion *inhale*, and now exhale while moving your hands forward as if you are pushing the air. Repeat this with me for a minute or so and close your eyes.\"Doobie would continue the exercise along with Dan Feng if she chose to follow along, then he would stop to observe her to see if her breathing was adjusting correctly or to detect any problems with her breathing.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"Let us exit first.\" Doobie would leave Chapel before instructing Dan Feng. \"Now then, I'm assuming from what you told me earlier that Chapel only appears when you need it. Once you need it no longer it shouldn't be too hard. There are variables to how to get it to disappear without having to put effort, from my studies, a Stand can only remain active for a given amount of time and if you go a certain distance from it, it will also dispel or teleport back into range. I'm not sure if you know either of these statistics, but perhaps we can find out. Since you want to learn how to make Chapel go away, we'll try for that first.\""}, "post-43163": {"user": "Lu Dan Feng", "user_num": 1666, "timestamp": "1467582322000", "message": "\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dan Feng follows the kobold out of Chapel with relief.

If one loses the ability to breath, they lose their power.\"Doobie would then introduce more steps to the exercise, making use of the space he had created he taught her motions similar to Tai Chi. In Doobie's demonstration, Dan Feng could observe a shimmer of light outlining Doobie as he moved, this was his energy moving through his body. As he performed certain motions the light would all move to certain parts of his body, demonstrating the distribution of energy as one moves. At the end of his demonstration, the energy all moved to his fingertips and looked like dancing wisps of fire, he moved his fingers around and closed them into fists, ending the kata in bringing his fists in to rest at his waist. He'd then lower his arms and open his palms and raise them high above is head in cicular arc, placing his hands together at the apex and bringing them down to his center, he'd then exhale and the magic disappeared.
