She, Harlen, and Silas had just arrived in New Brimiarde. It was late in the day, and they had some things that they wanted to purchase and do in the city before they set sail, so they would be spending the night at the inn. Hopefully it would give them a full night's sleep before the ship left early the next morning. The entire journey up from Stonevale had been arduous. They didn't get horses until partway through, which had significantly increase their travel speed. It also stopped them from completely running out of food. There was only so much that three people could carry and still make good time. She had gotten to know a little about her two companions, but not much. Nor had she really shared much about herself other than a vague statement that she was running from her home for some very good reasons and that she didn't plan on going back soon. It wasn't that she didn't trust them, but really very few but herself knew the full story and she would keep it that way for as long as possible.With a heavy sigh, she sat down with a thud at a table in the tavern. Leaning forward and putting her head on the rough wood, she closed her eyes and took a minute to rest. They had finally arrived and she wouldn't have to endure another long day of riding for a while. She supposed that one of them ought to go to the harbor and check in on their ship, but they had also agreed that some research would do them good. She had an overview knowledge of the history of the islands, but no more than her childhood education provided. As for the stones themselves, she had only known of the legend, but not the legend itself, which meant she was no help there. But, history could be helpful. Once they got there, the lay of the land would give them a better idea of what to expect. She would also have an easier time figuring out what was where in terms of places she knew of but weren't accurately placed on a map.Arella looked up at her two companions. \"Shall we get some food?

There were a number of travelers, like themselves. A rather somber-looking group in the corner kept to themselves and whispered quietly to each other, taking careful looks around the room. They looked to be a close-knit brotherhood of sorts, even if there wasn't a uniform to identify them by. A rowdy bunch of merchants caught the room's attention as they cheered in the center of the room. From their dress, she guessed them to be from the south, like her. In a moment of panicked realization, she slipped through the room along the walls and made her way to the stairs. She had been thinking about getting a drink before retiring, but this soon after escaping, she didn't want to risk rumors of her whereabouts spreading to home. She may not recognize any of those men, but they would certainly recognize her if they got a good enough look. Not only did she herself come from a family of very wealthy merchants, but she was also considered royalty for several years. Anyone who had been through the palace at home would know her face.Arella had to make a few tight squeezes through groups of people, but she finally made it to the stairs. Going up, she went to one of the rooms Harlen had rented and slipped inside. The loud chatter of the busy tavern below faded to a low buzz as she pulled her sack over her head and off her shoulder. She set it down and then walked over to the little writing desk in the corner. There was an inkwell, pen, and some loose paper sitting out for guests to use. She sat down and pulled a page forward, beginning the letter she wanted to send south. \"My dearest sister...\" It wasn't a long letter, since the fewer details she revealed, the longer she'd be safe, but her sister was probably the most frantic of all her family members, and she deserved to know. At the end, she gave instructions to burn the letter as soon it was read all the way through. She wished her father and mother well, and then said a final goodbye, giving comfort that one day she would return. By the end, Arella was on the verge of tears. With a deep breath, she folded the letter closed and sealed it.Exhausted, she climbed into the bed and fell asleep for a few hours. It wasn't a very deep sleep, but enough to get her by. Just before dawn, as the chickens outside began making noise, she woke. They had been travelling hard and fast for several days and she was used to getting up this early now. Combing her hair and smoothing out her clothing, she went downstairs and out the front door. The sun hadn't broken over the horizon yet, and she wanted to deliver the letter and perhaps watch the sunrise.

He was in the room of the young barmaid who had been helping him carry drinks. She was over by a washbasin, dampening a rag. Taking in the warm, well lit space, he breathed in and out quietly for a few minutes, waiting for his heart to stop beating so rapidly. Looking down at himself, he found his heavy overcoat and shirt had been removed, and he was drenched in a fine layer of sweat. The barmaid looked over, and seeing him awake, walked over to his side and helped him sit up. \"Now, take it easy. Ya just had a bit of a stumble, there. Passed out right at the top of the stairs and almost fell right back down 'em. Ya were a bit closer to my room, and I didn't want to intrude on yar companions, so I took ya back here.\" As he sat up, he hissed and grabbed his forehead. It felt like an entire battalion of chevaliers passed through his brain, then retreated back on the same path. Looking back over the previous day, he supposed he had pushed himself a little too far, and was due to crash from the salts at some point. Still, that dream had not been normal. And the grin that corpse had on its face still unsettled him with its familiarity. If he wished one thing, it would be to not remember the man who wore that grin. He shook his head a few times to clear away any thoughts of what he'd seen. Then he put his arm around the shoulder of the barmaid and worked his way to his feet. He was feeling much better now, in spite of his dream, and she had taken good care not to hurt his rib. Grabbing his jacket, shirt, and cane, he reached into one of his pockets and pulled out three gold coins and handed them to her, thanking her graciously before heading back to his room.Back at the room, he found Arella asleep at the window, surrounded by her notebooks, and Silas gone. He shook his head and smiled. He found some happiness in Silas's wanderlust and Arella's studious habits. It gave him a sense of normalcy from his companions. He laid down his jacket and shirt on the bed then went to where Arella was taking a nap. Pausing briefly to look outside, he was happy that the rain was subsiding a bit, though the ocean in the distance still seemed choppy and rugged. In his reflection, he also noticed his hair once more turned completely white. He sighed. He had relatively good luck in the time since they had left Stonevale, not having to redye his hair, not even after his incident in the catacombs, so he still had plenty of his special dye left, but it was still and annoyance to have to reapply it. Leaning down, he gave Arella a soft shake. \"While you are free to sleep where you wish, my friend, you may want to rethink your current choice.\" He said with a light chuckle.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<i>Fleeting images pass by in the darkness.

It's part of how we became so well known and respected. There was a time, in fact, that I'd have had one of the finest educations in magic in the known world. However, those who possess magic in our family pay a price; those who are sensitive to magic are also sensitive to the world around us. It sometimes changes how it manifests from person to person, but the most common symptom is fear. Not your average phobia or worry, but a constant, paranoid terror that the world will swallow you whole at any moment. A fear so strong, that it turns your hair white unless magically altered, and even then it will still bleed through given enough time.\" He pointed to his hair, emphasizing the point. \"Most Sinclair children, if they have magic, are taught to control that part of themselves before they are even allowed near a spell book. I, however, never had the opportunity to learn to control it. Which is why I use these.\" He reached under his shirt and pulled out the white smelling salts he had. \"A bit of a cheap workaround. It keeps me calm and dazed so I can function, but my dependence on them is... trying, to say the least. As for why I dye my hair...\" He paused once more, thinking very carefully about the next part. \"My family still has enemies, and I have enemies of my own. The white hair makes me stand out, and if someone is smart enough, they can realize that it marks me as a Sinclair. I'd rather not risk bringing trouble to myself or those I travel with because of something as simple as my hair.\" He looked down in silence for a while, seeming at once very tired, and very alone.After a moment, he looked up and smiled. \"Now look who's rambling.
