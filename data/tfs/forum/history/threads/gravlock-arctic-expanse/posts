As he woke, blue lines began to pulse on his folded in wings that  acted like a lThe walls would begin to glisten, reflecting like mirrors. Diamonds and sapphires covered the walls. Gold and other metal treasures covering the floor helped reflect the light.The mighty dragon would rise, his head pressing against the top of the cave as he stretched. His body, due to his color, looked like a diamond itself. Steam rose from his body as the heat he trapped beneath him came in contact with the moist air. He would begin to check on the other rooms in his cave.One room, full of scrolls and magical items was untouched, covered in light snow that had blown in since it was the the end of the main hall. He'd move to check his pools and waters, seeing they were as full and blue as ever. His food source that called these underground waters home was plentiful. Everything was as he left it. When he reached the opening, everything outside had changed. It was completely frozen. Nothing existed for miles. Immediately his heart was broken, as the humanoids that called these lands home were like his children. The only reason he was here, the love of the humanoids who worked hard in these lands for what they had, was crushed in their absence. Gravlor woke happy, but seeing this, his tear drops would fall from his eyes. In rage from sadness, Gravlor would release a mighty roar that would cause a series of avalanches. With this roar, he would release mighty beams of a blueish white beam of energy that would carve the mountains and cut the air.A black cloud filled the air, one that had left the dragon Trogdor. In Gravlor's rage from his sadness, the cloud would enter Gravlor from every opening. His blue lines of energy would grow darker, his eyes following the same path. With a mighty flap of his wings, Gravlor blasted into the air. He would leave a trail of destruction as he wrecked the lands that once was his home. How the land had betrayed him and forced his love away. He would seek destruction to any land he came across. If he couldn't have his loves, then no other lands could either.Trogdor's anger had found a new host. Destruction would arrive to anyone seen in the beasts path. With Gravlor's power and Trogdor's anger, few could stand to this beast that he knew of. Right now, he knew nothing but revenge. Until the anger was released, Gravlor was dangerous. A broken heart with anger is always a bad mix. ", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Deep within the expanse was a dragon known as a Ka Dragon. This Ka Dragon is named Gravlor.
