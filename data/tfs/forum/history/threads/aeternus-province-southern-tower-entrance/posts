At daylight \u2013it is pulled open and wedged with a large boulder, allowing free access to those familiar and unfamiliar.\u00a0 At night it is sealed, and radiantly lit with torches.The Southern Tower is erected to the close right of the gate, a formidable structure of three stories \u2013 drawing an imposing silhouette ten feet taller than the wall. The Flag of Aeternus is proudly emblazoned on a huge sheet of fabric, hoisted into the sky.\u00a0 The upper two levels of the alpine edifice are where the patrolling archers spend their six-hour shifts, alternating throughout the day.\u00a0 Sometimes, there might be an engineer or two tinkering around inside or at the gate, but not paying much mind to activities around them.\u00a0A congregation of five warriors stationed on the ground floor, switching only at dawn and dusk; usually watching the gate. Customarily, they do not stop those who pass through the gates, unless they are suspicious or recognized as a criminal.

If Garo watched close enough he could have caught the exasperated eye-roll of the other, sword-bearing guard, as he stepped forward,chuckling inconspicuously,\u201cThere is lodging right down the path from here,\u201d he pointed to his right with an extended arm, right up past the market and shops.\u00a0 \u201cWe hope to afford hospitality and rapport \u2013but we don\u2019t appreciate idle hands.\u201d\u00a0 He smiled, but was it just out of polite habit?\u00a0\u201cIf you wish to seek shelter, you must also earn your keep.\u201d\u00a0 It was a significant pronouncement the traveler should hear now before he decided to make himself at home, if that was his objective.It was evident by the bustling activity around them that this was a rule-of-thumb that Aeternus' population all lived under. There were several trade-workers pushing carts down the gravel paths to and from shops -- many carts were full of food items: bright red, round tomatoes, bunches of grapes and bananas, fresh loaves of bread and jugs of aromatic beverages -- probably wine, some of the carts had rods that held bloody cuts of meat and carcasses. In the background, the cadence of the stone-workers' pickaxes created the melody for the rest of the sounds, a steady rhythm of collaborated effort. Permanent shopfronts vaunted weapons and armor, hot off the anvil, precious stones and gems mined from the Thundering Range, and an assortment of talismen.
