She no longer had a need of the white, thread-like light that was leading them; she knew where she was going.She had dreamed it so many times before.But Asaph was asleep, and as he shifted and moved, Jarkoopi then also came away, his great yellow eyes still bleary and fuzzy.

With no sun to tell what time of day it was, the Swan's sense of passing time was also thrown askew.\"I am fine, now. Thank you for saving me,\" she said to him, and then looked at Asaph. \"I cannot wake him. He took a large drink of the water. And yes, we must go there. That is the way.\"She turned and took something from the sack she held at her hip -- it was a bottle, with a topper upon it. She went over to the river and she filled the bottle with that water. With a rather large sample of it taken from the river itself, they could see that the water did indeed look... oily. The large bottle disappeared quite easily into the little bag, and she tied it once more to her hip.Then, the quiet and self-possessed woman stepped to the edge of the cliff they were standing at and dropped off the edge.

The dragon in wizard form would cry out with a voice whose volume was appropriate for his more fully sized form. Immediately afterwards a bubble of energy would expand outwards from his body. The bubble was like a thick, forceful wall of air. Any arrows and harpoons and breaths of flame would fail against it (hopefully) and anyone who made contact with it would be blown back, but otherwise be unharmed. The bubble would start small but rapidly grow several hundred meters in diameter.
