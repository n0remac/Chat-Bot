In truth, these caves are free to be discovered and named... but too many fall to folly.The entrance to these underground caves only appear every so often, and usually by a pile of large stones. One must either dig through the red sand for hours and hours under the hot sun or frigid moon, or find an opening that will drop you down into the cool darkness of the caves and it's bountiful water.The folly comes from those who drink the water. It is narcoleptic, and will put any -- ANY -- being to sleep, depending on the dosage. It is entirely possible that one might fall asleep and never wake up, thus dying from dehydration or starvation. The glow of the caves comes from the worms that live within them... and these worms feed on the flesh of those that had fallen to sleep, killing them far before any lack of drink or food. Their glow is actual a substance, much like silk worms, and it is acidic to the touch, capable of burning through dragon scale with enough time.And given most drink the water, the glow worms certainly have enough time.For all the serene and awe inspiring deadly beauty of the cave, it's rivers running through do create a sort of underground highway structure within the Red Waste.Careful that you don't fall asleep, however.
