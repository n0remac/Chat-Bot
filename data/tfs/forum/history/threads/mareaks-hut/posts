Located in a heavily wooded forest, the hut has a low thatched roof, so low you can only just stand comfortably.Outside the hut, there is a shallow freshwater stream, with a clothesline suspended between two pieces of wood in the ground.The heavy wooden door of the hut can be pushed both inward and outward, with simple magic keeping it in place when it is not being opened or closed. \u00a0There is a small bed in the far left corner of the room, with a desk in the far right. There is a wall mounted bookshelf above the desk, full of various magical tomes and books of lore. The desk itself is chipped and ink stained, clearly well used and very old. On the right wall, there is a fireplace, with a couch and two living chairs facing it in the center of the room. There is a coffee table as well, with an open book on it, likely one that is in the process of being read.Runes of protection against various spells are inscribed into the walls, so it is difficult, but not impossible to scry on the hut. Teleportation into the hut is also similarly hard.The door is magically locked, so only Mareak and people he gives permission to do so may enter the hut. There is a piece of parchment nailed to the door saying \"please knock\" however.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "This humble, cobblestone hut is the home of the wizard Mareak.
