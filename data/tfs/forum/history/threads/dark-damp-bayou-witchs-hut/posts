This was probably one of the only rooms that was more than crudely built in wood and sap and branches. Actual stones were laid for the floor and built into a simple tub, as well as an odd contraption at one end of the long, rounded tub.It would certainly take a while, possibly a good thirty minutes before the bath was prepared. A fire was cast at the bottom of the contraption, which allowed for the large, smooth stones to begin growing hot in the chamber just above the one that housed the fire. While that was working, the witch moved to the simple hand pump at the other end of the tub - slowly filling the tub with cold water from the very swamp. At least by some means, the water that was pumping in wasn't murky or dirty like the source.When the stones were finally hot, one side of the chamber would open like a panel and spill the stones into the tub, instantly casting the small room in steam with a loud hiss that steadily quietened. The small indention in the bottom of the tub allowed the rocks to settle, but were still far to the end as to avoid having them come in contact with someone that was bathing. A simple design for a bath, but it worked. At least for Serafine.That would leave poor Roxanne with a very wide, 30 minute window for the tea to ease off on the effects and for the woman to make some plot or even flee.

Ordinarily, she would have had no problem swimming such a short distance and running into the woods. However, it the murky waters worried her. There were undoubtedly alligators and snakes swimming just below the surface, and they would be perfectly happy to eat an unarmored and defenseless Roxy. Besides, running through a forest barefoot wouldn't be fun at all. Perhaps she could overpower Serafine, but she'd already seen that the witch was a lot stronger than she looked. Sighing, she stepped back from the window and looked around the room. Surely, there was something she could use! However, she didn't have long to contemplate improvised weapons before she felt a sharp sting at her ankle.
