Formerly an abandoned castle built by an eccentric noble, it is now the official headquarters of the Blood Rose Medical Foundation.Most of it is currently unoccupied. The castle is undergoing renovation by a combination of a crew of dedicated on-site laborers hired from nearby villages, and as a result the appearance of the run-down structure undergoes incremental improvements on a daily basis.Still, despite its improvements, it looks rather unwelcoming, which is something that the founder hopes to fix after renovations are completed.Sometimes the castle will light up with an unholy radiance of sickly red light. Sometimes vast plumes of smoke will explode from the topmost tower. Sometimes guttural roars and terrible screams will echo across the nearby landscape. And so, sometimes nearby villages send brave adventurers to go see \"what that strange girl is up to again\" and report back to them, preferably still in one piece.Once in a while, sickly, desperate, or terminally ill men, woman, and children can be seen heading into the castle, holding themselves barely upright through knowledge of vague rumors and slivers of hope. Some leave, and some don't, but those who do leave often spread the word of their cures... and of other offers made available to them. And so, sometimes more healthy or well-off customers will also pay a visit\u2014for things that are kept very, very secret.All in all, the castle has a somewhat foreboding atmosphere due to its location, scenery, and the rumors surrounding it. Though perhaps the large wooden signboard on the front lawn with the word \"Welcome!\" and a large red smiley face might help alleviate some of less pleasant ones.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/pis4uoD.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"The Clinic\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/pis4uoD.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/>"}, "post-33409": {"user": "Indreni", "user_num": 1069, "timestamp": "1460818543000", "message": "Now that her stint with the circus was done, the light mage had returned to wandering the open world, seeking people whose sufferings to allay with her performances.

Back to the topic\u2014dulling pain, we've got that under control. Not an issue. But if you could serve as a source of magical power... we could definitely use that. We've got a few patients stored in a coldroom, their vital fluids replaced with a magical preservative and their bodies in vats, and we haven't gotten around to them yet mostly because they've either made requests that require significant alterations from their original form or because they want some kind of magical effect that would require a large store of magical power to perform.\"She shrugs. \"We'll get around to them sooner or later, but I think the clients would prefer 'sooner', so it'd be great if you could charge some mage batteries for us.

We won't need to use too much of the gold, depending on the results of the Analyzing Circle and your own personal preferences.

I'm not sure how intense your shows are, but if you output enough light and heat every minute to severely maim someone or turn a house into a blazing conflagration, I think you could fill around ten batteries with that amount of power.\"\"As for the procedure, it shouldn't take too long. Maybe one to two hours to harmonize the implants to you, then another hour for the actual implantation. You'll need to meditate in the Analyzing Circle or do whatever works for you and focus on making your magic recognize the pieces of gold as an essential part of yourself, or you can just imbue your magic into it. Like I said, whatever works for you, for your own magic system. Then we'll go do trademarked, company secret things, that'll result in the crafted implants and an amplification of your magical residues within the implants.\"Rose glances at Indreni, gauging her reaction. \"And then we'll toss you on an Operating Circle, dull your pain or put you into an induced sleep, depending on your preferences, and then cut you open and drive tiny golden spikes into your important bones. The basic augmentation package calls for 54 implants, each approximately half a cubic centimeter's worth of gold. The total gold usage comes out to about 17 gold coins, depending on the currency you're using, so not too bad. If everything goes right, which it should, you should barely even be able to feel the implants unless you're looking for them. And, of course, depending on your preference, you can also opt to add additional implants, as the basic package doesn't cover your individual fingers, toes, teeth, and other various tiny bones. You could probably heal those, but in general the basic package is designed towards allowing the user to maintain basic mobility and function after severe trauma. In addition, you can opt-in to our experimental mesh implantation that wraps around any essential organs you'd like to keep or protect. We're not going to be liable for any damage from an experimental procedure, though, so if your organ gets squeezed into little cubes when you're trying to reassemble yourself...too bad, I guess.\"Rose hums. \"Anything else?...\" she asks herself. \"Oh yeah!

There's also a slight breeze in the hallway\u2014not enough to make a person feel chilly, but enough so that each breath of air is fresh and untainted.The clinic is somewhat organized, signs on walls or hanging from ceilings directing patients or nurses from room to room. The hallways are mostly clear of equipment, aside from a gurney or two, but there's a decent amount of traffic as mostly ordinary-looking humans push people around and into different areas of the hospital.

As you might have figured by now, we don't really have that much magical power to spare.\"The room opens up to a wide lab space, the floor completely tiled and the walls smoothed and painted over with a clean white paint.

Vats in different states of disassembly are in one corner, tables bearing beakers and tubes and what seem to be magically hot plates are in another, there are jars of flesh and other gleaming parts preserved in fluid around the room, and at the center there's what appears to be a young girl with blonde ponytail dismantling a mechanical contraption and tearing out the bits of flesh entangled within it.\"Hey Riley, we have a new assistant,\" Rose calls out. \"Come say hi, she's going to be filling about ten mage batteries for us.\"At that, Riley drops the flesh and metal in her hands and spins around on the bench, a joyous expression on her face.

Okay, so here are some things you can look out for, and keep in mind this isn't a comprehensive list and you can bring back whatever you think might be usable, like the skull of an ancient, humongous creature dwelling in the abyssal depths of the northern seas or something. So: obviously, anything related to healing, hope, light, long-lifespans, rejuvenation, fear of death, and so forth. Potent sources of magic are great, it doesn't matter if they're the first tears of an orphan or the concentrated blood of fifty unwilling virgins, they're all great sources of magic that could have interesting and potent effects. And finally, if you see anything really mutagenic or monstrous, like giant sea sponges that convert humans into giant sea sponges upon contact with their bodily fluids, grab those. Of course, be careful, but you do\u00a0get free healthcare as one of our employees. And anyways, besides all this, if there are some vague things like really anomalous or strange objects, either weird relative to the area its in or in general, like recently constructed statues made out of materials not native to the area that move when you're not looking at them, then grab those too. Oh, and try to make sure you get permission where needed when you're grabbing these things, or at least keep yourself untraceable, because I don't want a horde of people coming after me with lawsuits crying about how their bones were harvested at night or something.\"She hums. \"Mmm. That's about it, any questions?\"...\"Good luck too you too,\" Rose says, as a nurse comes by and collects the coins.She walks Indreni to the operating room, where Riley is eagerly waiting. After having Indreni lay down on a wide, flat, cushioned table in the middle of a glowing operating circle, she gives Indreni a sleeping pill and a cup of water to wash it down with. After Indreni falls asleep, Rose places the book from the previous room in a designated space on a nearby table, a small noise indicating a successful linkage. The circle begins spinning gently, shifting in color, as lines of nearly transparent script spiral from the circle to center onto Indreni.Riley scans the script, gently moving Indreni's limbs and reading the changes in the script, then nods and scribbles something into the area near Indreni's head. The script there ripple and rearranges, forming concentric circles that pulse in size and keep Indreni unconscious and pain-free.True to her word, the operation is quick and successful, with Riley making careful incisions and tapping the little gold spikes into Indreni's bones before sealing the wounds shut once more. The small cuts seal over and heal without any remaining marks, and Riley deems the operation a success as she drops her bloodstained gloves into a nearby cart and gestures to shut off the circle.With the circle powered down, Indreni is now free to awaken whenever she feels like it. She might be a little sore, but that feeling should fade soon enough.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Rose nods. \"The mom sounds fixable, depending on the specifics of her condition and to what lengths she's willing to go in order to have her own biological children.

She raised her wand in the air and focused on the five remaining batteries...But as soon as she felt how much more easily her mana flowed, she started to get cocky. She regretted not having the diligence virtue, since that would allow her to increase her powers drastically with the implants (Diligence allows one to buff one's powers with holy magic). However, she did have the chastity virtue, which meant she could summon a portion of the celestial realm. Theoretically her implants would resonate with the energies of that realm, increasing her powers.She waved her wand in the air. A bright light began to shine and a calming aura permeated the entire room. Rose might feel a strange, ghostly presence all around them. But unlike typical ghostly presences it would feel rather pleasant and amicable, like having loved ones in the room without them actually being there. Around 50 or so spots on her body began to glow. Then she waved her wand again.The room itself might start to shake a bit as a glowing aura appeared around all the batteries that were still empty. Not just the five obligatory ones, but ALL of them. Using the power of the Charity virtue, Indreni was \"buffing\" the batteries with an empowering spell, which was causing them to fill up. Indreni got even more excited and the auras would suddenly erupt into white flames. A gleeful smile would crease her face as battery after battery came back to life over the course of a few minutes. Five, seven, nine batteries, twelve batteries... She was feeling awfully proud of herself!But then, without warning, the celestial realm would suddenly dissipate. Indreni would be struck with disappointment and fear as the thirteenth battery stopped glowing. Her implants stopped glowing, everything stopped happening and Indreni would suddenly feel weak. She was fine however, even as she staggered around the circle. Finally she placed her hands on her knees to steady herself and started gasping for breath.\"Oh dear... this is why I never earned the Humility virtue. I was too proud of my new powers and I offended the celestial realm.

When full, they would be the color that best suited the person charging the batteries, tinted slightly by the nature of the spell they used to fill them with.When the lights finally faded and the 12 batteries were charged, Rose began chuckling while Riley just gaped.\"That... is definitely more than we bargained for,\" Rose began, a toothy grin on her face. \"I think we'll really\u00a0enjoy working with you.\" She looked Indreni over for a moment. \"Interesting, though... your implants resonated more with you, which meant your personal magic was stronger for all applications of your power in general?

It shouldn't be too hard to learn how to do, especially for someone as powerful as you, as long as you have a decent grasp on the fabric of reality and know how to do or fudge the mathematical calculations for opening a rift that's stable and fixed in place at a specific location on this planet. And maybe make sure you deal with the matter existing in the space before you tear open the hole, however you want, or else it just kind of fizzles. Oh, and you should find a way to siphon off a portion of your magic to constantly sustain another space outside of this reality.\"Rose leans in. \"If you do end up learning, keep it secret, please. It took a bit of work in obtaining the theoretical basis for this spell, and the owner didn't give up their knowledge easily. I'm sure someone else has figured out this spell before, but I'd still rather it not getting around. It's just a little too\u00a0useful, you see.\"She leans back. \"Anyways, otherwise the main limitation of the spell is that it scales exponentially in terms of mana cost depending on the duration of the spell, the size of the tear, the size of the objects you're pulling out or pushing in, the identity or concept of self the objects you're storing or taking out has, the size of the other dimension you're storing things in, and the fact that for now, the spell is kind of an omni-directional hole in reality rather than a flat plane. We're working on efficiency improvements and possibly making it directional, but for now you're probably not going to be able to store large living things or highly unique objects without incurring a very high mana cost. You can\u00a0open large rifts for fractions of a second to intercept anything coming your way, but that relies on your reflexes or an intelligent automated detection system so you don't collapse of mana exhaustion when someone throws a squirrel at you. Actually, maybe you\u00a0could take a few squirrels. Oh yeah, and the inside of the rift starts as an extremely cold vacuum, so you'll probably need to fill it with something or else it'll start sucking things in, and you'll also need to work on managing the simultaneous ejection of air or whatever fluid you put in there during the evacuation of whatever you're taking out.\"Rose pauses and clear her throat, glancing at a nearby timekeeping device. \"Er, anyways, yeah, so probably not too useful to you for now, especially if you're fine with carrying a pack or something.

But you know, I just grabbed a spare from my stash since the old arm was a bit mangled, popped it back on, and I should be perfectly fine once everything links up again.\"She also curls her bicep and poses, then lets her form collapse with a chuckle. \"Not to shabby in the strength department either, if I may say so myself.\"Rose waves off her worries about eating. \"As long as you're not eating, say, magically-reactive metals or something, then you'll be fine. With our techniques, you won't have to worry about getting vomit in your lungs or anything like that.\"\"As for your offer...\" Rose pauses to think. \"Well, I do have a couple of employees who have expressed a desire to, you know, get out there and explore new places.

It's bad for business if you're seen as anything but. You realize that I won't be able to take anything too politically sensitive, yes? Healing the son of a major political figure, sure, because I'm not going to inflate prices just because the customer is more wealthy, but using my techniques to warp a prisoner's mind into an open book is probably a no-no, at least in terms of politics.\"She shrugs, going back to the book in front of her. \"But yes, I suppose we should see if I can heal him, first.

At the same time a warm, soothing aura would flow into the room, affecting everyone, particular Uglu. The boy would start giggling and laughing.

Not only does it work, it also sounds quite pleasant to the ear.\" She eyes the instruments. \"Are those enchanted or something? I kind of want to go get someone to buy those and play soothing music to patients as they wait, even better if they learn some light healing magic to go with it.

She has to move aside some of Uglu's clothing to expose places like his armpit, but most of her work is focused around his neck area. The needles slide in and out at a rapid pace, vials are mixed and stirred, incantations are cast, and slightly glowing fluid is injected back into Uglu.The work is greatly helped along by Riley's mechanical spiders that seem to know exactly what to do, injecting or examining after every step as they crawl over Uglu's body. They don't leave a single mark on his skin as they skitter along, and after their jobs are done they crawl back onto Riley, their bodies flattening as they do so. They eventually disappear underneath her clothing without a trace.Half an hour passes. Riley shuts down the diagnostic circle, sends a summon for Rose through the glowing tablet, and waits for them to arrive. Once Sangilak gets back, she allows the woman awaken Uglu by herself.

The walls had finally been completely painted, the surfaces now a smooth and sterile white. Gaps in the old stonework had been smoothed and filed in with cement, then covered with a fresh layer of paint. The floor had been tiled with white, soft and slightly springy tiles, providing decent traction while also being shiny and clean. Even more mage lights now shine from the ceiling, providing an even source of lighting for the entire room.There are couches lining the walls along with padded chairs, a few low tables also present. A curved reception desk sits at the front of the room, a hallway to the side of it leading deeper into the building and a closed door marked \"STAFF ONLY\" behind the desk.\"So this is the waiting room,\" Rose explains. \"Not very full most of the time, as we usually process patients very quickly and get them seen to right away. Still, it always makes people feel better when the place actually looks like a hospital. Or well, I mean, I like it.\"A small, blonde, and blue-eyed girl bursts through the STAFF ONLY door in the back, dressed in a white coat splattered with fresh bloodstains over what seems to be the official, conservative nurse's uniform for this clinic.

So yeah? Maybe?\" Rose looks inquiringly at Tristian....Technology it is, then. Rose led Tristian back through the STAFF ONLY door, Riley following close behind.\"So, uh, I would appreciate it if you didn't just tell everyone about our technology,\" Rose says as she walks down the hallways. \"In addition, please keep anything you see about the patients confidential. Of course, if you need to tell your people about necessary information to make a trade, that's fine, but I would like it if you briefed me beforehand on what information you would reveal.\"The hallways have the occasional nurse walking past quickly or pushing patients on gurneys. They glance Tristian with surprised expressions before nodding at Rose and moving on. Rose, for her part, seems to assure the nurses that nothing is out of the ordinary with a quick smile and a gesture.There isn't really anything too abnormal to be seen, as most of the patients are either sedated or out cold. However, their little group does pass by a patient with his skin covered in rotting sores. Plates of black, reforming ichor move across his body and expose bleeding and pungent flesh, causing the man to moan softly and twitch against his restraints. As they pass by, the nurse for the patient taps at one of the onyx plates, noting the sudden hardness and writing something on his notepad.\"He has some kind of magic-resistant flesh-rotting disease,\" Rose explains. \"We've gone through a lot of less invasive procedures in an attempt to fix it, but we've had no luck, as it seems to be tied to his being. So instead, we attempted to start replacing his skin and flesh with materials incapable of rotting, but now the disease seems to be fighting back\u2014quite ingenuously, too. We believe it's starting to wrest control of the skin replacement from him.\" She shrugs. \"Needs tweaking, but I do think we're getting somewhere.\"Eventually, they get to a large, metal door labeled STAFF ONLY in bold red lettering. Rose places a hand on the door, where a series of concentric circles intersecting with swirling script appear. \"A security precaution,\" Rose comments, as the door parts down the middle and slides open.The room is cool and dry inside. If Tristian is observant, he'll see that Riley's breath fogs the air, but nothing comes out of Rose's mouth as she turns to a metal plate on the wall and slides her fingers across it. The door slides shut behind them.The mage lights lining the ceiling come to life, bringing the rows of glass vats into stark relief. Inside of each are what seems to be people suspended in almost-clear bluish fluid, although some of the figures are hardly recognizable due to their nonconformity with standard body plans. None of them are moving, all of them seemingly in a state of suspended animation.\"This is our cold storage,\" Riley pipes up. \"Sometimes we have patients whos' augmentations or treatments really\u00a0don't agree with them, like...\" She skips ahead to one of the vats and taps on it. \"This one.\"The man seems normal, until one takes a closer look at his head. The skull is bulging quite grotesquely, the bone beneath the skin visible as what seems to be his brain emerges from the back of his skull.\"So... something weird happened when we were reviving him from brain death,\" Riley continues. \"See those little strings back there and the bulge along his spine?\" She points toward those areas. \"Something possessed his, um, brain\u2014we think\u2014and his nerves started devouring his body while also removing themselves from his flesh.\"And indeed, it seems that while the man's face is expressionless, his body is atrophied and small tendrils are in the process of emerging from holes in his skin.\"So yeah, that was pretty weird, even for me.\" Riley giggles. \"We decided to drop him in here so his family could see what happened to him before we do anything else.\" She pouts. \"I think they've been ignoring our messengers, actually, but maybe they'll come see him one day. And then I'll finally be able to work on him.\"Rose looks at Tristian. \"I know it seems kind of morbid,\" she says, \"but really, I'm sure you could find a use for this technology. You could store terminally ill people for transport or drop a severely wounded soldier into one of these before bringing him back to a hospital. People with incurable illnesses can be stored until treatments are found, and actually, we have quite a few rich old people who want to be stored indefinitely until they can be revived to restored to youthfulness.\" Rose snorts. \"Some of them actually send their children on quests for the Fountain of Youth or stuff like that. They just tell their children that 'the quest for eternal youth has been passed down for generations and they aren't a true Renard if they don't take part in this tradition'. And then when the children have gone off on their adventures they pop themselves in here and wait.\" She shrugs. \"Well, they are\u00a0paying and helping to keep this place up and running, so who am I to complain?\"\"Anyways, so what do you think? Anything else you want to see? We have more examples of our technology if you'd like to see more. And the patient wards are just around the corner\u2014although not literally, we'll have to take the elevator to the second floor if you want to see our more interesting cases. Oh!

Whether that's their body stores of energy, their own mana pool, their very soul, or a mixture of the aforementioned or perhaps even more exotic things, it doesn't matter as long as they can pay a price. So, with that being said, I have a wide array of options for soldiers that are normal, healthy, athletic humans. We can give them a tune up of their systems, make their body function more efficiently, and do other things like increasing their sense of smell or lowering their sense of pain. In general, those augmentations will give them a decent base strength increase and a pretty good increase in endurance.\"She glances at her book. \"Our rates for basic things like that aren't very high, as there aren't any precious reagents being consumed in the process. However, if you willing to pay more, we our options broaden even further. Things like increasing their body's durability by systematically replacing their fluids, bones, muscles, and skin, creating redundant organs in their body, replacing eyes and other sensory organs with more durable, sensitive, or perhaps even magical models\"\u2014Riley waves\u2014\"are all doable. Still, by our standards, these upgrades are relatively tame.\"\"See, what I like are things that basically make people inhuman,\" Riley says. \"Unfortunately, without a strong individual to work with, a lot of these augments can go awry. Still, if you give me a patient with, um, say, an innate affinity with magic, we can give them augmentations that will allow them to pull themselves back together even after being separated into chunks, so long as their brain is intact. Give me someone with immense mental fortitude and I can give them bodies that can be controlled to rearrange themselves into different forms and shapes. I can give them bone spurs and blades hidden in their forearms, poison sacs, organs that produce electricity, or a body that will constantly regenerate and heal no matter how injured the person is. But if the individual in question is unable to withstand his augmentations...\" Riley shrugs. \"Broken minds are kinda hard to fix.\"\"We could go on and on,\" Rose says, \"But now that we've given you some examples, is there anything you feel as though your soldiers might be interested in?

I am part of a coalition of elves who help protect the Land-Tiller's Expanse. My servants are members of a clan of humans called the Sodalites. Please forgive them. Their psionic abilities may have inadvertently breached your facility's privacy. I can assure you this will not happen again. Hmm, let me see here.\"She pulled out a scroll with some notes she had taken. \"Ah, first of all, Sangilak of the Saskatoon would once again like to extend her thanks for curing her adopted son Uglu. He is doing quite well and is much more active and playful than he once was. As the elder of the Saskatoon clan, she'd like to formerly extend her clan's hand in friendship to you and your employees. You are welcome anytime. Second of all, on behalf of Elder Havador, we would like to invite you to establish a clinic in our lands if you so wish, something which I would like to discuss the terms of with you.\"There is a moment of silence while Alanis gathers her thoughts. \"This is a somewhat delicate situation. You see, there are different opinions amongst the elders as to what sort of services your clinic should be allowed to conduct in our lands. Some want to grant you total freedom in all your ways, including experimentation. No strings attached. Others only want to allow healing services and are still greatly suspicious of your magicks... There are at least a handful that are interesting in the... military applications... of your flesh-crafting...\" Alanis said this with some disdain.\"Still, it's a general consensus that our people want to extend some sort of hand of friendship with your people. Before we continue, what are your thoughts on this matter?\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Alanis chuckled at Riley's response to the word \"psionics.\" She said, \"The world is full of all kinds of interesting people and abilities. I imagine it must be frustrating having to continually adapt your defenses to them. It was much easier for us elves to hide from the Land-Tillers. We weren't interesting enough for them to wanna see what we're up to! But that's a story for another time. Thank you for your hospitality.\""}, "post-41689": {"user": "Rose", "user_num": 277, "timestamp": "1466295579000", "message": "Rose tilted her head at the humans curiously and returned their polite smile. \"It's alright,\" Rose says. \"It was an accident, and if they don't spill any secrets, well, no harm done and all that.\"She stares intently at them. \"I'd, uh, love to...examine them, though. Consensually, of course, haha, and they'll be paid for their time.\"\"Oh, that's good to hear,\" Rose says happily. \"I'm glad Uglu is doing well. Riley, you hear tha\u2014oh darnit, she ran off again. Well, I'll be sure to tell her the good news.\"Rose taps her lips thoughtfully at her question. \"While I'd like to be able to run experiments with mostly willing volunteers, I understand that's a very controversial issue. I think that I'll restrict myself to just providing healing services to avoid provoking further conflict amongst your elders. And, well, if any interesting patients come my way, I'll be getting some great data from treating them anyways!\"\"Still, I see that you're not in favor of the more, um, violent applications of our craft?\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Rose tilted her head at the humans curiously and returned their polite smile.

It would be at least somewhat apparent they were not in favor of the idea, with the exception of one of two adventurous young volunteers.\"Well, to be honest, it has a lot to do with the land-tiller's recent foray into the outside world. We elves have watched over them for many generations. But to an extent we've also observed the happenings of the outside. And many of us have reservations about the humans suddenly forming ties with other civilizations. We understand it's inevitable. Humans are naturally drawn to each other and it is their way. We take our long life spans for granted and forget how important it is to experience as much of life as possible when one's years here are limited... something I sense you'll want to bear in mind, centuries from now.\" Alanis winked.\"The land-tillers want to protect themselves. They want to assert their place among these other peoples. This will lead to conflicts. Of that I am certain. And so I must concede that the more violent applications of your craft will appeal to them after some time. I personally do not agree with it, no, but I cannot prevent the other elders from taking an interest.\"Alanis held up a free hand into the air. A soft white light emanated from a small point floating inches above her palm. \"You may not know this, but there was a civil war in the expanse about 50 years ago. We elves had to watch in horror as the humans faced the consequences of elitism. There were those gifted in the ways of magic who felt they were superior to others and should rule over them, necromancers in particular. During the war, a single powerful mage took the side of the magic-less humans and waged war against the necromancers and wiped them out. She saved the expanse. And since then magical and non-magical humans have gotten along quite well. But there is still some... tension. Magic affords us with advantages that powerless people simply don't have. A peasant's life is no more or less valuable than a mage's, but in battle one gets treated like a god, and the other like fodder. Even I agree this is unfair.\"Alanis closed her hand, causing the light to disappear. \"You may have something that can change that. The elders believe that... physical augmentation... will not only allow for the diversification of troops, but also serve as an equalizer so that those who do not have magic can be seen as just as valuable. Not only that, but most of the land-tiller humans are peaceful and do not wish to see combat in person, and so having physically augmented troops may allow the expanse to utilize small groups of elite forces rather than large armies. This would also mean less resources and loss of life during military conflict. Once again, I do not necessarily agree with any of this. I believe this may result in a foolish arms race. However, I am understanding of the concerns of the humans.\"Alanis sighed. \"Once again, what are your thoughts on this matter?\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The odd attendants all looked towards Alanis, who remained silent on the matter of the Sodalites being examined.

Maybe she could get them alone and ask them later...\"...Of course,\" Rose says somewhat cautiously. \"I won't take it for granted, and I'll keep that in mind.\" She smiles. \"But as long as there are interesting things in this world, I don't think I'll ever stop and stagnate.\"After Alanis finishes speaking of violence and equality, Rose takes a moment to think.\"My goal, personally, is to continue to experiment, adapt, and improve upon upon my craft and my creations,\" Rose begins. \"That being said, I understand the benefits of maintaining the status quo, despite the nature of my work. It would not be beneficial to me if a potential customer's country collapsed overnight, nor if my customer's were unable to properly maintain and control my creations and collapsed their own society.\"\"But...if I attempted to play favorites, dictate which country received which services, that would make many people very unhappy. So, I will remain impartial\u2014mostly. Genocide and similar things are a no-no. But otherwise, if someone can pay for my services and/or their situation intrigues me, then I'll provide treatment or augmentation.\"\"So, I suppose, what I'm trying to get at here is that if they can agree, as a group, to what they want from me, then I'll provide it. Whether it's just medical treatment, or if they want me to combine four people into a bulky, medium-sized tank unit for the battlefield, I'll do it.\"Rose shrugs and leans forward, grabbing a fried mealworm and popping it into her mouth. After chewing, swallowing, and gathering her thoughts, she speaks again. \"But if you want my personal thoughts... I believe the world is in a constant state of change. Whether it's new borders, weapons, or forms of magic, I think that an arms race is inevitable and, actually, already currently ongoing. As you've told me, it seems that your state is expanding and keen on carving out a place for themselves in the politics of this land. Even if, say, I refuse to provide them with augmented soldiers and medical treatment, they'll find their military power from somewhere else. Maybe someone will sell them a formula for a new kind of chemical weaponry. Maybe they'll begin breeding exotic beasts for war machines and mounts. In the end, whether I help or not, they'll find their weapons and go to war. It's human nature.\"\"Or maybe I'm wrong, who knows,\" Rose says, chuckling. \"For your inequality issue between the mages and the normal humans, maybe my kind of augmentations will help even those two out. I'd have to know the capabilities of your average mage, though, in order to make them truly equal. But having elite squads fight for those who are not willing to does seem like it would lead to the most preservation of life. Sounds interesting, I'm definitely down to do it. Using soldiers as fodder is massive waste of potential, anyways.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Rose had to fight a grin upon seeing that she possibly had two volunteers.

Humans are dominated by emotions, and this includes fear and pride. There is nothing wrong with this of course but...\"Alanis fell silent and closed her eyes for a moment.\"Well, the fact of the matter is that the elders have not placed any unreasonable limits on the opening of your new branch. There are only two. Firstly, no non-consensual experimentation on anyone, not even criminals. Secondly, you must provide healing services freely to those who are critically injured or on the verge of death. These services can be subsidized if you so wish, but these stipulations are non-negotiable. With that said, you may open your clinic at any time or anywhere in the Expanse.\"Alanis and her attendants brought out several scrolls giving Rose more detailed information about the culture and moral values of the people of the Expanse, and their laws. There was nothing particularly extreme about them. Land-Tillers valued the protection of life and of the earth itself above all things. They were a generally peaceful people, though a warrior's spirit was not uncommon. They were well-educated in medicine, agriculture and ecology, but relatively primitive in terms of industry and metallurgy. They relied heavily on magic, mounted animals, and archery for combat. They were generally accepting of other cultures and races, believed in the pricinple of balance, and favored an afterlife of reincarnation.In other words, so long as Rose didn't do anything overtly evil, she and her companions would be well-treated and accepted.With the talks over, if Rose had no other questions, Alanis would thank Rose for her hospitality and she and her attendants would leave.

Nothing overtly evil, easy. She would agree to the treatment of any emergency cases, but would ask them to help pay for anything that might be a little too costly, like fixing a multi-layered curse cast by a dying breath of a loving mother o-or something like that haha.Anyways, Rose looked forward to setting up a branch in the Expanse.\"We've got everything prepared and ready to go,\" Rose says, excited. \"We started planning immediately after talking with Sangilak. And now that we've got the ability to utilize teleportation, we can get a temporary clinic set up very quickly\u2014even more so if you have a large, spacious building we can reside in instead of having to build a building for ourselves.
