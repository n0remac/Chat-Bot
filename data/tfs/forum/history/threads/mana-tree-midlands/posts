Oh! The power emitted from the large tree in the center of the clearing, surrounded by the clean water of the river... It was drawing her forth. The dark woman approached with her awestruck gaze; she had never encountered the likes of such a tree in her life.As she neared the plant, she reached out with hesitation. Her fingers grazed the bark ever so gently and she whispered, \u201cWhat are you?\u201d The feeling of tingles radiated from her fingertips up into her arms. Her hand flattened against the trunk and she closed her eyes.She knew, though, that she could not stay in such a place yet, for her journey was not over and she still had a way to go, right? When she opened her eyes, it was with a wistful look at the plant in question. Her hand dropped reluctantly to her side and her shoulders squared. If only she could stay just a little bit longer....But in keeping with her journey, she decided she would bank this place in her memory... For now, her feet would propel her further North in search of that ever elusive floating island.<exit>", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<enter from the meadow>"}}
