The vessel he was on, was of course, the finest and most luxurious of the small fleet of twenty of so ships. It was comprised of mostly women and children with the bare minimum of sailors, just enough to man the ships. Quintus had chosen to lead these people to safer pastures, or at least that's how he rationalized it in his head. In reality he had simple fled his warring homelands, unable to deal with the pressure or the hardships of wartime as one of the country's few remaining figures of the past regime.\u00a0Somehow Quintus had been wash ashore, that much he was painfully aware of, but how he had got there or any of the events of the past day he found himself unable to recall.
