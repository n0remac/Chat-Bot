Despite the disrepair, the ruins are absolutely steeped in violent and uncontrollable mana.  Uncontrolled exposure to it has a number of deleterious effects, the most notable being a permanent resistance to healing magic.  Early on, we tried to use mages to explore, but the ambient mana has strange, chaotic properties.  One of the mages died on the first day, and we decided to try a different approach.\"She lifts a heavy looking block of lead.\"This was our solution.  These blocks are imbued with a runic matrix that soaks up mana from the body.  The local magic, instead of slowly seeping into your flesh, and melting you from within, is harmlessly soaked into this block.  Pay attention to it, though.  If it soaks too much, it starts to get hot.  If it goes too far, you're covered in molten metal, and no longer have a protective ward.\"Next, she lifts up a chain, also made of lead.  It has ten links.\"Now, besides the initial insulation against ambient magic, We also issue these.  Each link is imbued with a different ward, each with a different threshold.  The big block is useless against more directed magical attack.  These wards serve to siphon off large quantities of magical energy in one go.  Hang them somewhere where you're not touching them.  They're only good for one go before they melt.  My fist trip, I burned through all of my links, and decided to go just a bit further.  Big mistake.  Five feet in, there was a trap.  It burned off my arm.  Five inches difference, and it would have been my head.  On the way back, I learned that there were traps I hadn't triggered on the way in.  You have ten links.  If you have less than three, run for the exit.\"She sets down the chain and picks up a bundle of cords, each of a different color.  \"Lastly, as an explorer, you are expected to exercise proper preparation for those who come after you.  When you're in the ruins, the red rope means death.  If you see it hanging from something, it means that there's a trap there, or something that will kill you.  Don't touch it, and you'll be fine.  You'll also have your own length of the red to mark the your own missteps.  The green means that the area is safe.  Don't step outside of it, unless you're ready to take some risks.  The yellow marks an area that is in active exploration.  There  might be unmarked traps, but it's second safest, after green.  The last color is orange.  It signifies a section that is only partially explored.  You will be given a length of orange rope.  Your procedure will be to tie down your rope to the edge of one of the green or yellow areas, and then head into an unexplored area.  As you find traps or malfunctioning artifacts, mark them with the red.  When you decide to turn back, leave the rope where it is, and follow it back.  If you found something that looks small or safe enough to be safely carried, do bring it back with you.
