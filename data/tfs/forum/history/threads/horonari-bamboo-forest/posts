His bag weighed heavy on his shoulders, filled with incense sticks, coins, prayer beads and wooden sutra scrolls. The contents of the bag rattled with the pattering of his feet, in an almost musical rhythm. His head was hot under a wide brimmed straw hat.  His robes clung to the sweat on his skin, as he continued the pilgrimage. Finally, he came to a spot where the hill leveled off. Someone had mercifully placed a stone bench there for travelers to rest on, before the next flight of stairs.Junrei sat down, and slipped his hickory carved training sword from his rope belt. He leaned on it, catching his breath. His head turned to the sound of footsteps from the wall of bamboo behind him.\"If you're a highwayman or a beggar, I only have a few stale rice cakes,\" he said, without turning around.The reply came in the form of hissing steel. Junrei let out a sigh. The gods must have a cruel sense of humor to send so many aspiring swordsman to their deaths. Here was another upstart, eager to prove himself against Junrei, he guessed. The man forced himself up and turned around to see a fresh faced youth in crisp black robes stare back. A family mon or crest, was emblazoned onto the robe, but Junrei didn't recognize it.\"Niten D\u014draku,\" the youth said, referring to the religious name by which Junrei was sometimes known. \"I have studied your Two Heavens as One Style my entire life.\"\"Did you?\" Junrei replied, suppressing a smile.  By his guess, the boy's entire life was less than eighteen years.\"I heard of your pilgrimage. I sought you out that I might test my skill against the founder of Two Heavens.\"Junrei noticed that the boy did indeed have a gleaming katana in one hand and wakizashi short sword in the other. Not many attempted to fight with two weapons. Too many practiced Junrei's style for the wrong reasons - to stand out amongst their peers, who overwhelmingly favored a single sword in combat.\"I've a long day ahead of me young one,\" Junrei said. \"Let's make this quick.\"Junrei raised his wooden sword up in a guard stance.\"A single wooden sword against my metal? Do you not practice your own style anymore?\" the boy asked incredulously.\"Nah, to be honest, I got kind of bored with it.\"The youth's face reddened. All that practice to impress the founder of Two Heavens, and he disregards it!\"Niten D\u014draku, I challenge you on behalf of the Sasaki clan. First to get knocked down loses. Do you accept?\"\"Challenge accepted,\" Junrei managed to say with a straight face.The boy charged Junrei. As he came at him, the swordsman appraised his technique. The stride was well paced and balanced. The grip on his weapons just right. His eyes squinting and unblinking. Given a few more years, he could become a competent, if orthodox swordsman. The boy threw his whole weight into an all-or-nothing lunge, pulling his katana arm as back as it could go for one strong swing.  Not bad, Junrei thought, potentially lethal. Before the blade could follow through, Junrei snapped his sword arm forward, the hickory blade landing between the boy's eyes, just powerfully enough not to bruise - maybe.Junrei kept repeating his overhead swing, rapping the younger man's head repeatedly, until he started to scream for mercy, tears forming in the corner of his eyes. The katana and wakizashi rolled out of his grip. He raised his hands to his face, and Junrei stepped back. Most of the damage was to the youth's pride, but the raps would smart for awhile.\"You had no style, no technique,\" he managed to mutter. \"No strategy. Are you really Junrei?\"\"Here's the thing, strategy is overrated,\" Junrei replied.The boy looked up at Junrei dumbfounded by what he heard. Junrei pulled out a small drinking gourd from his pack and tossed it to the boy. His personal motto \"Seishin Chokudo\" (earnest heart, straight way) was engraved in it. You should have passed a fresh stream on your way here. The cold water will help the stinging. Keep the gourd.\"With that, Junrei slipped his bag around his shoulders and resumed his way up the steps.
