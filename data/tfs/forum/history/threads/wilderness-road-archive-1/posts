These roads appeared to be endless! He'd walk down one, simply to find dozens of other roads; some made of dirt some (but far fewer) not; some difficult to spot, some he could easily trail in the darkest of nights. He'd been denying this fact to himself for quite a while... but he had to now face the truth:He was completely lost...He looked up at the sky which was partially concealed by the thick vegetation. A deep sigh was let out, and he slid a single hand through his white locks trying to keep himself calm and focused. Unable to stay calm, he'd immediately after groan ruffling his hair up with both his hands. He began spinning on his heel, looking around for anything that could send him in the direction of anything even remotely close to civilization. It was truly a conundrum. He had already climbed a tree a mile or two back and he failed to see anything but trees and maybe a... grr... road or two. Not a town, not a road-side inn, not another (clearly) intelligent being in sight.The shame that a (self-titled) master adventurer such as himself would get this lost was great. He grit his teeth and balled his hand into a fist! He wouldn't be defeated by a few, lousy, ill-made roads! He would\u00a0persevere through sheer determination!\u00a0He took a deep breathe, closed his eyes, spun on his heel... one... two... three times! His eyes opened, and he pointed forward filled with certainty in his own abilities!...he'd end up pointing in the exact same direction he had previously been walking.He briefly stumbled back at the thought of pursuing a road that had yet given him results... but he supposed that if someone had taken the time to build it had to lead somewhere. He huffed, and continued on his way, the way he pointed was a good direction he was sure of it.March! March! March!", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "March! March!

Somehow, possibly as a result of Keph's infamous luck, he did in fact find something! Although, the question was now if it was something he even wanted to really be a part of.He saw what appeared to be a merchant's caravan stopped in the middle of the road! Of course, the first question to pop up in his head was: why? They clearly hadn't setup camp, the animals appeared to all be under control, and their carriage appeared totally intact. Although, he did see some figures on the carriage, which appeared to not be very happy about something, seeing as they were preparing their weapons. He couldn't quite see what was in front of the carriage, but it was large enough that he was at least aware that something was there.Keph quickly slid behind a tree, and used the heavy vegetation on the sides of the road to conceal the fact that he was there. He pulled his cloak's hood over his head, concealing his snow white hair, which would've otherwise made him easily spotted. He began moving closer, making sure to always stay behind a tree to further conceal him and be used as cover if that archer noticed him - although he had his doubts that he would; he was far too good at the art of stealth for such... that and him being distracted no doubt helped a bit... (probably quite a lot, actually). However, cloak's Earthen color also played its part, not only hiding the out-of-place color of his hair but further allowing him to sink in with the surrounding, making him more difficult to spot next to the brown bark and the patches of dirt which he threaded on.Soon, he got close enough! His eyes still occasionally fluttered over to the caravan, making sure they were still distracted, but now he was far more interested in what had left them all so nervous. What he saw was a fairly massive figure, one that certainly beat him in height - being only 5'2 himself. He stood surprisingly still, at first Keph had even confused him for one of those empty suits of armor that some fancy noblemen covered their hallways in. However, he doubted the caravan guards would get so nervous over a thing like that... and more importantly there was certainly no base holding the suit of armor up. Even so, if the carriage weren't there, his first instinct would've probably been to poke it with a stick.The fact that the figure was not only a massive 7 feet tall but able to hold up such a heavy weapon did nothing but annoying Keph, causing to huff in discontent and tell himself that he too could wield such a weapon with just a few days of practice... this was of course unlikely to be true at all.His hands stayed at the read to pull out one of his weapons and more importantly run if the situation called for it.

But he could should it only be the two... The bow clattered softly against a tree truck--- the flesh seemed to pause---- He had been careless! STRIKE! --- No... No.. they did not hear him...

That is truly the most audacious and exciting adventure I have heard of. In the stories, such desires are often met with unexpected sorrow and consequences. What drives you to such an end? I cannot comprehend but I wish I could partake in such an adventure. Yet I fear that my stepfather will never release me. As soon as I am wed the king will have committed his only wagger for the throne. He has begotten no children from my mother yet, therefore he has no heir to the throne other than his hold on me. Until his own sons are born I will be passed from suitor to suitor in order to make the lords think that I might be given to one of them. I cannot actually be wed to anyone for then that house would have a chance of putting their own children onto the throne through me. As you can see I am put a piece on a board to all concerned. You speak of a remedy, but unless you have an army to take over an entire nation it would not be possible. Even then, I would not wish for such a war. Better that I live a captive then let the entire nation suffer for my freedom. The tales of your exploits will be enough to keep me happy.Gorian is part of an island chain to the west of Isra. The trip would only take a few days. If you do send a letter of courtship you must convince my father of its authenticity. He reads everything that is sent to me. Please tell me more about your adventures. Do you now rule over the lands that you have conquered? What were the battles like that you fought in? My father will be intrigued by such details.

I do not need to wish to live forever, for when the body dies, the soul simply enters the land of the fae, and when it finds it's anointed time and place, it too returns to the land of the living, and the cycle continues. What I wish to make immortal is my deeds, for though this body may die, my name will last forever, granting immortality to this name.\u00a0<br/><br/>I have conquered many men, but I rule no Kingdom. I have found many opportunities to find a hill and build myself a sturdy house surrounded by high walls, but that would be the cowardly way to live, tied to a single place, losing all my freedom of movement to protect some peasants and cattle. I find it a much better life to taste the foods and drink the water of many lands, so to not grow complacent in one.\u00a0<br/><br/>Enclosed in this letter will be a torc, a sign of my people that I wish to begin my courtship of you. The torc itself is from one of my many battles and conquests. In the rolling hills of Toragana, there was a mighty giant that had claimed the hill fort of one of the lords of Toragana, wishing to add it to the many it already had under its control. The giant waged a great war upon the lord, slaying all his band of warriors with a trunk of tree it used as a club. The lord called upon me and my war band to come and save his people, and we arrived at the fort as the beast beat at the gates with its trunk. I called upon the beast to face me on the open field, in a test of champions. The beast agreed, and we joined battle. The beast was strong, but I was quicker, and for every blow it tried to lash at me, I delivered two that landed with my axe. Finally the beast lay dead on the field, and I claimed its torc that it had previously stolen from a defeated lord.<br/><br/>Yours Truly,<br/>Annan Ap Owen<br/><br/>P. S.

He instinctively frisked himself before diving into one of his pockets his fingers touching his ring - but why his hand had dived he was unsure. It was clear to him that they were not getting 'that'. \"I do appreciate the advice, but my culture is not something to be put into an object that can be gifted away. Would they not consider gold?

That place is said to be a dung heap where one is bare able to sustain one's living.\" Vithkun said and remembered back on what he was told about that place. Not that drows lived very fancily but that place was where the lowest of the drows were said to be driven to. Those with no land, money or honor. He wasn't sure if he wanted to know much more but did slowly wrench the words out. \"Hooow... did you end up there..?\" he asked skeptically though feeling some amount of pity towards Myra, though the place itself filled him with contempt for the ways the drows had build their culture. Surely with the prowess of elves - even the drows - no one had to live like that. Unfortunately the drows had cast aside their elven honor centuries ago and even though they still had visual similarities with the pure elves Vithkun doubted they would ever be able to atone in a way so the gods would smile upon them again. \"It's not exactly High Haven, but it will do I suppose.\" Vithkun said inspecting the place and sighed longing a little for his home. Water nearby would satisfy their basic needs but to him it seemed there was little chance for an ambush at this place and he reckoned they could relax. Motioning his horse to a stop the wind would slowly settle and bring him down before it vanished. Vithkun nodded as Myra left to get some wood for a fire as he took a medium sized sachel from his luggage from which he drew out a very thin piece of cloth. It was almost translucent in nature, though the elaborate curly drawings in gold and silver seemed to bind it together inside the purple/blue cloth despite it's thin texture. The size of the sachel betrayed the vastness of the cloth as he folded it out, and with a quick inscription of his magic the cloth started forming what ended up being a quite reasonably sized tent a little taller than Vithkun and with little pointy spires to add to the height. Inside it was even more spacious than it looked from the outside and a small family would have ample room to stay there. As Vithkun entered he felt the warmness from High Haven radiate from the cloth and it seemed somewhat brighter and more welcoming inside than outside - such was the wonder of what the elves produced - though a tent like this was hardly something everyone owned. By extension the tent was very easy to overlook because it to some degree reflected the light behind it and not inside it making it seem like it was one with the nature. Furthermore the inside would isolate Vithkun effectively from most ambient sounds, though sounds of distress, aggression and footsteps outside would be amplified allowing one to sleep tightly without fear of being ambushed without knowing it beforehand.

However he would let that slight misunderstanding pass for now.\"I feel right at home.\" he said sarcastically in reference to the robe that was tied around him. It would be most difficult to break while tied up though as he wriggled slightly. It was a damn pity they found the ring and he didn't get to slip it on his finger first. It was useless in his pocket but could be put to use if he had it on his finger. He needed to convince them that it could just as well stay where it was, because if he claimed it was too important or unique to him, they would likely bring it with them as proof they had actually taken him hostage. \"If you want the reward I wouldn't take the ring!\" he suddenly exclaimed raising his clear voice. \"The ring is an ailment towards a curse that was brought upon me a few years ago. It is a substitute to the elven medicine and allows me to travel outside High Haven - trust me they won't pay for a corpse and I'll end up one and a matter of days without that.\" he argued to the best of his efforts.

His gaze lowered and so did his mood though he felt like he couldn't disappoint the girl that had come too see a 'real elf'. She recognized his splendor in a way that few had done before and though he felt somewhat like a zoo animal, he couldn't blame it on the girl at least. Well, only he himself had probably gotten him into this - his wisdom had failed when he had provoked those people and even when he thought it wise to leave by himself. \"Girl, if you ever get anyway near High Haven you will be my honored guest. As a matter a fact when you get old enough, go find it and I'll make a crown of the most beautiful flowers for you as a proper thank you for this gesture.\" Vithkun said feeling warm inside seeing that even among humans there existed such pure beings as this small girl who seemed as blessed as any elf.

Watching and listening she read peoples faces like a book and when he spoke of home she could not help but feel his own sadness. Wide eyes almost wild with his own grief she stretched through the bars and they gave slightly sensing her sincerity as a small hand cupped the side of his cheek. No words were needed for her to express all that she needed.\u00a0Withdrawing to break him off another piece of the granola he made an offer that made her smile so brightly her cheeks lit up with a blush of excitement. That was until a voice hollered in the distance, \"Bree!\" Glancing back behind her she squirmed slightly in place, if she was caught her when she had been told expressly not to come she would be in big trouble. Breaking off the last half of the treat she extended it to him a voice once again calling the name that was obviously the girls. Drawing back she could not help but take one last look at him even as she rushed off to the feminine voice calling her name. Myra was still perched in place and unable to see Vith from her current position. Moving around the barrier might allow her a glimpse at his location but it also put her in harms way. Being discovered by the sentries would pit her against more than she cared to tangle with. Her current spot allowed her an open view of the way they passed back and forth. She could use that, she stiffened at the thought, no, she couldn't, it was a forbidden magic for a reason. Making sure the courier was completely unconscious she would slip down. Having remained up there for a while she believed she had a solution after watching the local wildlife. She heard a woman calling a name out into the darkness and saw the lights dimming for the night. Risking patrolling now would be easier and she circled it until she saw a flash of flaxen hair in the distance. The great tree that Vith was kept in was some distance from the village and some from the barrier. Greatly exposed it was left in an area where it could be watched without much attention paid as there was not much by it. It would take at least a hundred yards to reach it in the barrier and there was still the problem of men walking around the outside occasionally. A few deep breaths and she stood tall and strong and reaching out passed through the barrier. Once she made entry, Vith's back to her, she would clasp the inside of her wrist and glance up to the sky. Clouds covered the moon and the stars but they were cumulus and the fluffy type that many pointed out shapes in. Even if they covered the moon its edges would still light them giving a silver lining that Vithkun might not see at the moment. Until he could not even see that. The world became dark to him as if his eyes were blind of sight the dim pale light once there had receded into a moonless night where even the stars refused to shine. Pitch black it felt suffocating against his skin as if he were being brushed with the darkness and it wanted to invade his lungs. Every breath might be his last until it wasn\u2019t. It cleared his sight returning but only to the edge of the cage until the shimmering of snowy hair came from beyond the bars. His vision released a few feet farther it was as if he were in a bubble of moonlight translucent edges keeping the reflection it within while the rest of the world was lost to him. The expanse at which she held this magic could not be kept long  but she would not need it but for the few moments it took to break him loose. Passing the trunk of the tree where the roots split out to keep him prisoner she circled around him and as she released his section drawing back the shade that surrounded him she would speak, \u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d as she stepped through the shield around him bending down on one knee as to be eye level.

Vithkun shook his head and smirked. \"Don't worry about me...\" he said as he heard a woman calling out to the girl. \"... I'll be fine and I'm sure you will too. \"Navear!\" Vith said and grinned. \"That's 'goodbye'. You better get moving so you don't get in trouble.\" he said seeing the girl run back towards towards her mother. Silence seemed to settle over the village the families retreating to their homes and Vithkun was left with his own thoughts. Trying to get out seemed a task he was not willing to undertake at the moment and quite frankly he needed to rest, his eyelids feeling increasingly heavy. However as the eyes closed for just a moment he saw in a flash a face he knew and woke up with a jolt.\"Myra..!\" he said and able to feel her presence and frantically looked around though he couldn't see her in any of the directions he was able to turn his head. But she was close, he could feel it, smell it and something inside him knew, that it was not a trick of the mind or the aftermath of a realistic dream. But something felt off and the very slight light of the moon had faded and if he didn't know any better he would swear that the darkness of every little crevice was closing in on him - and it was happening fast - the sensation sadly not feeling at all like a dream. As the darkness nearly engulfed him he instinctively took a deep breath closing both mouth, nose and eyes fearing that the darkness be a hostile spell that would creep inside him and strangle his very being from within - but he even felt it on his skin and it was as if his pores could no longer breath through the thick darkness that had engulfed him. It was not long however before it seemingly withdrew and hearing a very family voice Vithkun released his breath and opened his eyes again seemingly able to see at least what was inside the cage and a little outside too. And surely there she was. \"Your spell compliments your skin.\" Vithkun said with a grin figuring it was likely hers. This was an awful opening line but the combination of surprise to see her and the otherworldly spell had put him slightly off. The truth was, that he was terribly relieved to see her and lots of feelings went through him figuring that she was putting herself in a lot of danger to save him - and had chosen to do so of free will. \"I... it's really good to see you Myra. They make great food here, but their accommodation is awful.\" he said and chuckled slightly. \"I was making some progress in the diplomatic way but I must confess this is much faster. Also I have a runner to catch...\" Vithkun said thinking he should easily be able to on Wind Strider. \"How will you dispel the magic barrier though? This elven village is seemingly still protected by many of their old barriers and the ones living here before was likely more akin to me than they were to you considering the magic.\" Vithkun said hoping she had prepared for that too - but then it struck him and he looked at her intensely. \"Myra, I have a ring in my right pocket. I can't reach it right now due to my bonds, but if you can get your arms inside the cage and grab it and put it on my finger I could certainly give it a shot dispelling this barrier.\" Vith said hoping she would comply with his plan.

He was a valuable chess piece on her board, certainly no longer a pawn but not the king to her own queen. Perhaps a knight, capable of unique movement and centered in the lore of legends. His plan had already occurred to her to attempt to reach through the bars. At least freeing his bindings might be sufficient if nothing else. She commented not on his words about the spell as bringing up its rather horrendous past would be poor talk for the short time they had. Besides her concentration could only last so long with the babbling brook before her that spoke so sweetly. \"The barrier is unique to the village, I watched for some time as birds flew in and out, deer walked past it without any regard for the nature of it. It was not until I spotted an eagle diving for a mouse that I discovered the essence of it.

Despite the pain she attempted once again to reach through only to have them collapse on her wrist and hold her in place. Her expression grew grim but she did not cry out. Drawing back it released her, \"It appears that I am not going to be able to free you in such a manner.\" Glancing behind her she could see through the pitch that surrounded them. No one yet had figured their way out here, after all it seemed only as if the clouds had covered all the light.

He came to the same conclusion that Vith feared, that he worked not alone. The bandits never worked alone either and Myra had left one just outside the barrier who she believed would be out for some time. Some time had passed since she entered, however, due to their conversation and now her searching for his belongings. The man was still bound but once he rolled off the edge of the tree and down to the bottom he was able to at least take to his feet and rather awkwardly hop towards the edge of the barrier.

This would most likely cause most to think the alarm was sounded because of fire. \"Go!\" Vithkun commanded Wind Strider, and putting its stormy hooves into the ground it burst forward in the general direction he had seen Myra sneak towards.

As if they had purposely been put there. But there nature of them frightened Vith. He turned towards Myra and shaped his lips as if to question her, but he already knew the answer and decided to let it pass.

Vith looked down feeling a sorrow burn through his chest feeling the magic signature being the same here as the one that touched his skin a few hours before. It was all strangled to death and he couldn't quite bring himself to understand that any elf - not even the drows - would wield such vile magic. \"Myra. Is this the recompense for the spell you used earlier?\" he asked firmly - the question being more of a scolding - still looking ahead on the clearing that had been siphoned by all life. He understood that she couldn't have done this lightly, but what exactly was going through her head to inflict such pain - both upon herself and this place? \"Why did you do this?\" he asked as he got off the horse. \"Yes, it is best we leave immediately. This is not a sight I want to look upon for longer then necessary.\" Vith said and couldn't hide his disgust as he packed his things in preparation to leave.

Never would she have purposefully have allowed such blatant openness towards another person to be shown and she would not have allowed herself to fall asleep with any other.

Obviously it was because she was there to lessen his discomfort at being in the cage, he might have never reacted so if she had simply been visiting, but something was nice about being wanted in that instant. When Vith had turned along the wrong trail it had been at her behest. Purposefully she had attempted to steer him around it but the later signs of her passing that she had not been aware of had drawn him in. The instant they passed into the clearing she awoke feeling the death around her. It suffocated her like the very spell that had been used invading her senses and cutting through her like a knife. Every nerve ending felt like it was alight a shiver running along her spine that she compressed into it not allowing the motion to be seen outwardly her hands removed from his chest and gripping the edges of her thighs her cloak bunching into them. Following Vith off of the horse she slid off without his assistance not asking for it as he began to treat her rather like a child who had been naughty. His scolding was not beyond her understanding for she heard that tone often as a little girl who had been caught pick pocketing. What did he want from her? To say she was sorry for her actions? Surely she could never apologize for what she had done out of what she believed to be necessity. It was by necessity that the spell had arisen to start in the dark nights in her homeland. The first instant she had killed a small blue bird because fear had driven her to protect herself. When she coddled its poor body the feathers almost grey in color from a once bright blue she had cried over it. The sort of choking sobs that enveloped the whole body within them each tear falling across her hands and to the ground. She\u2019d buried it and to this day remembered its location a small marker laying above its body. When she had time she would visit it and still apologize for her mistake that cost the bird its life. Moving on to practice  on plant life had been difficult. Surely it was just as sinful and the way Vith looked around him she felt the hatred towards her actions. Or rather assumed it was there if he did not feel it. The forest was as old as time and for her to destroy it was unforgiveable but then again so was letting him die due to his arrogance. Her belief had been in the fact his life was in danger among those people and she though she wished she had another plan she could not bring herself to regret what she had done. He was here now, alive, and she had not rescued him simply so he might help her find the jewel. That realization came to her now even as he scolded her and she hardened her heart to the possibilities within it. What poor judgment she had. He asked her questions that she had plenty of answers to now but each might be just an excuse in his eyes and to tell him truthfully that it had been for him would hurt more than anything. So therefore she searched for a half truth. She found it in a saying that she had learned to repeat more than once and because her kind were the only ones who could produce such magic it was not a lie but not an answer and she could certainly say it. So she did looking him in the eye with her own sharp ones a challenge lingering behind them, \u201cBecause I am drow.\u201dTheir belongings were not in the actual clearing and she stalked off towards the forest refusing to ride behind him again she walked the last eight of a mile to reach them, not a far distance but one that would have been outside of the camp itself. Uma greeted her not unkindly the horse nickering and approaching her even as she tossed his belongings off and in his general direction. Patting the horse on the neck she took her place in the saddle no kind words of affection shared only a silent bond as she turned the beast around and went back towards the main roads where their path lay.

He pulled it from the sheath wanting to make sure they hadn't dented its fine blade. Sure it was more than difficult to dent an elven blade anyway, but who knew what such simple folk could have used this for?Content that the blade was good if not for a little bit of human smudge and smell, he strapped it back around his hip when he suddenly felt his pocket. The ring. After all it hadn't been necessary to use it - which was good. He wasn't feeling safe using something like that and perhaps its usage would endanger others around him too. That was going to stay there for a while, hopefully the entire journey, and as Vith dusted his shoes clean from ash and set his hair and clothes straight again he mounted Wind Strider awaiting Myra who was still the only one to know the road. \"You could mark it on a map you know. Just so we both know where to go.\" Vith would suggest, though it was more of a sign of frustration that he was left having to be guided by Myra - the same frustration that had him scouting around at first and getting caught. Besides what remarks they may have shared in the start and the occasional practical communication their trip was largely silent until Vith found what looked like a suitable place for camp and rest. Vithkun felt tired from the whole ordeal and though it would have been possible to some extend to take a blunder on Wind Strider making it follow Myra's lead, he hadn't been prepared to do so knowing full well now that the forest could contain all sorts of scum. \"This looks like a reasonable place to rest - let's make a camp here.\" Vithkun said and immediately dismounted Wind Strider while unloading his things as if it had already been decided. They had reached a small picturesque clearing where flowers grew in many startling colors and the few oak trees that were surrounding the clearing gave off a light shade as their leaves rustled with a friendly sound.

He looked at the small package of cloth that were to become his tent but decided against even unfolding it. This little place was an oasis and for him to crawl into the tent only made sense as an actual haven from the harsh climate or the bleakness of the human world. This was close to as beautiful as the human world got without the aid of elven magic. Instead of making the cloth into a tent he simply wrapped it around himself a couple of times and lay now in the grass with the flowers around him looking up into the sky reminiscing about his homeland noticing little around him. Slowly he passed into a wave of dreams - the jewel, impossible to reach given the best of his efforts. His older brother besides his 'to be fianc\u00e9' at the alter. His father sitting on the throne more comfortably than ever. They were different in nature but none the less tied together but then... darkness seemed to seep into the dream, a slithering and almost suffocating oblivion encompassed all these images - his father, the jewel, his fianc\u00e9 and brother all wrapped in the same light abolishing darkness as he had felt from Myra's spell and Vith woke up instantly, breathing quickly.The darkness was still encompassing him... no, rather it was night. He wiped drops of sweat off his forehead and sat up relieved. There they were, that stars. Myra. their stuff. Nothing had happened but Vith didn't know what to make of that dream. Elven dreams were often premonitions of what to come - or what the elf carried in his heart. This would be fear, that much he was able to glean. He looked at Myra who was seemingly sound asleep still and quietly got up. It wasn't terribly cold and he made his way down to a decent sized pond nearby. The place was silent and felt almost secluded and untouched as Vith gazed over the water that became almost as silvery as his hair when the moonlight struck it. Back at the clearing there was a muted rustle in the bushes beneath the large oak trees and they swayed slightly in the wind though no wind seemingly touched the crown. Out from the bushes came a rabbit - but this rabbit was four times the size of a normal rabbit - and it approached Myra carefully and silently. If it managed to approach close enough without being spotted, it would would locate her mace - either by pulling the blanket aside and gnawing the leather strip over in one quick bit or by simply grasping it with its teeth if it lay beside her.

Turned away from him she\u2019d left her hood down and hair kept tightly in a severe mishmash on the back of her neck having simple tied it up best she could knowing it might be tangled in the morning. Hearing his rustling behind her she heard not of the tent but of a simple cloth. A few moments to make sure he wouldn\u2019t notice passed and she looked over to see him wrapped within what was his tent but laying on the open ground. Wanting so badly to speak to the small kindness of him remaining out here beside her she clamped shut a moment later when she thought of earlier that day. Shifting back into a position where she could not see him she could still hear him. He rustled often his sleep restless like hers the night before. When he bolted upward she felt his unease even in a half sleep state for she was hibernating more than sleeping because to fully allow herself to fall into that world of dreams would mean to subject herself to horrors. Nightmares came too easily after using spells she ought not to use. Vith rose to head to the pond and she stirred at his movements but did not give him reason to pause. He needed time to process his thoughts and like she the other night she doubted he might share what laid in his dreams. Sometimes they were a very private thing while other times they were humorous enough to share. It appeared that neither would be sharing much of either for a short time and yet they had made such progress before. A poor statement by her to simply state she was Drow earlier when now she wished to reach for him, to explain why she had done the thing she had done. She cast this from her mind quickly. She only wanted to explain because he was the first person who had ever showed her some kindness in a time. That had spoken to her as a person and not as if she were a creature from a different land. That night around the fire when they spoke of stars and the happiness on his face when he saw her were but lapses in judgment on his part. He did not enjoy her company, did not want it, he only needed her as she needed him and yet she wanted so badly for him to speak to her again and she could not reason why. When the rabbit made its way towards her blankets seeking refuge perhaps underneath them she immediately woke. He would not make it to the Morningstar that he might have attempted to draw off by his teeth but instead found her hand gripping it as it raised. Only a few inches as she judged the threat sitting upright next to the creature. \u201cHello,\u201d she addressed it keeping the Morningstar elevated. Things were not always what they seemed in this world and with the oversized creature coming so close he appeared not to fear travelers.

As Vithkun waited and looked into the water he noticed an ever increasing amount of fishes that emerged and each seemed to swim in its own elaborate pattern. There was definitely something odd to these fish and as he stuck his hand into the pond to catch one, it was as if it went right through unable to grasp it and the fish continuing its pattern. Those patterns were not random at all, they were definitely painting some kind of words and a slight shimmering trail left by their tails outlined the contours of the letters. However these letters weren't something he knew about though they bore some resemblance to his own language. Vith looked over his shoulder wondering if he should fetch Myra and ask if she knew, but then again the fish might be gone by the time she arrives and it would only add to the tension that he would wake her up in the middle of the night for nothing. Perhaps he could do something to get to the bottom of this mystery himself.The hill stretched upwards steeply before Myra and if she decided to scale it would be in a pace a lot slower than before despite a narrow path having been paved and obstacles removed.

Forwards until close to the very top she would hear the distant yet audible sound of water running though not the kind that ran from a stream or river but the kind that fell from a cliff. Passing a few trees Myra would also suddenly find the path ending abruptly as a small cottage stood at the end of the road its door not closed completely. A little smoke came from the chimney and the lanterns were lit inside and the window boxes had colorful flowers in them while the grass seemed tended to. There was nothing unwelcoming about the small, yellow painted house though there were no immediate trace of the rabbits. However one with a keen scent could gauge that they had at least been here.

The garden was tended and the grass kept low to allow easy passage from the door. The rabbits were nowhere in sight and yet she felt as if they were near and as if they had led her here. Was it to her doom they had attempted to bring her this way or was it for curiosities sake only? The trees had spoken of one in the forest but this seemed not auspicious at best but then again what was she to do? Return and tell Vith about the rabbit crusaders. Not likely. Steeling herself she approached the small cottage taking every precaution to search for traps in her wake and extend her mind for magic. A dangerous thing to do so openly but without much else to aid her other than a physical weapon it felt appropriate.

It was a reference to a popular elven poem about the thistle and the lily which came from such different places and still the thistle managed to eclipse the lily that had had such a huge head start and benefits from where it was planted. \"The poem is really unlike my kin - at least I cannot imagine anyone today writing such a poem. Perhaps this poem has drow descent like my tea?\" he asked and smiled in response to her mirthful laugh. \"An odd pair we are indeed.\" he said and stared right ahead. \"Of course you will, I'm your prince and you obey your prince as a true underling is supposed to.\" Vithkun said buying into her joke chuckling slightly, curious to hear how such a curse had come about. Vithkun didn't know what to expect, but the joyful and upbeat banter certainly didn't carry through the story she told him. A story of which she had been punished for something she shouldn't have been punished for. Perhaps Myra should just be pleased she was still alive and free, but Vith didn't see it that way. \"The councilor should have been executed.\" he said bluntly as his fists clenched together. \"What immense cowardice - not only to assault you but to lie about the matter as if he was in the right.\" Vith said and narrowed his eyes, his facial features turning hard. It was no way to treat ones people and he was even quite sure she had omitted the worst parts of the story. \"Are you really going to take the jewel back to that bunch? If the tales are true it would grant you power that far surpasses any of the so called elders of the drow society and you could probably make yourself queen of the lands.\" he proposed. \"I would even go as far as to stop you if persisted in telling me that you wanted to deliver it back - because it's my duty to make sure such people do not gain a power that could threaten High Haven but... also because I cannot bear the thought that you would give your oppressors such a gift when you could be benefiting from it yourself.\" Vith said, his gaze fixed firmly ahead.

His irritation on her behalf was a kindness she did not often see but he would never go so far as to seek revenge on her behalf. Of that she was certain.

The jewel would leave in one of their hands and though he sought it for his betrothed in order to decorate her pretty head, at least she assumed it was unreasonably pretty, she sought it for men of power who had the ability to pardon here, to make her a member of a society that she\u2019d only dreamed of as a girl. Vithkun made her rethink everything she\u2019d ever wanted. His defense was no defense at all but a falsehood in word and deed as he attempted to drive those around him. Not sit in the seat himself but reach over and steer from the passenger side taking them off their true course and showing them a lie instead of going down the line to sorting out who he was. She had no blinders attached to her nor any misconceptions about who or what he was and therefore she was able to rip the wheel back. She\u2019d kept control and smacked away his hand after he attempted it again. No matter what he presented to the world she insisted on seeing the truth for after all that was all she could tell him and right now there was no possible way for her to tell him she would not also smack the jewel from his hands and his control. Torn in half the edges were jagged and impossible to realign to set her on the correct path. Her word had been given and at the time it had been true but would her body hold her to that word? Making a decision would certainly test the resolve she carried therefore she decided to put it on the back burner. It would simmer and eventually flow over once it boiled the bubbles on the surface slipping and sending up steam once they hit the fire itself. The warning signs would encompass her whole being but for now she clamped a lid over it telling it that there was no time to consider other options. Not yet, anyways. Vith told her of a flower and a weed. Some might consider the thistle to be much more than it was but anything that invasive was a weed. It took over everything in the area choking and killing it but surviving. It seemed an apt reference to one such as herself who embodied survival. Instead of answering his questions or going into detail on the matter at hand she would avoid them and return to the light hearted banter, \u201cYou know that the thistle is a weed,\u201d she even smiled at the thought of it, \u201cFitting in a way but you\u2019re not pretty enough to be a lily.\u201d Adding insult to injury in but a moment it was still all in good humor as he had mentioned her doing as she should as an underling. Both had the tone that meant it was all in good fun. For a time the matter would be dropped and they could return to the journey that laid ahead of them. A little over two weeks remained on their way to the dwarves. Within their territory in only two they would be watched from that point on until they made it to the checkpoint. She was easily recognizable from a distance and because of this they would not be interfered with at that point in time. Her passage had been reassured by her last visit in which she had established that she was worth her weight to the dwarves by speaking frankly with their King. Straight forward was rarely the way one should speak to such a monarch but it had served her well in the matter as he\u2019d called her behavior rash but honest. He\u2019d known from the way her heart beat inside her chest and how it flowed through the floor that every word she spoke was the truth. There had been no reason to fool the man and requesting a private audience they had the same sort of conversation that she and Vith had shared about the reason behind her truthfulness. Until the point they reached them they were lucky enough to have fair travels. The weather held up as well but the cold would set into their bones before they would reach it. Her bedroll being gone she\u2019d eventually given into his quiet sort of insistence which was really rather loud when he\u2019d grasped her by the shoulders and turned her about and marched her in there like he actually was her boss. Arguing with him she\u2019d turned about rather quickly with his hands on her and they\u2019d slipped down to her upper arms. He was not quite enough taller than her that it was not an uncomfortable position as she looked up to him and then meekly agreed. It had only been so she could take a step backward out of his arms and into the warmth of the tent where he couldn\u2019t see how she shivered from the cold and her lip quivered because it had been the first time she\u2019d felt her stomach churning with excitement. When they\u2019d come across a hot spring the water calm and even she\u2019d been grateful for the distraction. During his own distraction she\u2019d attempted to push him in from behind laughing all while he had stepped aside and she fell forward.  Righting herself in the water on her hands and bottom she\u2019d laughed as she\u2019d emerged brushing her hair from her face. It was heard more and more often the longer they traveled as they allowed each other to get to know one another. At the springs he\u2019d reached down to help her up, one hand, and using the leverage of her position she drew him down into the water with her. Her laugher had faded in an instant as he came down almost on top of her. It had been only a week since their conversation on the road about what had occurred. Her laughter had not stopped because of a bad memory but because it did not come to her. Her mind was perfectly clear as she looked at his pale face and the brightest eyes she\u2019d ever seen meeting hers. Digging in with her hand she scooted back until she was fully floating in the water and still fully clothed. His name had yet to reach her lips but in an instant she\u2019d considered it. Lying inside her mind she was perfectly capable of and she\u2019d promised herself she wouldn\u2019t say it, it was too personal, even though hers was often upon his. Drawing back mentally it appeared both of them had quite a ways to go before they could trust someone when trust should not be shared between. The instant he\u2019d sought her before they had faced Annonai had been the moment that both  had changed for the better. A baby step that was turning into real ones towards a larger change for both. Leaving the springs she\u2019d set them back a few steps by distancing herself physically until the stars fell from the skies. It was on the border of the dwarves lands that it occurred. They were passing into the mountains and resting on the side of a path that walked around the peak of a smaller one. A perfect location for them to look up to the stars above them. It began with one. Myra felt it well before it happened and believed that Vith might as well but she\u2019d still got up from the tent they were now sharing. Touching his shoulder to gently wake him she drew him outside. She remained within the doorway whether he did or not so she could look up but still feel the warmth behind her. The cloak she wore was not warm in and by itself because it needed to be light enough for the other seasons. Slightly cold she\u2019d let it go down her spine as she raised her face to the sky everything there reflected upon her as she saw them fall. A trail of blurred lines crossing the skies as stars met their final end. Dying and leaving one last beautiful tale of their life within the wake their monument to the almost everlasting life of their people gone in an instant and yet there were many more to take their place. A symbol of hope and light. Caught up within the view above them she\u2019d taken in a shuddering breath arms crossed around her like she was embracing herself and she\u2019d whisper, \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "He appeared kingly if only for a moment, his shoulders straightening and his gaze hard and cold.

His biggest issue was the fact that doing just that seemed less and less imaginable. As they approached the dwarves Vithkun grew slightly more weary - and worried. He had one of those bad premonitions one might have before entering a place. Annonai was able to fool him completely until he had the dream, where the gods showed him glimpse of the darkness that the drow used for his magic, but approaching the dwarves he felt a certain anguish. However the weather was nice apart from the cold and there was nothing wrong as the eye could spot, but the feeling of being observed, measured and judged was certainly there. What was he riding towards?The last couple of weeks had been in good spirit though and Vithkun remembered back to when she tried to push him into the water and he moved so she got what she deserved - although a helping hand afterwards had been met with a joyful revenge from Myra as she pulled him down with her. In that moment he had fallen on top of her and his eyes had met hers as if two stars had gazed at each other for the first time, and as she had scooted away from the moment he had in the same moment looked away though a soft smile still lingering. Two stars attracted - both with their own agenda and determination but weren't quite ready to blend yet. And the stars were unusually bright that night as they had sought to dry themselves around the fire although no further words were spoken curious glances had occasionally been cast back and forth. 'What was that and why now?' was the question that almost fell upon Vith's lips and yet they were so far from it. It was an isolated moment and as he went to bed later he assured himself that such a thing was probably meant to stay that way. Nature had a way of turning one's hearts inside out. Later as she assured him they were just on the border of the dwarves' territory they made a break. Had the stars been bright the other days, this day the starry night had almost enveloped them. Myra had awoken him gently and although he first believed something to be wrong, the look in her eyes told of excitement. As they sat there and watched the beautiful stars on the brink between cold and warm at the entrance of the tent the sky showed itself from the most unimaginable beautiful side. However what was even more beautiful was the fact that he shared the moment with someone who could appreciate it just as much. But noticing her shuddering breath it was as if he naturally just put his arm around Myra's back. It was nothing much in terms of warming her in itself but as he did she would be able to lean closer to him and share the warmth he had closer to his body. While looking up into the stars there was this certain connection he felt between him, Myra and everything around them and a content smile manifested itself on his lips.

Of course this would not be the outcome, but he still had doubts about where she was taking him and perhaps this was why he really wanted to treasure this moment so much. The next many days may not at all be this pleasant.\"It was...\" Vithkun said and held onto her for just a short while longer. \"It was nice.\" he said and smiled softly as he went back inside the tent intending to crawl under the sheets feeling somehow content. Even if it was normal travel they would need to save strength and when journeying into dwarven territory much more so.

Separating herself as far from him as possible she\u2019d been settling in by the dining area wrapped in a large blanket that he had proffered since she was missing hers. Heading out in the morning she\u2019d kept it out from the tent itself since they were passing into the mountains. It would serve to keep her warmer than her own cloak as she bundled up within it and held the reins just inside of it with one hand while keeping the other closed. The mountain passes had a chill and snow would soon fall over them making passage almost impossible on the journey back through. Myra knew this but their paths would separate on the return journey, he would head south to the elven lands, where it was warm and lush. The drow lands were southeast and skirted the edges of the elven lands with a barren land between them taken by war and its hatred. If she chose to return she\u2019d pass through the ruins that they took there, skirt the mountains, and through the human lands down to her own. The noise of the forest was lost in the mountains. Sparse life and cragged edges they passed a herd of mountain goats. Tended by the dwarves they were the size of bison and often their mounts with long round horns taken for blown horns and weaponry. Often bows were made of the larger ones, soaked and worked and drawn around until they were limber and though the bows were short, as were the dwarves, they fit their needs well. Humans could not draw them normally for the strength required and Myra commented upon this given them credit for the ingenuity of it. No harm came to the creatures for they could be trimmed without pain. Elves sang their bows from the very trees of their home which became the next topic of conversation. The fair folks bows were beautiful and long spanning far over their height and drawn back so easily by their own. The drow preferred a shorter bow, with curved tops where the string rested upon the wood itself and were often carved from the a mixture of wood and a resin like material making a composite that was practically unbreakable.From there they slipped into a deeper conversation, one that she had been avoiding up to this point. \u201cWhen we arrive you shall be treated according to your station. You are a prince and shall be given due regard but this means that that no one will speak to you until you speak to the King. It is customary.\u201dShe warned him that they would speak to her and he should not take this as an insult. Her presence before meant that she knew many of the outlying guards. They had passed two cities already, both underground and on the border areas hidden beneath the very mountains. Not yet approached she had been given preferential treatment now but the first time she had toed the line they\u2019d surrounded her. She decided to skip that small part of informing him of what was going to happen, suspicion would only make things worse. The hierarchy of the dwarves was not unlike what he might expect. Headed up by the King, Reglin, he was the almighty power for the Burrowen dwarves. There was one other branch, a brother of their own but it was Far East and the Aurrowen dwarves were not lesser than their brethren. The two kings were brothers themselves and chosen to rule by the two councils. Both sides of the dwarves held a council, respected dwarves that were raised up to assist those who ruled them, it was an honorable position. Each council was made of half Borrowen and half Aurrowen and when the time came to select a new king it was chosen of one family with two brothers who were suitable to rule. An odd requirement but dwarven families were large and it was not difficult to find quite a few eligible siblings. Occasionally their had been a Queen instead of a King, and Myra told Vith this, one had to prove themselves to be chosen and if a female had proved herself warrior and scholar she could be given a chance. Only once in their history had both of their people been ruled by Queens but it was said to be a time of great peace and prosperity. That the rulers had to be siblings it raised a question also to the age and passing of the crown. Once one passed the other would rule independently until the next full council of both people. At that time when another set could be chosen they would step down. If one ruled in such a way that caused talk of revolution within the people both would be punished as well. It was as system of checks and balances not common for most races. The full council was held every five years at either location taking a full months travel to reach one another. A short time and something even Myra could not explain because it was done underground. A long tunnel once established in the early days of their people and a closely guarded secret that no outsider would ever be given the privilege of knowing. Moving from the King to the council she told him that there were twelve, an even number. Made of both sides their service was of a time of thirty years. This limit was made so that those serving would not spend so much time from their own home. At the full council those who served on the opposite sides would switch. Therefore each council man served fifteen years in each location. It brought them close to one another as families went along and traditions were kept strong between the two races with an attempt to keep them all close. The council would not be present in full when Vith met with Reglin, only the senior advisor from both Aurrowen and Burrowen that currently served at Burrowen.Myra advised Vith to be tight lipped at the meeting, her presence would explain why he was there and while it was not easy to insult the dwarves she had the distinct feeling he could manage it if he was putting up a front. In the same breath she would add that if he spoke to them not as a Monarch but as a representative of his true people he would find the warmth they had to offer. How he was with her was her hope for his behavior but it was not promised. She did not linger long on the subject to keep him from biting back at her words with the progress they had made. Him dropping some of the barriers around his true self and her calming her anger and laughing and smiling more than she had in years. Turning to the rest of the dwarves they were stereotypical in part, loud, drinkers, and fierce fighters and friends. Their lifespans lingered in the hundreds of years making them akin to half-elves in their time upon the world. It also meant that an elf with an affinity for a dwarf would not lose their friendship so quickly. Manners among elves were important as their memories were as long as their lives but the dwarves had a tendency to speak rashly at times. Boasting and throwing their voices upward in jest meant to bring about the sort of barroom brawl in which all were drunk and laughing and spread across the room at the end with a few bruises. Expressing this to Vith the council and the King himself would be courteous but he could not expect the same of the rest. They spoke their minds for the most part which let you know where you stood. Myra could appreciate such blatant honesty for the sake of honesty and therefore liked them even if they were like drunk children at times. Her excitement ran through her like a tremor as she spoke her love for the people obvious. She\u2019d suggested some time ago that he come up with a gift for the dwarves that they might appreciate. They appreciated the voices of elves and drow alike for their fair tones were far from their own deep steady thrum. She\u2019d be taking her own suggestion after their arrival but it would not be for some time that he might hear her own gentle voice that was like a fine warbler. The mountain pass came to a crevice. High walls on the outside and a slimming path meant that it was a funnel. It was a half mile at the start and shortened to but fifty yards after a few miles a steady inward crawl of the walls that was purposeful but seemed natural. A trained eye would notice where it had been whittled down in sections and no doubt it would not be lost on Vith that this was the way to lay a mighty trap. Also it was the way to lay their doom if this was the only way in and out of the city of Ilief. Obviously Myra had passed it and therefore there was another but what relief would it bring them? The city itself as well was several days in passing, most of it not abandoned but not lived in. The long halls supported by large beams of stone marbled and cut in a pristine manner to be smooth where they would pass for miles. They would see it soon enough but their arrival at the gates, which were not visible, would be at nightfall. They could not enter at night, the way was blocked, and therefore they would spend one night lingering on the edge of a great city and of a pathway back. Neither would retreat if only for different reasons. When morning came they would find a single dwarf waiting for them next to a long wall of stone. The ending they had been awaiting since the beginning of the funnel. It was over a quarter of a mile high and the pinnacle of their talent as the whole of it was smooth and seamless. The dwarf that greeted them was but 4\u20193. Stout in nature he had broad shoulders and an even broader beard of chestnut. His teeth were barely visible when he smiled, which he did when Myra approached making a motion for Vith to remain behind for only a moment. \u201cDavil!\u201dHis name was warm on her lips and she clasped his forearm and he hers, \u201cIt\u2019s quite an honor to be greeted by you,\u201d she told the dwarf her own smile bright and visible as she had no giant beard. Davil grasped her arm in return greeting her just as warmly a few words spoken in dwarvish, a greeting that roughly translated into \u2018I greet you for myself and my forefathers.\u2019 The name of a family was important among their people but honor could be won by even those without. An odd sort of predicament where you were expected to honor those who came before you and given respect for what they had done until you proved yourself otherwise. A line should be strong and it was expected to remain that way. Myra spoke dwarvish well but did not dig into the guttural language keeping to common for the sake of Vith. A short explanation of the reason for their arrival was shared, not that Davil could not guess, he even looked to Vith but as Myra had told him would happen he did not speak. Instead he gestured to them and walked through the wall behind him that appeared to be solid but a moment ago.\u201cIt\u2019s perfectly safe,\u201d Myra reassured Vith before following Davil. On the other side both would emerge into a hall of magnificent proportions. It went miles before them and was open and wide with ceilings as tall as the outer wall itself. An open cart awaited them inside that would take them the half day journey to their heart of the city itself. It was with seating on either side with cushioned back rests along the outside. They would only pass through the Same hall very rarely seeing much else beside the columns. Food had been provided in a small basket, fruits and bread as well as a sweet honey that could be spread over the loaf within it. A jerky was included that Myra handed to Vith but would not tell him what it was. The only animals they had seen before entering was the goats so his guess would be rewarded if he made it. Their arrival at the city would be greeted with a fanfare of sorts. Men, children, and women who stood outside their homes in order to see the fair one that was rumored to be visiting. The entrance from the hall had been cut down to a funnel again and when they emerged it was to a full city. A place of beautiful carved homes with long lines and a staggered creation that was spider web like with a palace at the center with wide precipices which flags were hung along the edges of. Deep purple in color with a black stripe through the center. Aurrowen, Myra would tell Vith, had white in the center instead. Unlike the outside of their world the inner part had soil beneath their feet. There were beautiful trees and flowers decorating homes. The world was alight as if the sun shone but it was explained by giant mirrors above them planted within the walls and placed to reflect the light from the world above them to the land below. It was enough to even make the forestry grow. Approaching the palace Myra was offered a hand in dismounting and Vith was after whether he took it or not. They were escorted into a great hall with several  long tables for feasting. A throne at the far side it was carved of solid amethyst with the base rugged and revealing the stone as it was discovered in the original geodes. The crystal had been grown from a large stone, sung from their voices and given life by their knowledge of how to influence the stone itself. Along the floor between the wide tables was a pathway of obsidian. Never scuffed no matter who passed by it it was shimmering in appearance and sparkling as if it had been pasted with glitter. Walking along it they could see the King immediately. He was taller than most dwarves at 4\u201910 with a glowing mane of black hair brushed until it was smooth and braided downward with stones weaved into the beard itself. On either side stood two dwarves, neither of an appearance that was as magnificent but well kept and groomed. All were dressed in a mixture of leather and cloth in in deep browns and black. Davil who had been with them up to this point would walk before the two here, bowing to his king, before stepping aside. Vith had been informed that he did not need to bow but it would be a sign of respect. Myra bowed to the King dipping low like a man her right leg crossed over her left as she did so. Rising she waited to be addressed. \u201cYour return has been expected,\u201d the King\u2019s voice was booming, echoed by the hall and magnified. Either by the acoustics themselves or some power laid into the very voice itself, \u201cAs has the arrival of one who would accompany you as you had asked permission when you passed back through our halls.\u201d He had been lounging back in the chair. Comfortable with one leg crossed and hands spread over the arm rest. He removed them now and rose to his feet. The platform which the throne rested upon was a few steps up and therefore he was above Vith when sitting and even more so while standing. A king and a prince his ranking still was above. He took the first step down to be slightly more even but they had paused five feet from the steps themselves. Reglin moved his look from Myra to Vithkun his stone features remaining so, \u201cI am honored to welcome a son of the Kingdom of the Fair Ones. You are welcome in my Hall and at my table.\u201d Being invited to the King\u2019s table was quite an honor and would be one shared that night for dinner when it was laid before his throne and Vith would be placed at his side. Myra thought this might occur and informed Vith of the likelihood of it. She would be placed among the common people no matter his respect for her as it simply was not done. As for now she remained silent until asked a direct question. Davil had appeared alone so she could greet him so warmly but she was careful now, and with baited breath she awaited Vith\u2019s response hoping he would be as well.

At High Haven you would feel the comfort of the land already when you set foot there and the elves' presence seemed close to you no matter if they were or not. But the dwarves had huge empty halls and funnels and they'd travel for miles and miles without meeting a single dwarf. Vithkun did however not doubt the fact that they were watched and assessed although he couldn't quite figure out from where. There weren't like elves who did so with magic and naturally blending into the woods. No it was as if the stone and marble itself observed the both of them.\u00a0The arduous journey did feel somewhat shorter as Myra told him - quite frankly - everything there was worth knowing about the dwarves as they made their way. She had really absorbed a lot of information and sometimes Vithkun couldn't help but let his jaw drop from the amazing sights and the stories Myra coupled to them. Still he quickly composed himself as to not look too stupid. However important the customs were at the halls of the dwarves Vithkun wasn't very happy about being told how to act and being 'tight lipped' was not a virtue from where he hailed and sharp words were usually exchanged between those who didn't fully trust each other.\u00a0Another night passed and even though Myra told Vith so it was hard to comprehend that they were at the edge of a sprawling Dwarven city, but perhaps the next day would reveal more. As Vithkun woke up he spotted a small dwarf ready to greet them. Well small was the wrong word 'compact and sturdy' was a far better fit to their body shape. 'Barrel shaped' came to mind too but didn't cross his lips.\u00a0\"Davil?\" Vithkun said as Myra quickly trotted towards the Dwarf and greeted him. 'Does she know all their names to as well as history?' Vithkun thought as a smile curled up his lips. \"Perfectly safe?\" Vithkun commented and chuckled. \"Well it seems dangerous to me, but 'perfectly safe' have brought a lot of problems for me before - so why not give it a go?\" he said sarcastically following Myra through the crevice.\u00a0However what awaited on the other side certainly carried a risk - for losing his jaw permanently. This huge city outlined as a web and with countless mirrors in the cave ceiling to direct sunlight into the city was breathtaking. He then stepped up into the open cart and felt for the first time in a long while welcome somewhere and a soft smile emerged as he took a bite of an orange laying there before Myra handed him a piece of jerky.\u00a0\"I've been in Isra long enough to know what this is.\" he said with a wry smile, and though he wasn't very fond of goat jerky he ate it anyway sensing the good quality. The would ride along for almost half a day and seeing the curious citizen rush up to see them was another and more positive experience than when he was a zoo animal a couple of days ago.\u00a0Finally they approached the palace where they were to meet the king of this city and Vithkun took a deep breath before accepting the hand. 'So far so good' he thought as he walked through the marbled hall with the obsidian floor and many feasting tables. They did love food it seemed. The king's voice boomed through the halls and Vithkun almost took it as a challenge, though he realized that if a king had to address the amount of people that could fit in here such a voice would be needed.\u00a0\"I am deeply grateful that you present us with food, lodging and safe passing through your halls.\" Vithkun said and bowed placing his right arm in front of him and his left of the back. Vithkun was slightly surprised however that Myra had seemed to already have planned this when she had traveled back after unsuccessfully trying to obtain the jewel at first. She was a crafty elf for sure and planned ahead further than Vithkun perhaps liked to think about.\u00a0\"The offer to sit at your side is one I would gladly accept so we can share our people's thoughts, culture and visions.\" Vithkun said and stood up again casting a quick glance at Myra. \"However the customs of the dwarves is quite new to me and I may have many questions I want to present to you - but as my kin does we speak of these matters using select and carefully thought out words so that we may ease the understanding between differing cultures. Therefore I ask of you if I may invite Myralthrine of Host to sit next to me at your table? It would greatly comfort me to have her by my side as mediator.\" Vithkun spoke, his feelings true to his word. Sitting a single elf among dwarves a whole night sounded dauntingly and even more so than he was readily able to admit.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The journey - slowly travelling towards the dwarven city - was impressive and eerie at the same time.

To be allowed to explore the outer areas was off limits even to the Prince standing beside her. Myra was still partly bowed when the King rose and while Vithkun asked for her guiding hand at his table she worried this would not be taken well. It was one thing to accept the invitation himself but to invite another along on his behalf could be seen as coarse. Otherwise he had been quite polite to a point in which she was grateful. Rising fully now as her name had been brought up she almost spoke but a look from Davil silenced her. The King seemed to be considering his suggestion his stony face a wall not unlike the one surrounding their home. Finally he smiled in agreement, \u201cI have not seen the Lady since her last passing and it has been some  time, I would be happy to entertain her on your request so I might inquire as to her health as well.\u201d Myra smiled in return to the King at this before he continued on, \u201cThough for now I believe your journey here has been long and ardous, I would offer you quarters and a time to rest before the festivities tonight.\u201d A King could not be refused and an offer as a thinly veiled order in part even to his visiting dignitary.

His own room was within the palace, one of the few towers and furnished with heavy furniture made of wood and stone together. The ceiling was the true marvel as it resembled the night sky diamonds inserted into the darkness of its depths and sparkling as if there was some light source behind it giving the room a dim glow without any torch light. A bath had been drawn and an offer to clean his clothes made if he accepted it. They would be laid out by the time he returned pristine and scrubbed. Beside it would be a mahogany box, the edges were rounded with no clear line of entry to it but once he pulled at the top it would give way. Inside was a circlet, platinum in appearance with thick surrounding lines and the inner sections being scooped out in no apparent pattern with wide oval shapes stretched and formed. Rubies had been inserted along the inner edges, they were clear of imperfection and the piece while not as graceful as the elves was a true masterpiece.

Perhaps he started to see why Myra had grown fond of these people, though it would likely take longer for him to fully immerse himself in the ways of the dwarves - and likely it would never truly happen but respect could be there none the less. \"I will be looking forward to the banquet tonight then.\" Vithkun said and bowed again, this time a little less but still enough to show his thanks looking at Myra with an inquiring gaze when he was led in another direction than her. Well this was to be expected he thought. The king would seek to try and treat him as well as possible due to his station although he could imagine that Myra due to what she seemed to have done for dwarves would command a similar if not better treatment. Apparently this was not the case but it was something to bring up in private conversation a little later. Vithkun stepped into his chambers and immediately noticed that the fancy stone work certainly wasn't limited to the throne hall. No the strange obsidian rock was adorning the seiling giving off a strange dim light that - even though nothing could truly resemble the night sky apart from the eyes that reflected it - was visually quite close to it. Of course having his clothes cleaned would be great as they had quite a few miles in them since he last cleaned them - and he wasn't very good at that kind of manual labor. A bath had been prepared for him too and letting his towel drop he stepped into bathtub that were also carved from the same black sparkly rock as the ceiling. The water was definitely on the warm side and he clenched his teeth before sliding into the water completely immersing himself in it but for his head that rested on the edge of the tub and shiny white hair that hung like a silken curtain from the same edge - still dry as the blue eyes turned to the ceiling where the dwarven stars shone dimly. The starry nights were good for guidance every time he looked at them, and though these stars were aligned differently than those in the sky Vithkun did admire these 'Stars of the earth' and thought they may even serve to guiding posts for the dwarves. Having finished his bath and dressing himself in the bathrobe the dwarves had also provided he eyes a small wooden box that was clearly inviting Vithkun to open it. Carefully touching it the hidden lid opened almost effortlessly and a circlet of marvelous creation unveiled itself. He gently held it up between his fingers and studied it seeing the rubies that were nicely aligned and how the edges were so skillfully rounded that he couldn't help but flash a smile. It wasn't as light as had it been elvish and also lacked the otherworldly hue that the best elven jewelry could posses, however he understood as much as this certainly being a gift of no small proportion. He was sure to wear it tonight but unsure of how to repay it. ", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Vithkun smiled kindly and nodded his head slightly.

Being reassured by the same straightforward manner that had reassured him she felt comfortable with the dwarves. They treated her like a person instead of a parasite and humoring her request for safe passage was a kindness she could have never expected from her kin or Vith\u2019s brethren. Davil was the one that showed her to her quarters, part of the servants section. She was not visiting royalty or important in the eyes of the King other than a curiosity that he exploited for information on the outside world. He treated her kindly because it was his way for the moment and she was known as dwarf friend for the gifts she had returned with on her passage the second time. They were ancient works that had been done by dwarves and humans long forgotten. Her gift the first time had been but a simple kindness of honesty. This time as she had informed Vith would be a pleasant gift she intended to raise her voice in song, something she had not done before or in some time except to the forest in passing. A fresh bath had been drawn for her. There was a miraculous system of springs around the mountains themselves, fresh water pooling up from the world below them. They had been funneled, downhill mostly, in order to provide clean water, privies that would wash away almost immediately when one pulled a chain to release the flow, and a bathing system where it was commonplace for the King to take one daily and most of the people weekly if not sooner if their work or station was one of physical labor. For the feast tonight everyone would be freshly bathed and be attending in their best. Myra had nothing but the clothes she wore on her back and but few changes. All worn from the road and given but the little attention she could to patching them when necessary. Coming out from her bath she found a gift not unlike Vith had done. Hers was a simple gown of a crushed velvet in the deepest blue. It played against her skin as if the colors were meant to flow together silver accents around the waist and arms that drew attention to a shapely form she generally kept hidden with bracers and gear. Her long hair was attended to by a dwarf girl who had explained that the dress once belonged to an elf that remained with them. She had since passed and left many of her belongings. It was by the grace of the King that he remembered of her things and offered this one to Myra so she might look suitable at his table instead of among the people. The girl wold brush out her hair and pull it back as she told her this tale brushing it and braiding it back only around the center with silver wire allowing most to hang loosely down her back revealing that it went to her bottom and flowed with a gentle wave and thickness shimmering with the attention it was given. Myra had thanked her before going to the hall itself. It was a marvel during the day but the roaring fires, grumbling voices, and the banners now laid across the tables for the feast spoke of wonder. Iron plates had been arranged, large casks of mead brought, and even a bottle of wine had been pulled from storage, elven in make and aged beautifully, for the prince.

Once she was clear of the chairs she had a path to the middle of the steps that was unencumbered. To sing only for the King would have been a fine gift in and by itself but to sing for the court and the people was to want to not only impress but to give to them all and it was a mighty thing to have such a skill to be able to do so. She knew the dwarves would find it so and therefore it had been decided. As she moved to the center turning to face the King there began to be quiet within the hall. Voices that were murmuring became soft and then non-existent. The only sound that existed was the gentle placing down of cups as most silver was upon the plates finished with. The main table had been cleared while she made her way around as well but it had not been enough to hide her form as she moved long legs and an ease to the way her hips turned took away the severe stomping of her battle stance and replaced it with a saunter. Standing still now she bowed the King, rose and spoke to all in the room while still facing him, \"I have a gift for your highness, I have no wealth to offer, nor any goods that might be worthy of you, therefore I would like to sing for you.\" Reglin nodded, a stern expression only for looks as his approval was given. Clasping her hands before her she would not sing in dwarvish, or elvish, but in the language of the Drows. In Aleath. A somber sort of language that had deep vowels and a lilting tone that while was beautiful was haunting when sung because it required a slightly lower register to perform correctly. It has also not been spoken outside of Drow lands in some time as it was rare to see one of her people beyond the borders. When she sang the King could feel the sadness of the tale, feel the ebb and flow of a once happy time and the change into madness and then sorrow at a loss. It could be mistaken for that of a lovers fate like Loriedaine but it was not. If Vithkun understood Drow he would know she spoke of their people, of a love shared between them. Of the sharing of their fate and the once sharing of their lands as they coexisted in friendship and prosperity. Then the change, in the hearts of the people, a jewel that was stolen from its place and taken beyond the borders and reach of both races. The sorrow of the song might have been for the loss of the jewel itself but she did not feel it so, she sang of the loss between those who were brothers in spirit. Her voice rose and fell flowing through the notes like a gentle brook a slightly rasp to the edge of it as if it had hit the current too hard and was taken by the undertow if but for a moment. She had a soft gentle way of reaching down to the lowest part of her registers and a strong high that was as pure as the morning dew. It would make a regular man weep to hear the sadness laid within it and a few of the dwarves were rubbing at their eyes as if there was something within it. Reglin watched with rapt attention his lips parting not in a frown but in an expression of uncertainty. He had expected a happy tune from the young woman but the woe he felt there reached farther than he cared for it too. Despite his uncertainty of that he had no right to deny it had been beautiful and the silence that encompassed the room after astounding. No one had reached for a glass, no one coughed or fidgeted. Everyone stared at the woman as if she had drawn all of the world to her if only for a moment.

The young woman had certainly sneaked into many places she should not have been when within the city walls as well as did her own research outside of them.

This one song in the classic elven language which I'm sure will sound spectacular beneath these domes.\" he said and gesticulated upwards towards the distinct architecture the dwarves used in their hall that Myra had told him would enhance their song.

As the prince struck the first the notes seem to create a certain radiance that would convey a place and feeling and as soon as he started singing in the beautiful elven language of his kin and the song would clearly be of the splendor and grandeur of his home and people.

Vithkun's song would however not only tell them stories of his words but directly to their heart and many would start seeing the trees, plains and sky before them quite vividly as Vithkun proceeded to sing. This song was not a regular song, but what they called Valliste, which was the magic songs, where the elf that sang would use certain magic tricks to convey lifelike pictures through the song and words - and although these pictures only lives in people's heads, they would be beautiful and long lived in memory. It was about the finest gift an elf could give without parting himself of anything and a skill that had famed a few elven bards through generations - and Vithkun was particularly adept at it. After the start the song flew on like a young bird and touched many places in the elven history and showed many pictures to the listeners before the song was quietly rounded off at the end as if to give the audience a safe landing and return to the pictures that were before their eyes. Vithkun smiled feeling satisfied with the performance although it had been a while and he hoped that such an adventurous song was something that dwarves liked.

How about you let me play against you for a couple of rounds? I want to learn this game!\" he said with a wry smile and moved closer to the game board drawing Myra with him unconsciously. \"I don't expect an expert like you to fear defeat in the hands of a novice elf, so what is the danger?\" he asked and shrugged hoping they would let him play along a bit.

As soon as he had thrown it he knew it was bound to not quite be as good as the previous one - and rightly so it landed a bit further from the middle than it had done before.
