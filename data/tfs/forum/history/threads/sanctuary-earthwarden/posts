It was greatly amusing, but Jun felt the need to do something else.Jun carefully knelt down into the long grass, surrounded by the flowers Va'nei had created with her breath. She closed her eyes, placed her hands together and prayed and gave thanks. She thought about how grateful she was to be beholden to such a rarely found, magical place. She thought about all the adventures she had been and the mighty beings she had encountered. A wealth of emotions, sad, terrified, joyful, pleasurable, peaceful, lustful, sorrowful, all things she had felt in the past were washing over her. Memories ranging from the destruction of Merimill to Lady Camilla's first wedding, to her underwater adventure with Calico and her travels with Doobie, they all floated to the surface of her mind as if they were being pulled there.And she thought of her grandmother, whom she so greatly revered, experiencing all the same things on her journey.It wasn't long before Va'nei's flowers started to have some company. Slowly but surely more flowers began to appear. These strange bulbs erupted into brilliant blooms of various colors and shapes, and a fruiting body appeared within their cores.So many emotions, so many memories, so many colors. Each of the fruiting bodies responded by departing from their blooms and floating into the air around her. Like glowing marbles, they danced and spun and twirled in perfect harmony. There was an eerie, powerful presence floating around the young mage, something not quite alive but most certainly not dead, a primal existence which had no need of sapience to justify itself. Though it was dwarfed by the mighty power of the Earthwarden, it asserted itself around Jun.There were two orbs which did not act like the others. One was a silvery grey, and the other a deep, violet purple. Instead of dancing, they flanked Jun's body, one on the left and the other on the right. They settled there as Jun continued to kneel in prayer.Most baffling of all, Jun wasn't even aware that all this was happening, not until she suddenly opened her eyes and saw the spectacle around her.\"What the-\" In that moment the presence faded, and the orbs popped, but it was a soundless pop, a burst of light followed by trailing wisps of luminous dust which floated about in the wind until they were disbursed.The flowers withered.Startled, Jun stood up and swiveled towards the Earthwarden with a perplexed gaze.
