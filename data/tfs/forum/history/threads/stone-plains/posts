However, the smaller brute had much more wits than Theev'Nok would've thought. As his fist came downwards, his forearm was smashed away by that of Thrashnald's, who continued to spin around after the punch to send his elbow into the jaw of the orc. Spinning around once more, he leapt into he air and kicked Theev'Nok again in the same spot, making him much angrier now.Charging forward Theev'Nok lifted up Thrashnald, but eventually broke down after the repetitive smashes Thrashnald's elbow delivered to the spine of such a beast. He ended up hissing and roaring mightily in pain as he grew limp in his arms, letting go as Thrashnald squirmed out, diving to face him once more. Theev'Nok sent a fist out towards the Necromancer, but he caught it with blinding light, catching the orc by the forearm under his armpit and repeatedly smashed the brute's face. This wasn't very effective for the first few hits, however, as time went on, he began to grow dizzy.The twelth hit made Theev'Nok aware he needed to do more. He sent his own fist into the square chest of Thrashnald, making him let go of his advantage, but continued to march forward. Roaring mightily, Theev'Nok charged forward once more, only to be lifted up by Thrashnald suddenly. Somehow, the Necromancer ducked under his massive blow, lifting him up by the hips, turning the corner, and smashing him down, his neck bending violently to the left, a few mightily violent snaps heard and the beast roared out mightily in a masculine, yet painful, cry.From here, he was lifted up loosely by Thrashnald, a strong grip with his right hand upon the collar bone of such a beast. His head was limp, but yet he was breathing, staring downwards to look up at Thrashnald, who cocked back a fist to slam into Theev'Nok's face. \"N-No...\" he coughed out, an elbow launched upwards, tossing the fist away. But Thrashnald was much more energized than Theev'Nok, by far. Another fist was raised mightily, after slamming into Theev'Nok's defending arm, making sure it wasn't an issue. \"I....I...\" He looked to Zar'Dura, a heavy, tearing face as he reached towards her, then a fist slammed straight into the neck directly below the jaw of such a beast, the impact so forceful that the grip upon the bone was lost, and the massive brute was slammed upon the ground. Wheezing out a tired, lazy breath, his eyes seemed to pour out the tears that have been held up for so long his entire life, a hand curling to a small fist as he looked to Zar'Dura. Was this truly how it was to end? A fatal blow, delivered by their rival, the darkness of their world? The one who he was meant to destroy, who he was supposed to be the bane of, defeats him? With his own strength, no less? His rage consumed him before, and now, all he could do was cry a silent cry. Staring to Zar'Dura, a thousand prayers were sent towards the Listener. She couldn't die, no. Not at his hands. His cry was nothing more than a couple flexes in his chest, eyes dilating as he continued to lose strength to look to her. The only thing that thrived was his tears, the river as if life itself pouring from the vessel which carried such a loyal and brave warrior for so long. And he was young too, with only a few years as a man... With no heir, with no offspring, with no wife..\u00a0His last breath was heard, and his eyes slowly closed, a sorrowful face plastered upon the orc.Theev'Nok The Brute, was dead...At this point, nearby Zar'Dura Theev'Nok's strange WarHorn was present, an obvious, ivory-white item placed there. The dragon blade was still attacking, until the sudden shout from Thrashnald called it, sprinting back to Thrashnald, who was panting, with an unbelievable amount of loyalty, within an instant of the command he already knew what to do. Leaping into the air it formed into a sword once more, the hilt falling directly into Thrashnald's hand, who was marching forward with a heavy breathing, face murderous, stepping over Theev'Nok's corpse as he marched forward.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The dragon screeched and mattered with hundreds of metal scraping and clicking noises all at once as it began sprinting towards Zar'Dura, catching up in speed and rolling every now and then to shorten even more distance between them two, hoping to slash at her or jump at her with a spinning body to cut and slash her."}, "post-27488": {"user": "Zar'Dura the Listener", "user_num": 1055, "timestamp": "1457311487000", "message": "Any attempt at movement halted when she saw what was happening to Theev'Nok, and it took all of her focus and will just to keep chanting.. but even that ceased to be when she saw Theev go limp in the grasp of the Necromancer. \"NO!\" The heart-rending cry torn from the girl's throat as she saw that Theev'Nok the Brute had met his match, and indeed, his end, seemed fit to make the earth tremble in the force of her sorrow.

Appearing from the Necromancer's own shadow crawled out Zash'Neck The Snake, a dagger yanked out, resulting in wide eyes from Thrashnald who tried to spin around. But all was too soon as the dagger was seen climbing out of the other side of his shoulder, roaring mightily as he slammed his elbow into Zash'Neck's temple, swirling around to strike his sword down upon the archer, taking his head clean off.That is, of course, if Rev'Nahn wasn't there. As if he crawled from shadows as well he was there within an instant, his greatswords blocking the blow with an 'X' formation, sliding his swords together till Thrashnald's arms were raised highly, a mighty gaze of horror upon his face as Rev'Nahn deep-kicked the Necromancer in his stomach, sending him back to skid his feet against the ground, nearly falling as he regained his balance, to look straight up to find him and him alone staring back, his followers simply standing there in curiosity on what would pursue the Chieftan's eyes locking onto Thrashnald's.The Chieftan's grip upon his spear tightened, muscles rippling in his equipped arm as his death stare remained locking onto Thrashnald's worrying eyes. Stammering to respond to the now slowly walking forward Thorok, the Necromancer spoke. \"Your pillar has fallen!!! Your tribe shall fall under itself!! A-And the thousand hells upon that!!!\" He continued to back up, his grip tightening on his own sword as Thorok now jogged forward, teeth bared as he stopped for a stance to throw his spear, roaring mightily as the spear thundered towards Thrashnald with speed from the heavens.It seemed but a flash, tearing through the wrong side of Thrashnald's chest, making Thrashnald continue to stagger back as Thorok saw his job undone, slashing into the ground below him as a portal came up. Tripping into it, Thrashnald still held fear as Thorok was barely far away enough to roar in anger, charge at him, and miss the portal in just that small amount of time.Huffing with a mighty adrenaline flowing through his veins, his way of thinking was suddenly stopped, when his name was called by Rev'Nahn.\"Thorok...\"Turning around, the war face upon the Chieftan faded within an instant. Theev'Nok.... laid there upon the ground, arm reached out towards the rocks nearby him. Thorok's vision blurred, his face worsened as he let out a cough, weakness, for once, showing within even the Chieftan's face. An elbow was brought up, cupping the lower half of his face with a bent wrist as he looked away for a moment, mustering his strength to look back to the brute, whose skin color changed back to that of before.It was the longest ten paces Thorok ever walked, dropping to both of his knees as his right hand lifted up Theev'Nok's broken neck, placing their foreheads together as he heard no breath, nor felt the mighty winds that escaped such a mountain as Theev'Nok. After whimpering for quite some time, mixed with growling, and even tears, Thorok spoke once more. \"M-May the lands you walk quake, and the winds carry every word as we wait for you in Zro'Folum, brother....\"Rev'Nahn and Zash'Neck would both be next to Zar'Dura now, waiting for Thorok to get done. But done was he not with Theev'Nok The Brute, lifting the giant into his arms, holding him as close as he could to his chest as he shoved his own face into Theev'Nok's, crying out a mighty roar, staggering for a moment before standing tall, throwing his head back, and yelling out one last act of rage, echoing in the now silent plains forever it seemed.And so from there, there the march would begin. Rev'Nahn, Zash'Neck, and Zar'Dura, all following behind Thorok, who managed to carry Theev'Nok's massive vessel to their lands, eventually.The walk to Falkreath was forever in the eyes of the Chieftan.

Perhaps even days ago by now.Nereida stepped forward, reaching out with a hand. She wanted to touch the shield he hid behind, curious of it. It was large, and unlike the shields of the city guard.

With every step the woman takes, Tinker squeezes harder. If she gets close enough, a bolt will find its way in the woman's jugular.

She turned to look at Havalon, and as he moved, digging the shield into the ground, sliding his weapon on the earth, she gasped and stepped back.This had never happened before. Signs of aggression. She wasn't watching where she was stepping, and a crack in the stone had her falling, a small cry ripping from her lips as she fell hard. Blood rushed to the surface of her elbow, and a wicked crack resounded from her ankle. Her dark hair flowed all around her, her poor, tattered dress barely anything to guard her skin.Pushing up onto her hands, she didn't realize that she had scraped her elbow so badly, red rivulets of her blood already streaking down the dirty skin of her arm as both hands went to gently cradle her snapped ankle. There was an obvious look of pain and despair in her face, and her quick, sob-like breaths showed her distress. Touching her ankle, she cried out.Ankles she knew nothing about. Fins were an altogether different thing, and feet? Well, Nereida hadn't known that they could be so fragile. All of her hurt where she'd fallen on the hard stone, but there were no tears in her eyes when she looked up at them. Tears were rare for mermaids, as it was. Pain, however, was not.They were still so aggressive, however, that Nereida began to scooch away from them on the stone, wincing as her foot was dragged along with her, putting distance between herself and the twosome.
