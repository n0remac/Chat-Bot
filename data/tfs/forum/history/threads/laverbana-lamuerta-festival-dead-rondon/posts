Well, some are malevolent, seeking to cause harm and mayhem to the living while they can, for once the moon finally completes its cycle, the veil becomesstrong enough to keep the dead at bay once more.In R O N D O N, the celebration is a sight unlike any other, with colors, candles,flowers, and music alight in the air. There are many games, many costumes, andmany unique traditions that promise to be exciting for any who venture there!So come one, come all to celebrate and rejoice in the legacy of our ancestors!____________________________________________________________________________________________There are many games to play in Rondon, more so than the usual card tricks or dicethat the locals like to roll. During this festival, lord and layman are alike, and everyoneis treated equally, for the Dead do not care if you are a fool or a king!T O N T O R E YA classic game, take your chance with the benevolence of the spirits! Head to thegraveyards or the ElEscrisuenos scattered around the village, and shout, \"Tontorey!\"The spirit at the gravestone or the shrine may bless you, or curse you (or ignore you,as sometimes they are want to do). There is no direct translation for tontorey in theCommon language, but it could roughly translate to \"fool or king\".[ Make an IC post visiting a gravestone or one of the small shrines scattered all over Rondon, at most door shops or home steps. Shout the phrase, and then roll a d20. 1-4, the Spirit will think you a King and bless you with a gold Rondi coin. 5 - 15, the spirit ignores you and nothing happens. 16 - 20, the Spirit will think you a fool, and 'trick' you by making you blind OR deaf for only a few minutes (player's choice!)]B O B B I N G for C O R K SRondi wine corks are uniquely shaped, wider than most and rounded at the top.A common game by shop keeps or found within the scattered courtyards of Rondonis to put your hands behind your back and try to catch the corks using only your teeth!Prizes are given depending on how many corks you can catch!1 Cork\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2-3 Corks\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 4-5 Corks\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Catching 1 Cork gets you enchanted Sweet Bread, which grants the abilityto commune and speak with the Dead during LaVerbana.

SomeRondi gypsies are known to enchant their whicks to everlight.The prizes for Apaga LaLlama are the same as Bobbing for Apples, with the inclusionthat if you get all 6 wicks, you get Rondi Wine in the filigree pitcher as your prize![ Roll a d6. The number you get represents the number of wicks your character was able to 'snap'. The number corresponds to the prize! ]____________________________________________________________________________________________L a D A N Z A de L a M U E R T AA parade through the streets of Rondon filled with music and dancing, to celebrate the dead. Usually a young woman is \u201cblessed\u201d with representing LaMuerta, who is usually paired with LoSueno, gods believed to rule over the Realm of the Blessed Dead. Guitar music is usually played, as it is a Rondi belief that the guitar can be heard through the veil that separates the Living from the Dead, no matter what time of year it is. The parade usually ends at the Palace of Thorns, where a great feast is held.[If you post to the palace, there are celebrations everywhere, and a buffet full of traditional Rondi (re: Spanish) food and wine and sweets. Everyone is masked, or facepainted, making it somewhat of a masquerade ball! LaMuerta and LoSueno will be NPC posted, and other than the foyer, ballroom, and adjacent sitting rooms and gardens, the rest of the palace is off limits to wanderers!]E l C O R R E O de L o s P R E L A D O SIn Rondon, the Bull is known as being a Guardian of the Dead. \u201cThe Running of the Guardians\u201d is an age-old tradition of Rondon where the young (or the willing) dress as the malevolent dead and try to out-race the bulls! The winner of the race usually wins a chest of Rondi gold.[3 obstacles, roll a d20 per obstacle. The person(s) with the number 12, or closest to the number 12, get a +2 to their next roll. This number will stack if a person rolls the closest twice in a row.]____________________________________________________________________________________________S K U L L S and H E A D G E A RThe locals of Rondon know that when LaVerbana de La Muerta comes along, the veil between the spirit world and the human world is thin enough to walk through. The spirits of the past come back to their homes, cities and lands and will play tricks (or even harm!) if the spirits are malevolent. In order to protect themselves, and also as a means of showing honor to their beloved ancestors, the living of Rondon paint their faces or wear masks of a skull and wear enchanted flowers or hats so they can see and hear the dead, and also trick the malevolent spirits into thinking they are also among the dead. Characters can purchase masks for 1 Silver Rondi, or get their face painted for 3 Silver Rondi at the courtyards (or at the palace) within Rondon. Facepaint is enchanted to stay on for at least 24 hours, regardless of damage done to the face. Masks and Facepaint allow the wearer to SEE THE DEAD while the mask or face paint is on and intact. L o s E S C R I S U E N O SThere are many small shrines all over the villages and towns, usually to one side of door steps or door ways or in small alcoves built into the walls of homes. Candles, flowers, images of LaMuerta and LoSueno, sweetbreads, pictures, and trinkets that once belonged to the recently passed (within the year) are set there, so the recently-dead spirits of the ones that have only JUST passed might find their way \u201chome\u201d from the cemeteries and receive closure. These small shrines will also have written notes or messages from their living loved ones there, with a pen left for the dead to write a note back if they so desire.____________________________________________________________________________________________Post in this thread to participate inLaVerbana de LaMuerta.It is located in:The City of Rondon. The games are located in the various courtyards located all around the city.LaDanza de LaMuerta is located at the Palace of Thorns, and ElCorreo de LosPrelados is down the main avenue.Daytime:You will not see ghosts or ghoulies in the daytime.Nighttime:Every candle imaginable is alight, and if your face is painted or you have a mask on, you will be able to see the ghosts of ancestors haunting the streets, parties, cemeteries -- and they're probably having their own fun and parties as well. You might even catch a glimpse of LaMuerta or LoSueno (NPC'd by me!), and if you do? You will receive an awesome gift.City Guards:City Guards are extra vigilant during LaVerbana, for they not only have to guard against living threats, but undead threats as well.

It was Aleister's regular habit to see through the veil separating the living from the dead, and even bring things back from the other side. Seeing the actions of the humans as they gained a tiny and temporary glimpse into the other side interested him greatly; as well as the actions of the dead that were able to pass back into this world relatively unmolested.As entertaining as the festival was with its elaborate costumes and bright colors, and as intellectually interesting as the behavior of the party-goers was, it paled in comparison to the feeling of ease and relief the necromancer felt walking with Osseus on his arm down the street. In Helmfirth, Aleister could (and did) have parties, and he could (and did) observe the lower forms of life in their natural state, but this was special. At home his time with Osseus had to be spent behind closed doors to avoid the appearance of impropriety, even though anyone of any importance was undoubtedly aware of their affinity for one-another. Something as simple as walking down the street arm-in-arm unnoticed by anyone around them was a welcome and rare luxury.Even the way Osseus spoke was different than back home. In Helmfirth it would have seemed extremely out of place for Osseus to excitedly beckon the lord over to a table so that they might have their faces painted with enchanted paint. Osseus's blue eyes glowing brighter and happily gesturing brought a smile to Aleister's face.\"Indeed we must!\" Aleister confirmed, matching Osseus's enthusiasm for the novelty.Aleister led Osseus over to what he was certain was one of many face painters scattered about the square, all busying themselves with the work of painting faces. Standing in front of one of the painters, Aleister in a long black coat with his white hair falling out from under a simple black top hat, and Osseus in its cloak, the pair stood and waited to be acknowledged by the painter.Their normal roles of seneschal and high ranking aristocrat seemed to have all but melted away, leaving only the two of them to enjoy their mutual infatuation.

If Jun wasn't careful the number of children clinging to her may soon turn it into a cuddle pile after they drag her down to the dirt. Alden, hands now free, accepts the whip. He'd not let the kids use it since a whip was quite hard to handle, however, he'd used one before and wasn't terrible at it. He'd not been overly fond of the weapon though since it took quite a while to kill someone with it. \"Alright, I'll give it a try.\" Twelve eyes suddenly focus in on him the kids always eager to see their daddy do stuff.

He glanced up at the coming dusk, and indeed, it made the man's eyes seem to... glow. When he smiled, even the white of his teeth had a certain glow about them, and yet still, he went unnoticed by anyone else. \"It seems I will be busy very soon. Enjoy the festivities, Aleksandr,\" he said with a bow of his head.His cigar just disappeared and he swung his guitar so it rested in his hands. He strolled away, a few steps, then paused, and turned back to him. \"I think, however, that this is not the last time we will meet. No, I think you will need some time to get your... shall we say, business? ... in order.\" Another one of those gamine grins and he strummed a cord on his decorated guitar.Immediately, Aleksandr could feel a deep, deep seeded magic begin to hum in Aleksandr's own blood.

Sweet breads sopped up what was spilled or filled bellies that were getting a little too tipsy. Fireworks went off overhead, filling the dark of the sky with light for a moment to gather everyone's attention.Rondi conversation was lively around everyone -- there'd almost be no room to actually walk and move and everyone's gaze was either on the street where LaDanza would begin, or up in the sky where the fringes of the firework had made almost a holograph of what was happening in the main square of the city.A beautiful woman with her face painted as a skull stepped out into the square as a guitar strummed -- heard by all. A handsome young man was at the center, dressed in a suit of black -- lined with scarlet and gold. The woman was veiled and her skirts were volumnious --and everything fell silent as the man tapped against his guitar, a hollow wooden sound beginning before his fingers strummed the guitar and the beautiful woman began to spin, her scarlet skirts swaying around her graceful movements.[ Mooood music!  ]It was a battle of wills then -- between \"LaMuerta\" -- with candles lit in her hair among the red and gold roses -- whose heels snapped on the stone of the floor and the smooth strings and fingertips of \"LoSueno\". There was darkness all around them save for where the candles illuminated them both -- lovers locked in a back and forth, a battle, a conversation of music and dance and grace and symbology of the after life and the waking dream that LoSueno walked.Faster she danced, faster he played, bolder, closer, higher, faster -- displayed for everyone to watch as the stand off became more and more heated -- guitar versus dancer -- death versus dreams -- man vs wife -- an age old song that so many new as guitar and heels clashed and became one---- And with a sudden BURST of light the guitar sped up as sixteen other dancers revealed themselves, swirling into the song, joined by a huge cast of musicians and guitar players.Rondi citizens yelled in joy and ecstasy, laughter ringing out as the women danced in tandem -- a swirl of color, of grace, of quick steps, of smiling faces as they gave into the rush of their heart beats and the lusty night in their veins. Flowers began to rain down among them all.Quick clapping from the Rondi citizens as the parade began down the streets, watching as the women twirled, as the brightly-decorated guitars and instruments came down the streets and then huge floats -- propelled by magic came down, covered in bright feathers and flowers and glitter as skulls and skeletons danced in the streets---- bursts of fireworks overhead worked in tandem with the quick pace of the music, but no one ever lost sight of \"LaMuerta\" e \"LoSueno\" as they swirled around each other, until finally -- they ended in each other's arms.And as they did, the music stopped -- but only for a sudden BURST of flame as down LaDanza, ten spirits burst from the underground, full of fire, their headdresses reaching toward the sky, towering over all of the rest...As they moved with the rest of the parade. It was night out, but it was not dark, and within the eyes of those who wore the mask or the paint, they could see so many spirits and ghosts traveling with the parade, dancing with their living loved ones, filling dooways, looking at their escrisuenos.They danced and they celebrated and they loved with their families and friends.

She looked more alive in that she was clearly not a vampire, and less alive in that she was a ghost. The spirit seemed to fade away. How odd. It didn't seem interested in the party...\"Oh! Hi...\" Jun said, slightly stunned, when Skarlet returned to her. \"Umm... Umm...

After getting a good feel from the hug she releases and talks about her encounter. \"Did you see her? That was C\u00e9line, she was me before I was me... you get it?

Her bird-like singing could only be faintly heard over the music as she danced in mid air.  However, when the parade made a sharp turn, Cheesecake failed to notice and accidentally began wandering off into the graveyard.  Only once the beat had become soft did she open her eyes again and look around.  Where had the parade gone?  She let out a confused chirp as she looked around to get her bearings.  She was quite exhausted from that dancing, now that she thought about it.  Floating over to a tombstone, she sat down on it and put her head on her hands to rest.  Eventually she would get back up and move, but for now she listened to the muffled songs and lights in the background as her wings gently fluttered with her rushed breathing.", "link_list": ["/user/2185"], "image_list": [], "html": "Having managed to elude Riley's grasps with her dancing, Cheesecake followed the parade as it wound around the city, fully engrossed in the music.

Skarlet just lived.\"How about this, A man works all his life to build the house of his dreams but dies before he can enjoy it. But instead of the house being abandoned, his son inherits the property and family fortune and lives on with it all. This body is the estate that I inherited.\"When she thought of it this way it made sense to Skarlet. She considered the analogy even further, thinking about redecorating and adding expansions like an extra wing to the house; equating to her vampire abilities and that her appearance altered to have red eyes and fangs. After thinking about it for a while longer she wonders how Jun received it and she returns her attention. She hoped Jun was following what she meant and that the analogy wasn't lost in translation. Skarlet herself feels a little ditzy and bubbly, which was unusual for the normally macabre girl.
