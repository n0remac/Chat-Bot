He traced his fingers in it. He looked at the stream again, noticing a large school of fish passing, his trained eyes stared at them for a quick second before he pointed his finger and at one. \"Blessings of the Ice Mother, grant my prey a quick and painless release.\" A bolt of ice shot from his finger skewering the fish, killing it instantly.
