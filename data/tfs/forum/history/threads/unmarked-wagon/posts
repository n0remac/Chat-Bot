He had heard of the gent from one of the city guards, one of the first diplomats to arrive in Ivelius for the Conflagration.Such eagerness, Regulus remembered deciding, was a good sign for his ultimate goal of entrenching Ivelius in the global community. But eagerness to bed with Ivelius didn't spring from nothing. In this stage, it had seemed, an outsider throwing in with Ivelius was a political burial. 'Apologist,' Regulus hypothesized, did not begin to cover it. For a move like that, the gentleman was either very, very ambitious, or very, very short-sighted.Regulus would take either.He turned to his helmet, resting on the bench, and palmed it firmly in hand. He held it out the window, angling it carefully, watching the sun bounce back at the man in a bright ray. All but his hand and helm was concealed behind a curtain.
