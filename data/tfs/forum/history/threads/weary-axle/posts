Short version, six months ago in a fit of rage I slaughtered every living soul in a remote village. The event was evidently\u00a0traumatizing\u00a0enough, to cause me to block it out. I eventually unearthed the memories, and returned to the village. I spent roughly two weeks burying every body in the village, then another two sitting around waiting to die. My determination to die in the mountains alone, like I deserve to, was shattered when a circus showed up.\"\"Multiple members of the circus, attempted to cheer me up, and convince me I am not in fact a monster. While I disagreed with them I came to two conclusions. First I could be something other than a monster. I have elected to focus on helping people, I hope this will lead to some kind of\u00a0redemption. Second I needed to get off the mountain, because weird things kept happening.\"\"I departed the circus, accompanied by a member. Takhana. A seer, and pyromancer who had decided to move on. Yesterday, we encountered some gnolls attacking a group of merchants. Another performer from the circus showed up, also a pyromancer, named Cynder. Working together he dispatched the gnolls, with only one of us Cynder sustaining serious injury. Fortunatly one of the merchant we rescued was a healer, and she was able to treat the wound. Afterward we stopped at an inn, which is my current location. Last night I engaged in sexual congress with Cynder, it was both our first times, and we have started a relationship. I am happy about this, though very worried as well.\"\"In regards to your problem, I can set out for Isra\u00a0immediately.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<i>\"Nothing in particular, just everyone I have done since I left.

Sione had given them to him and he didn't want them to rot away like the clothes he had before.\u00a0 \u00a0His ribs felt a little better in the tub. The warm water soothed the injury, though there was a large bruise, dark with purple and yellow just along the bottom of his rib cage. He touched the bruise gingerly and it hurt quite a bit. He had had bruises before, but none this big. He decided he probably shouldn't touch it very much since it hurt every time he did.\u00a0 \u00a0After washing the clothes to his own satisfaction, he rested his back against the read of the tub.

Though there are four things I feel I must bring to your attention. The first is your law of beheading for damaging a crop, I think it is a little strict. Scratch that, far too strict. It sounds like a man only has to damage a single stalk of corn results in death. I implore that you rethink your laws, mainly for the second reason. Your culture, will have to change from your Bushido code and the old ways of the Samurai. I do not say to forget what has made you who you are today, but it is easier for 5 men to change their views, then an entire country. Third, if you have a map of Fareen, I can point out some suitable locations for the startup you are looking for. The location should be far enough out of the way that the current monarchy and surrounding countries won't notice you at first. However, as you grow they will notice, and it won't just be the fractured monarchy going after you. My final suggestion here, is to seek out a friend of mine. He also won't require fiefdoms as he has his own plans, not as grand as making a country, but just a village where his kind can be safe. I think he was talking about taking some job in some gemstone cavern. Afterwards he should be traveling through Goraia I believe, so it is only a slight detour to get him.
