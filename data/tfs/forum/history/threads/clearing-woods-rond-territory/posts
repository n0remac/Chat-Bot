She had seemingly appeared from thin air, standing between two trees roughly twenty feet from the gathering. \"The dragon is a blight to this world\" her voice sounded. There was purity, divine resonance and a feminine innocence to her voice. It was almost like hearing a child speak, except there was promise of terrible power in her tone of voice. \"It cannot be controlled by any mortal mans means. It cannot be slain by any blade or vanquished easily by any common sorcerer\" she muttered. \"It is an ancient Elder dragon from the north. Its lifetime has seen the rise and fall of civilization far beyond recorded history. Do you not stop to think that someone of equal if not greater power had tried to smite it before? I will remind you that it was smaller then... Weaker\" She said, her crystal clear eyes flickering across the group. Her bare feet took her closer, barely making any noise as she moved closer - her white gown sliding silently across the leaves of the forest floor. \"I have seen it... The dragons fire embracing every nook and cranny of these woods. I have also seen it prosper in pure tranquility with all of the neighboring humans. I have seen numerous outcomes to the task at hand. Know that if there is even a slight chance of the dragon turning on the people of Rond\u00f3n and the creatures of these woods, it has to be destroyed\" \"Dragons are selfish creatures. If it does not feel appreciated... Worshiped even it will turn its terrible wroth on everyone around it and relish in their treasures. Why do you think the dragon has come down here? The weather? Rond\u00f3n is one of the richest cities in the known world. Its riches beyond imagination\" She had a worried expression on her face \"The dragon -will- destroy everything around it, there are recordings through histories of these beasts and their cruel nature. They have not a shed of empathy for anything living but their kin. The love that they profess to have for creatures around them is comparable to the relationship of master and slave, owner and pet\" She sat calmly beside the fire \"I offer you my service in this task, it is my duty as guardian of these woods to protect it, even against this seemingly unbeatable foe\" ", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Emilia, Lady of the Wood came out of nowhere.
