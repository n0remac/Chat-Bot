The pieces are the sizes of people. Across the room sits a little boy, his chair padded so that the two of you can see eye to eye. The boy appears kind, holding a teddy bear that is missing one eye.

He could've been imagining it, it was that clear to him. The words being spoken, the facial expression of the Warlord. It was endless information, all flowing freely.

It was a Saturday morning. That girl that I drew... She's still there... Centuries ago in the past. I'm staring at her right now\" He closed his eyes, his facial expression becoming somewhat\u00a0solemn. \"The girl is getting up now... She's done playing\" He told himself, standing completely still in front of the bookshelf.\u00a0\"In three seconds I close the book... Then I walk further down the aisle\"\u00a0\"Two... One\" He closed the book, initiating a slow walk down the side of the bookshelf. \"I'm still there... Drawing the girl\" he thought, his fingers tracing across the many books. \"I've tired of thinking about the girl now... I open that book again in seven years and eighty-four days\".\u00a0\"I let my feet carry me down the aisle, but they know just as well as me where I'm going\". B\u00e9liar stopped in front of a stool, randomly placed between two stacks of paper. \"When do I die?\" He asked himself out loud, peering at the chair. Before he asked the question, he already knew the answer. It was always there with him. How did he find motivation and purpose again? He didn't know. His life was an endless stream of\u00a0information\u00a0and impulse. The emotion he experienced were sparks from a worn down piece of flint, desperately attempting to light the fire that was himself.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<font face=\"times new roman\">B\u00e9liar's face was blank, his eyes speeding across the pages of a book he had written years ago. Whilst he read the book he was keeping an \"eye\" on the conversation between The Watcher and Nishida, the\u00a0imagery\u00a0flowing freely in his mind much like a memory would. He could've been imagining it, it was that clear to him. The words being spoken, the facial expression of the Warlord. It was endless information, all flowing freely. He knew what was to be and what had been, but how did he not bore himself into madness with an all seeing eye? He\u00a0desperately\u00a0tried to remember. Had he cast this tendency to forget on himself? Was that even possible? He did not know, he did not remember. He closed the book with a snap, peering to the left. There was an endless amount of books here... All the information one could wish for in one lifetime, or a thousand.\u00a0<br><br/><br/>\"Sense... Sense... Sense...\" He repeated to himself, placing the book back into the slot he had pulled it from. Was the first day of his life one without a sky? Without a moon and without the stars?\u00a0<br/><br/><br/>\"My history has taken place only in appearance, never literally\" He scribbled into a piece of paper, leaving it where he had found it. \"In twenty seconds I will open a book, and in the book there will be a drawing of a child seated in a meadow\" He realized. \"10 seconds now...\" He realized, walking towards a bookshelf. There was no point in fighting it. Refusing to open said book would be pointless, it would change nothing. \"The book is in my hand, and surely enough the girl is seated in a meadow\" He glanced at the page.\u00a0<br/><br/><br/>\"I drew this two-hundred and sixty-two years ago. It was a Saturday morning. That girl that I drew... She's still there... Centuries ago in the past. I'm staring at her right now\" He closed his eyes, his facial expression becoming somewhat\u00a0solemn. \"The girl is getting up now... She's done playing\" He told himself, standing completely still in front of the bookshelf.\u00a0<br/><br/>\"In three seconds I close the book... Then I walk further down the aisle\"\u00a0<br/><br/><br/>\"Two... One\" He closed the book, initiating a slow walk down the side of the bookshelf. \"I'm still there... Drawing the girl\" he thought, his fingers tracing across the many books. \"I've tired of thinking about the girl now... I open that book again in seven years and eighty-four days\".\u00a0<br/><br/><br/>\"I let my feet carry me down the aisle, but they know just as well as me where I'm going\".
