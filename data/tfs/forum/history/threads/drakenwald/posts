Jon-Jon drew his bow and tugged on the string a few times, like he had done just before they exited the city.  He felt for his quiver, then his knives, then his pouch, and ensured his furs were all wrapped tightly around him.  When this was done he pulled out a flask; on one side was a yellow stripe.  He pulled out the plug and sprinkled some yellowish liquid on his palm.  He went about rubbing up on his hands and through his hair, then on his clothes.He handed it over to Roxanne.  \"Piss,\" he said plainly.  \"Rub it on you real good, just like I did.  Masks your smell.\"As the duo started trekking into the forest Jon-Jon alternated his focus on what lie ahead and his immediate surroundings.  He would rub his hands on the ground, in some random leaves, or across tree bark.  He specifically stopped to smell water, or investigate the lay of mud.  Each time he sighed and shook his head disappointingly and moved on.Ultimately he came to a sudden drop.  Down below was a mire; brown, watery pools littered the ground, with green grasses sticking up in various places.  The sun was not visible, so the day was coming to an end.  Roxanne would notice Jon-Jon snugging himself up nearby a treestump.\"Night falls,\" he said quietly.  \"No fire tonight.  Attracts unwanted attention.\"  Jon-Jon had wore a great deal of furs with him, so he'd stay warm anyway.  If Roxanne did not have the proper attire she would grow miserably cold, in which case Jon-Jon would shed some of his own fur for the lady.As the night came all sound in the forest seemed to vanish.

Giant serpents, were-wolves, monstrous spiders...the most dangerous thing, though, has got to be the hydra. It lived in the sea, and each head grew back as fast as you could cut it. It almost sank our ship, but we managed to harpoon it and keep it at the surface. We tried shooting it full of arrows, but it refused to die. To kill it, we ended up having to spread oil over the water and light it aflame. Almost burned the boat, too. How about you, Jon-Jon? What sort of beasts have you brought home to stuff and mount? Besides, what are we hunting right now? What could possibly be out there that's so dangerous that we can't have a fire?\"She shivered again.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Roxanne's sword had been taken from her by the guards, and was likely in the hands of some hooded thug.

Snakes are troublesome sometimes.\"She chuckled at his comment about belonging in a castle, before shivering in a cold. At least a castle would likely have a nice warm hearth, or a blanket at the very least.\"I've never been one for castles, Jon-Jon. I certainly didn't grow up in one. I was born in Asgeir, in a village called Taavi. My father...he wasn't from around there, and he didn't stick around. My mother raised me and my little brother all by herself. She was a monster hunter too, and wrestled bears for fun. Unfortunately, she passed away from illness when we were both young, and we had to leave the village to go look for my father. We didn't find him until years and years afterwards, but we did manage to get to his family's estate. Gran took us in and raised us both, which is why we go by the family name Fletcher. It's for Gran, not my father. Anyways, I really always wanted to become a monster hunter. Luckily, Gran used to be one as well, and my Uncle Renalt was a dragonslayer before he retired. Both of them taught me enough for me to go out on my own and learn the rest on the job. It's been rough, but I wouldn't rather do anything else. And I definitely wouldn't want to sit around in a castle.\"She laughed, imagining a life as a noble. How dull it would all be, sitting around doing nothing all day!\"What about you, Jon-Jon?
