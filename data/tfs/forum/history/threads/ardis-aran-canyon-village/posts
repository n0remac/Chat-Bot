Still, something had woken him up and the place had been deserted when he got there, so he found himself immediately cautious and curious as to who - or what - was outside. He carefully and quietly stood up, his sword in his hand for defence as he crept out towards where a hole in the wall created an entrance. He hid by it, peeking outside and trying to find the source of the noise.
