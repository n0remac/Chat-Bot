It was a strange feeling, unlike the one that had overtaken him in the misty seas, and this one seemed much less threatening -- in fact, it felt enticing. This calling consumed him easily enough, and he only thought of reaching the source, he could feel it in his bones, the direction he had to go. He traveled in a rather straight line through the terrain whenever he could, he did not know where to find roads or where they led to. His travels were plagued with gaps in his memory, with surroundings changed when he regained his awareness. He always felt reinvigorated when he awoke in these new landscapes as well, and always he felt much closer than before.Soon, he awoke in a desert, surrounded only by seas of sand and craggy red cliffs. Not even the red cliffs offered any shade in the hot desert. Enigma already felt near his limit by the time mid day came about, but he felt so unbearably close. He could only hope there was water there as he stumbled along the dunes, his bare feet burning in the hot sands. As he continued following the route, which was all but invisible but Enigma could feel, he would soon find himself in a completely different land, having not perceived the change of scenery as it happened. When he found himself in the midst of a forest he paused for a moment to look around, he was indeed in the midst of a forest, not even a hint of the sands or hot sun from before could be seen. This had happened to him previously, but unbeknownst to him there was no gap in time, he had just walked into this area.The cool shade of the trees and light breeze were a welcome relief, but his mouth and throat were still bone dry, so when he spotted a pool ahead of him he immediately made his way to it, drinking deeply from the cool waters.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Ever since Enigma had washed ashore on a coastline near the NTC trade routes, almost near death, he felt something pulling at him.
