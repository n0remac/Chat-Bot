Well, almost all that remained. A single watch tower, all that remained of the Royal Palace, reared its faded bulk over the booming surf of the Dawn Sea. It was covered in flowering creepers and its mortar had long since faded away, but it was a stronghold of sorts, and it was theirs. A quartet of guards in black ringmail and long fur cloaks guarded the entrance, armed with war spears and long axes, dirks hanging at their sides. They watched the goings on in the rude little colony from under blackened half-helms, a crude little eagle carved from garnet set in to the nasal bar. These were the \"knights\" of Arden -- young and undisciplined, but loyal and eager to serve.In the drafty, spider and bat infested halls of the Lonely Tower lived Lanceron Medan IV, youngest (and quite possibly the last) King of Arden. His family had been reduced to tribal bandits and chieftains living up in the hills of western Arden, battling other noble families in the last days of the kingdom's decline. Now, the young king had gathered up a hundred or so followers and descended in to the ruins of Brimiarde. He'd established a colony and a reputation as a strong, bold leader of men, and he bore the sword and crown of his forefathers. He awaited the coming of more tribes and warriors of Arden, of heroes that would help him carve out a mighty kingdom from the wilderness.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The mighty river Ithiper gushed past New Brimiarde, a roaring torrent fed even more by the winter rains.

The sun was starting to sink low in the sky and the whole place had a pink glow about it. She walked down the well-trodden stone path from the main town to the docks. There were more than a couple handfuls of fishing boats, as well as two larger trading ships. She figured that the boat they were seeking was one of the larger ones. Given that there were only two options, she didn't have much of a choice in where to look first. Going down the dock on the left, she smiled to herself as her footsteps echoed down on the water as she moved further off-shore. There were tall, burly men carrying supplies or loads of cargo up and down the docks around her, but she didn't bother to duck out of the way unless absolutely necessary. She carried herself with purpose and dignity as she approached the large ship.There was a man in somewhat finer garb shouting orders up to the ship and Arella assumed he was in charge. She strode up to him, paused, and waited for him to finish yelling before she cleared her throat to get his attention.\"Ay?\" he asked, giving her a squinted look. \"What's a miss like you doing on these docks?\"\"I'm a representative of Princess Camilla. I am traveling with some companions and a ship, possibly yours, should be expecting us. We are on our way out to the islands. Would this be the correct ship?\" Arella seemed to slip into the mode of giving orders and diplomacy easily. It was a familiar place for her, and she had more than a few times been faced with uncooperative folk.\"Oh, I see. Well I'm sorry to say, but you've got the wrong ship. We are on our way down south along the coast, not out to the deep.\" Arella's eyes widened for a moment as her mind reeled uncontrollably. A split second later, she regained herself and ran her hand through her hair.\"South? When are you leaving? I will be in town for a day or two and I have a letter that I would like delivered down there. If it's no trouble, would you be able to take it?\" She was less of a diplomat now and was now asking an honest question. The captain hummed for a minute, looking her up and down and thinking.\"I think I can do that. We set sail tomorrow, just after sunrise. You'll have to be quick about getting me that letter. I won't wait around.\" Arella nodded, thanking him graciously before walking off and to the other ship. This one was the ship they were supposed to meet, evidently. The crew looked a lot smaller and a lot cleaner when she got an up-close examination. This captain was more gentleman than seaman, which was an interesting puzzle. According to the schedule, they were set to leave as soon as the three wished. They had been given an estimated arrival date, but had not planned on preparing to leave until their guests had actually shown up. Given this, Arella requested that they depart the day after next, giving them two nights of rest and one full day to recuperate before starting the second leg of their journey.With her business completed, she began the trek back up into town. The sun was setting now, so she quickened her pace to keep from getting caught out in the dark. She wasn't afraid of what may be lurking in the night, but she wanted to sit down and get her letter written quickly in hopes of catching more than a couple hours of sleep.<Exit to Inn>", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<i>&lt;Enter from Inn&gt;</i>"}, "post-2199": {"user": "USQUE AR HARA", "user_num": 85, "timestamp": "1431110217000", "message": "The Morning Star - The ship that would be taking the party to the islands is now seaworthy again after a storm hit and repairs were to be made.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i488.photobucket.com/albums/rr250/beaniechick1983/forum/download.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://i488.photobucket.com/albums/rr250/beaniechick1983/forum/download.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/><br><br/><br/>The Morning Star - The ship that would be taking the party to the islands is now seaworthy again after a storm hit and repairs were to be made.</br></div>"}, "post-2271": {"user": "Silas", "user_num": 139, "timestamp": "1431277034000", "message": "<Enter from Old Inn>At the harbor there was only one large ship tied to the dock.

The winds of change were blowing, he could feel it, and with change came uncertainty. Uncertainty he could profit from. For quite a while he had quieted his operation as the world settled into a quasi-peaceful state, but now was the time to reopen old doorways and start taking new deals. The old city of Brimiarde had once housed an entrance to his personal offices, back when he had been at his peak, but with the ruin of the city came the loss of that doorway. Around the same time, in fact, he had lost a great many of his access points to the world. Now was his chance to reestablish them.Ignatius walked the docks, gaining a few wary looks from the dockhands and captains, but he paid them little mind. He strolled past the ships and vessels, heading farther back towards the section of the docks that was still in disrepair. Abandoned shops and homes littered the strip of waterfront, all abandoned for years. He passed fewer and fewer people as he walked, until he reached the end of the dock. Here sat a small abandoned storefront surrounded by two crumbling buildings. The glass was long gone, as was the door, and the roof was caving in. Closing his eyes, he could remember when it had once been a busy little shop where fences and thieves bartered over stolen loot and heist plans. Ah... I miss those days...

It glowed dimly, the magic having faded after many long years of disuse, and after a minute it moved aside, grinding on the stone next to it. Another necessary repair. He silently cursed at how much work needed to be done, but with that odd man Itzal taking care of the crypt, he had time now. As he climbed a revealed ladder down into the darkness of the pit, he thought about the man he had just made a deal with. He was powerful, that much was obvious, quite probably more powerful than himself. And that girl he had pulled out was no cakewalk either. The one advantage that Ignatius had was the contract. Because Itzal had willingly used his blood to sign, and with his blood came a small bit of his essence, it meant that the contract could be enforced in the case of a betrayal. It probably couldn't kill him, but crippling him and his power was well within the realm of possibility. Still, he'd rather things remain friendly between them. He needed more allies, and while he would probably never trust Itzal entirely, that didn't mean they couldn't work together. He'd just have to be... Cautious.His eyes adjusted to the darkness, glowing red in the pitch black room. Looking around, it wasn't hard to spot what he was looking for. A large mirror stretched floor to ceiling across from the ladder. The edges were a simple blackened iron, except for directly above the center, which showed the symbol of Ignatius' business: the jackal head. Stepping forward, he placed one gloved hand on the mirror. It was definitely still dormant, but had seemed to avoid any damage over the years. He grinned, and breathed on the mirror, leaving a thin film of fog on it. He quickly traced an elaborate jackal head symbol on it, and as the last lines connected, the mirror sprung to life, filling the room in a soft glow like torchlight. Pulling back his hand, he chuckled. \"Nothing like going home again.\" And with that, he stepped through the shimmering surface.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<Enter from Old Crypt>"}, "post-3536": {"user": "Bryn", "user_num": 290, "timestamp": "1433340359000", "message": "<Enter from House Lorenza> Bryn had attempted to track the girl down her route to the harbour. He followed her tracks right to the end of the docks, in old store front that he recognised from the old city. He tasted metal in his mouth and a buzz through his hands and feet. Magic. Where-ever the girl was, she had gotten herself entangled in the world of magic. Bryn new the experience all too well, and looked at his wrist, a nearly 300 year old scar still stung fresh on his skin. His brow furrowed. Nothing would stop him reaching that girl. She was not making his mistakes. He would die before he allowed her to make a deal with the Devil. Bryn entered the old storefront, but the girl was nowhere to be seen. His thoughts were interrupted by the sound of stone grinding on stone and as he followed the sound to it's source, he saw a glowing tile slowly recovering the entrance of what he assumed was a well-kept secret. If the girl had gone anywhere it was here. Bryn was still agile, even with his slowly ageing body, and managed to slip into the opening just as the tile closed firmly above his head. \"Won't be leaving through there I guess\" he thought to himself. All that was in the room bellow him was a full length mirror as tall as the room was high. At it's top Bryn noticed a symbol that made his blood boil with rage. A Jackal Head. He knew instantly what this mirror was, and noticed it still shimmering slightly from the girl... \u00a0who had just step through it. Bryn stretched out his arm with hesitancy, but tried to push it through the shimmering surface. Energy pulse through his muscles and he cried out in pain.

Zuu lands on a nearby roof, casting a glamour to make her appear as a lovely middle-class dock-worker's daughter, barely 18, if that, wearing a well-kempt fluffy navy blue dress with a brown corset that pushes her bosom up quite nicely and a pair of worn shoes, complete with shear white stockings, her crimson hair tied up into a little bow-shaped bun where it was straight before, the excess hair falling down into a ponytail. Her fangs have retreated, leaving a row of perfectly normal, lovely white teeth. She is the picture of innocence, and yet exudes an aura of desirability.She slides down into the nearby alley, inserting herself into the crowd of the docks as she searches for her prey, tapping a nearby dockworker on the shoulder. When he turns around, she smiles innocently up at him. \"Sir, I'm looking for my dad. He's clothed in sorta beat up linens, he's got scratch marks. He'd have been running this way. My mommy got all mad at him and scared him off! Can you help me find him?\" she asks, her voice soft and adorable. The dockworker, a broad, masculine man, grins wickedly and nods, \"'E went tha' way, luv,\" he says, pointing to a broken pier near the edge of the harbour, \"but I kin show ye a shortcut so y'can go 'round all dese people. Dere's a big shipment comin' in soon, 's why thar's so many.\" She smiles brightly and says, happily, \"Sure, mister! Thanks a lot!\"He wraps his arm about her shoulders, groping at her chest as he leads her into the alleyway. When they get there, he pushes her up against a wall, beginning to unlace her corset. She looks up at him with a pouty, but unconcerned frown. \"What are you doing?\" she asks, sadly, \"are you being naughty?\" The worker doesn't respond, so instead of words, she resorts to what she does best. as her glamour begins to fade, her long, powerful wings stretch out before her, and she grasps the man by his throat. \"Now now, mister, you shouldn't go about preying on little pretty girls,\" she says, grinning as she lifts him up by his jugular, flapping her wings heavily to hover a few feet above the ground. \"See, now you're gonna be a tasty treat for me!\" she continues, smiling happily as she takes him back into the alleyway, receding into darkness. Nary a scream can be heard from him, just a sickening splatter of blood along the walls, the sound of flesh being ripped and his lifeblood being drained. A few minutes later, the little dockworker's daughter can be seen returning from the alleyway, skipping along with her little bow-bun bouncing with her and licking her fingers clean of what looks like raspberry juice, her lips stained slightly more red than before. Innocence personified.Zuu makes her way to the beat up pier, tearing the door from the boathouse like a child's toy and grinning down at her prey, who cowers in the corner like a beaten puppy. Her glamour fades once again, her true nature revealed as she grins wickedly, her long, bloodied fangs glistening in the light. She hisses and descends upon her mark, his screams prematurely cut off by a hissing sound, like a pierced hose.In the morning, the authorities will find the man pinned up against the wooden wall by his own sharpened femur impaled through his chest, his throat slashed and his blood almost entirely drained, although quite a bit of it seems to be sprayed all over the walls around the shack. The perpetrator of the crime will never be found, and this case will fade into obscurity as an unsolvable mystery, a double murder never to be unravelled. Zuu, meanwhile, watches the investigation from a nearby treetop with pleasure, studying the guards with interest. She wonders which will be next as she spreads her wings and rockets off above the clouds, shielding her eyes from the oppressive sun as she returns to places unknown.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The night is cool and crisp, and the skies are alight with stars, twinkling bright in the moonless void, broken only occasionally by a passing dark, wispy cloud.
