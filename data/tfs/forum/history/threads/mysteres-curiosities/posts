Nobody can remember seeing it there before, but it has the old and weathered look of one that has been there for decades. The proprietor is...eccentric. He always wears a mask and bright, gaudy clothing. And his wares are equally strange, and rather unsettling, to tell the truth. He sells beautiful masks made of metal, wood, leather, all sorts of materials. Racks upon racks of masks, and no two the same. There are kings, queens, and jesters. Cats and dogs and monkeys. Birds, dragons, bats. All sorts. Besides the masks, the shop owner also makes and sells marionettes, mannequins, dolls, and small clockwork curiosities such as music boxes and singing birds.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/lCUIQbR.jpg", "http://i.imgur.com/j49G7co.png", "http://i.imgur.com/bZC7NJJ.jpg", "http://i.imgur.com/Sp6GzQt.jpg", "http://i.imgur.com/nIclA27.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/lCUIQbR.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/>"}, "post-13182": {"user": null, "user_num": null, "timestamp": "1444336840000", "message": "A short man, not even 4 feet in height, walked into the store with his hands hidden by his cloak.

Yes, that's it. Alice slipped on the dress, looking over in a nearby mirror to observe how well it fit her. The small white dress was a sleeveless; white collared dress, with a black ribbon on the front of the collar, a black and silver ribbon around the middle that was tied in a ribbon as well. It was one of those dresses where the wearer could just slip it on without having to untie the ribbon, both black lace and a black stripe around the bottom of the skirt.\u00a0\"I was nothing, and now I'm something, father? That is...odd.\" She laughed quietly, still looking in the mirror. Her long blonde hair swept down her back, bangs framing her face, the reflection of her gentle sky blue eyes staring back at her.\u00a0", "link_list": ["/post/16301/thread"], "image_list": ["//storage.proboards.com/6046952/images/uCQvKjMwQCSfGa7d4dCT.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@masquerade\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/16301/thread\" timestamp=\"1447734807\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-0\" title=\"masquerade\"><img alt=\"masquerade Avatar\" src=\"//storage.proboards.com/6046952/images/uCQvKjMwQCSfGa7d4dCT.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/16301/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1447734807000\" title=\"Nov 16, 2015 20:33:27 GMT -8\">Nov 16, 2015 20:33:27 GMT -8</abbr></a>  @masquerade said:</div>\"Ah, excellent!\"<br><br/>Masquerade leans over the doll on the table, smiling.
