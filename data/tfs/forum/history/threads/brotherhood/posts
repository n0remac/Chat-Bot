protection of civilians and innocents.\u00a0 The order owns and maintains a number of orphanages, hospitals, and chapels that are ready and willing to assist the locals in any way they can.\u00a0 They owe no allegiance to any single nation.\u00a0 While a great number of Angelist monks and clerics can be found throughout the Overworld, the Brotherhood is most known for its military branch, the Knight-Brothers, colloquially known as the Knights of the Black Cross, or more simply the Brothers.The Knight-Brothers are highly-trained, well-equipped, and disciplined knights drawn from all over the Overworld.\u00a0 They are known to wear white tabards with black crosses, with matching capes.\u00a0 They may wear chainmail or steel plate armor, and wield an array of weapons, most notably swords.\u00a0 Each Knight-Brother is trained in the use of holy magic, usually wards that can protect them against all types of fire, darkness, and related effects, and specialize in healing and empowering allies.The Knight-Brothers are small in number, and so fill their ranks with squires, men-at-arms, mercenaries, and volunteers when necessary.\u00a0 They are not, however, an actual military force.\u00a0 The Brothers' sole purpose is the protection of Angelists and other innocents, as well as the priests of their order.\u00a0 The Hochmeister does have the power to conduct extensive military campaigns, and he has exercised this power before.\u00a0 Most Knight-Brothers may take on the role of journeymen, who roam the world in search of opportunities to make the world a better place.Ranks:\u00a0 All members of the order have the opportunity to become any rank listed; ranks are exchanged at the general conclaves.Hochmeister - The Hochmeister is the grandmaster of the Brotherhood, the highest rank attainable for the Knights.\u00a0 The Hochmeister has the power to enact new policies, conduct military and political campaigns, and more.\u00a0 He has supreme rule of the entire order.\u00a0 Hochmeisters are elected by a general conclave for a permitted amount of time.OrdenMarschall - The OrdenMarschall is the second-in-command of the Brotherhood, usually a close friend or adviser to the Hochmeister.\u00a0 He has virtually the same amount of power as the Hochmeister, but his role is usually to offer advice or to execute specific commands for the Hochmeister.Grand Komtur - A Grand Komtur is a Komtur given extended power over a specific region, and commands several garrisons there, and maintains control over several Komturs within that region.\u00a0 This rank is usually given to trusted members who can oversee the actions of a region while the Hochmeister needs to handle other affairs.Komtur - A Komtur is a garrison and military commander.\u00a0 They are usually in command of a unit of Knight-Brothers, and exercise their power in around their garrison.\u00a0 Komturs are expected to lead their knights in battle.Halbruders - Halbruders are members of the order who are not exactly knights.\u00a0 This title can be used for squires and sergeants.LocationsIsranian HopsiceThe Phoenix State HospiceAsgeir HospiceArburg

headquarters.[OrdenMarschall] Dietrich 'the Sadist' - Dietrich is the best friend of Konrad, and the first OrdenMarschall.\u00a0 Dietrich is a highly dangerous, unpredictable man, known for his

Audria", "user_num": 491, "timestamp": "1460164457000", "message": "History of the BrotherhoodThe Brotherhood can actually trace its beginnings to the Swavian Rebellion, a bloody war that occurred in the southwestern region of Vessia.  During this time, the Swavian noble family rebelled against the Vessian Emperor; the Emperor responded by mobilizing the full force of his military and employing the dreaded Vessian Knights.  Control over the Swavian fief was vital, for it not only supplied fertile farmlands, it also housed a commerce-rich trade route and held invaluable resources.  Control over this spit of land would determine who held the most power within the region, and so the Vessian Emperor was not keen on losing it.Ultimately, however, the Emperor's lack of attention on his northeastern border proved troublesome.  A neighboring people, known as the Wickans, raided a number of villages and towns, and even plundered major population centers in the area.  Many homes were burned and many public buildings reduced to rubble.  The population was raped, slaughtered, and enslaved by the Wickans, who retreated back into their native Eastwick just as quickly as they came into Vessia.The Swavian Rebellion came to a close with a Vessian victory.  But when the victorious nobles and their remaining men returned home to the northeast, they found the sacked remains of their homes.  These nobles wished to raise a new army and attack Eastwick, but the rest of the country suffered from war weariness after the Swavian Rebellion. The Emperor also refused to act, in fear that Eastwick might declare all out war and overrun his battle-worn armies.This did not stop some Vessians from taking vengeance, however.  The most notable avenger was Konrad IV von Marschburg, a noble.  Konrad rallied a number of knights, most of whom were friends, such as Dietrich the Sadist.  These knights were on the warpath and headed directly into Eastwick, attracting a large number of vengeful peasants.  Together, the knights and the peasants led brutal attacks on the Wickan frontier, slaughtering all they came across and burning whole villages.The force of avengers had to return to Vessia and recuperate, but they were unfortunately arrested by the Emperor and his Imperial Guard.  The Emperor had to do this to ease the tension between himself and the Wickan king, or else war would break out.  Konrad and his men laid down their arms, as they were vastly outnumbered.  The peasants were disbanded and the knights arrested; they would have wait for trial and would no doubt be executed.Then High King Ulfr of Asgeir arrived in Vessia.  His lands had also been plagued by Wickan raiders, and he sought to fight this menace.  Ulfr suggested to the Emperor an order of monks be formed to convert these pagans into Angelists.  To protect them, a branch of knights would need to be formed.  And so the Brotherhood was founded.  Ulfr suggested that the convict, Konrad, and all his loyal knights be released to lead the order.  The Emperor agreed.What began was the Wickan Crusade.  The new Hochmeister and his knights were not exactly keen on converting the pagans, and instead swept across Eastwick with profound effect.  Soon enough the Wickan lands were conquered and mostly depopulated.  The Brothers would raid the villages and force the occupants to renounce their pagan ways, or they would be put to the sword.  Those who agreed to convert would be taken elsewhere, where they would be assimilated into Vessian culture.After the Wickan Crusade, Hochmeister Konrad sent his seasoned Knight-Brothers throughout the Overworld to obtain rights and chapter houses for the Brothers.  This was a wild success and before long the Brothers had rights in all the major kingdoms of the Overworld.Komtur Adrian participated in the defense of the Free City when Red Fletcher and her Bottle Demons attacked.  Komtur Heinrich observed the battle between the Phoenix State and Aaedan.  Konrad and Dietrich defended themselves from Ivelian miscreants.Ultimately, the Brothers relocated to the Eastern March, a stretch of forest east of the Free City (now Isra).  Here, they defeated a massive force of Wickans under the command of General Vykas.  The Brotherhood relied on the Atlanticus Navy, led by Giplor, and a number of mercenaries.  The Battle of Vorstuga River was a decisive one, and staved off Wickan attacks on the Free City.  However, the Brothers went into hiatus after this and a peaceful period passed.Now the Brothers seek to establish a new headquarters in the state of Goraia and build their forces, while searching for the long-lost relic known as the Scripture.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<div align=\"center\">History of the Brotherhood</div>"}}
