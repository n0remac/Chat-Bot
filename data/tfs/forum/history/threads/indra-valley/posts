The magical gems were calling after all. Jill removed her charm from their weapons. Jun noticed a very distinct sense of relief when this was done. She figured perhaps this was a normal part of owning a weapon, since she had never really had a melee weapon before. But the macuahuitl had really grown on her and felt like a part of her. So why shouldn't she be relieved that the weapon now had its edge restored?!After all, it's not like the club was alive or anything.The party enjoyed their sunny day until they left the valley.<Jill, Jun, and Camilla, who yes was technically here, all exit for the Usque.>", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "(Since we agree to close up)"}}
