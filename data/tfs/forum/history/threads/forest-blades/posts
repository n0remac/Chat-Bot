In his pain, he sought a solution to the hole in his heart.  Women were easily bought, with money or power, and he took many wives, where he had once had but one.  But none of them cared for him.  His pleasure was greater than any man, but the joy of it left him.  Sullen and enraged, he drove them from his house, to perish in the desert sands.  Next, he turned to conquest.
