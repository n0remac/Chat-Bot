The Grand Phoenixian Lai Ban      , one of the newly appointed spiritual leaders of the legendary Children of the Red Phoenix, had received the intel via the power of the Chaos Phoenix. Also, apparently a spy by the name of Rictzin Vauc'Druhr      , a sort of supernatural creature, had managed to sneak into the borders of Medan some time ago. He too had relayed intel about the situation in Medan, and it was not good.And so a great many would gather, mostly young men and women and a few grand sages. Most of them would arrive on the backs of buffalo, yaks, and other creatures native to their land. Some more would arrive on horses and the newly introduced war rhinos.The Land-Tiller's Expanse was known for being peaceful, and for the most part their ways were untouched. However, the price they paid for becoming subservient to the Phoenix State was an obligation to be involved in any military conflict which threatened the arrogant empire. But as they traveled through the countryside, they would hear more and more of the atrocities that Goaria had committed against its own people.This was the right thing to do.Their army came in wedge formation. At the very front were mounted archers, mostly of the Acacia Clan, capable of shooting coins at a hundred paces. Just behind them were mounted mages, mostly hailing from the Celadine Clan, trained to launch powerful elemental blasts while maneuvering on animals. In the middle of the wedge were the wielders of earth titans of the Saskatoon Clan, powerful earth mages capable of summoning siege-breaking constructs of stone. As soon as they saw the walls of Medan, they had begun channeling. They were glad they did when they had seen that a great battle had already begun...Their most mysterious forces were the Chaos Falconers of the Ditanny Clan and the Psionic mages of the Sodalite Clan. These warriors were known for their... unique approach to combat. Hiding at the very back of the army, the Falconers would use their large, intelligent falcons to fight. They possessed a spiritual and magical connection with these creatures which allowed them to render the falcons invisible and allow them to plant deadly elemental runes in midair and on the ground. Should these mages run out of mana, the falcons themselves could divebomb a target with the force of a shot gun. The Psionic mages were interspersed among the others. Their abilities allowed them to communicate orders to the other troops, heal, and create minor defensive shields. Their clan was considered pacifist in the extreme, but a few of the younger ones could be goaded into helping for the \"greater good\".All in all, there were about 500 highly skilled specialists.Slowly the cavalry began to advance forward. The chaos falconers would hang back and continue to plant deadly runes in areas where they anticipated enemy forces might strike them, including in midair. The psionic mages began charging their mana to prepare a defensive shield, as their intel had told them to expect some sort of deadly anti-siege weapon, though they weren't sure what kind. Upon seeing the dragons fight, the earth titan corps decided to pool their mana together to summon something... special.***OOC: I'm invoking my 7k NPC count for being a part of the Phoenix State, and declaring war on Goraia for hostile action taken at the borders of Greyhaven.

Dragon attacks of all calibers were taken into account, and there seemed to be certain strategies that maximized survival all across the board, in dealing will all kinds of dragons. It was through this experience that the troops knew not to concentrate forces, particularly missile forces. Scorpion ballistae were also highly mobile, and so Frizlor's breath attack would meet very widely spread out defenders, minimizing the results of any such devastation. The attack left an entire swath of burnt field and some charred bodies who's weapons had been blown to oblivion, though the moisture in the air assured that fire was not likely to spread out of control. The dragon then flew upwards into the sky, where the fog and clouds hung low and visibility was incredibly poor. They kept their weapons trained on the sky, half expecting it not to come back down. If it did, there was only a limited angle at which it could attack again and the troops were ready for it.Feb 27, 2016 20:28:50 GMT -8 Ulfang von Haren said:Ulfang inclines his head as the messenger rides off, and then waits patiently for Dantess to arrive, simply looking at the landscape about him.

but in the end, he was born a commoner, not a noble, and so knighthood seemed far-fetched in Medan.\u00a0 Perhaps the Goraians would have knighted him, but Alastair ditched them before such a possibility came to fruition.He finally regained control of his breathing.\u00a0 Very slowly, he raised himself up and peered over the low stone wall, hidden in the forest.\u00a0 He could see across the expanse of land that rolled between the forest and the Goraian walls.\u00a0 300 yards between his position and the wall.\u00a0 On his order, Alastair's followers would charge across the open field with their ladders, scale the walls, then pull the ladders up and climb down onto the other side.\u00a0 The worst part was that, during the charge, the entire group would be in range of Goraian archers, and if experience told Alastair anything, their footmen and horsemen would not hesitate to ride them down.\u00a0 It was a dangerous task to undertake, but the alternative was imprisonment, and the refugees who were following Alastair decided to risk death over imprisonment.\u00a0 This is gonna be a massacre, the swordsman thought to himself.The field was adjacent to the site of a recent battle.\u00a0 It was here that the Fletchers and Varan of the Black Vale attacked Goraia, and it was here that Dantess Visconti and Ser Avald dueled.\u00a0 Alastair was present at that battle, but did not partake in the fighting.\u00a0 After that conflict, he was sent to New Brimiarde to help put down the resistance - but that's when he had a change of heart and decided to work against the Goraians.For the past few weeks, Alastair did what he could to free as many prisoners as he could, herding them into nearby forests.\u00a0 Not all of them were prisoners, however, as many were also former members of the resistance, or at least supporters of the resistance.\u00a0 These refugees following Alastair were mostly women and children, with about a third of them being men.\u00a0 He had managed to smuggle very few items into the forests as well, mostly shields, which was integral to his plan.\u00a0 The refugees were put to work creating ladders to scale the Goraian walls, much like one would do during a siege.\u00a0 The escapade would need to be quick and responsive, else Alastair and his refugees would be butchered.\u00a0 And this is why Alastair was afraid, because these were mere commoners and peasants - not trained soldiers who followed orders.Alastair crept away from the stone wall and went back into the forest to meet back up with his refugees.\u00a0 Before, they were just small pockets of men, women, and children scattered through the woods and surviving off of scraps, but they had since gathered here in the woods and numbered 500.\u00a0 They were dirty, hungry, and weary.\u00a0 The men were given shields, and most of them women were to carry the make-shift ladders.\u00a0 The men would try to hobble together to form a shield wall, with the women and ladders behind them, and the children behind them.\u00a0 Alastair hoped the visibility of the children might ward off Goraian attacks from the rear.\"No one's forcing you to do this,\" Alastair said solemnly.\u00a0 \"I'm not stopping any of you from turning back.\"\u00a0 Alastair pointed towards the forest's exit, \"But you're freedom is waiting just 300 yards that way.\u00a0 I'm not gonna lie... this is dangerous.\u00a0 And many of us will die.\u00a0 But know that is better to die free than to live as a slave.\"\u00a0 The refugees looked at Alastair somberly, but no one left.\u00a0 \"Then let's go.\"The refugees followed Alastair to the edge of the woods, where they crouched down and prepared to charge.\u00a0 His heart was beating fast, and fear welled up in his throat.\u00a0 He was breathing hard again.\u00a0 But he pushed it all aside, gripped his mangled heater shield, and cried out.\u00a0 \"Charge!\"Alastair's orders would no doubt be heard across the area, and it would no doubt alert the Goraians.\u00a0 A horde of half-dressed, hungry peasants rushed out of the woods.\u00a0 \"Stay together,\" came Alastair's orders again, as the untrained men made a feeble attempt to form a shield wall.\u00a0 \"Stay together!\"\u00a0 The women followed behind with their ladders, probably twelve ladders in total, while the children wailed and cried and tried to keep up.\u00a0 \"Go, go, go!\"Alastair knew it was only a matter of time before the Goraians responded...[/i]", "link_list": ["/user/76"], "image_list": [], "html": "("}, "post-29301": {"user": "Asaph, Dream Hunter", "user_num": 770, "timestamp": "1458406564000", "message": "It had been several weeks since Asaph's battle with Jarkoopi.

It followed a distant order, the echo of which sounded something like \"charge!\"The walls they began rushing to had just reached the final phase of their repairs. A functional stone barrier stood between the masses and their freedom, imposing in stature despite still having its own ladders and scaffolding on the Goraian side, complements from the workers who abandoned their aesthetic finishing touches as an unknown force charged their position.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Archers were present in minimal force following the redeployment of Goraian forces and the general shuffling of of their military buildup. A few gate guards in armor and carrying halberds ran from their positions, quickly positioning themselves to safety against a seemingly overwhelming force of attackers.The truest danger on the field were not archers or gate guards, but the very asset deployed by Goraia at such bottlenecks to specifically respond to the very ordeal they now faced--the mass flight of...well, the masses.Light cavalry mobilized almost immediately, amassing and sallying forth from the now half-built fortress that stood well beyond three hundred yards from the outer parameter. Poised to outrun them down from behind, the cavalry had only to await a simple go-ahead from Goraia's leading brass. Five hundred and-then-some, comprised mainly of civilians, seemed an incredibly easy target, the refugee tactics far exacerbating their dilemma, as such tight congregations as ladder carries and a shield wall formation further exposed them to a full-blown charge that would easily shatter their tight ranks and force most into submission...a charge never came.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Sir?\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dantess' right-hand lieutenant, standing before him, awaited the signal to attack.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dantess looked to the sky, taking in a long, serene breath, exhaling as though savoring the slightly misty air.\"I believe I will make one last executive order before my retirement from the Eastern front,\" he said, now looking to his lieutenant with a smile that suggested he'd made up his mind.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"..Let them go.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>"}, "post-29650": {"user": "Alastair", "user_num": 1218, "timestamp": "1458601332000", "message": "(Asaph, Dream Hunter Lord Tristian Seryl Dantess Visconti)(Note:  I am assuming Dantess' post was the 'end of the turn', so speak, and so I will go ahead and begin the next turn; if there are any problems, please let me know)Alastair, the soldier of fortune, led his rag-tag band of refugees in a seemingly hopeless spree across enemy territory.  A faint order came from Alastair's side, barely audible over the irregular sound of undisciplined charging peasants and their heavy breathing.  \"Ser, it is one of the Seryl's, of House Seryl,\" cried out one of the peasants.\"Enemies?\" asked Alastair.  \"And do not call me ser, I am no knight.\"\"Sorry,\" the peasant quickly replied, \"and no, the Seryl's were executed, but it seems one has survived.  They're allies, if anything.\"Alastair nodded, \"then we do not leave without them,\" he commanded.He then observed the men in the distance.  Goraian cavalry; probably those who rode down survivors at New Brimiarde.  \"Most Holy, help us,\" Alastair struggled to say.  \"Man, who is that there, commanding the defense?\"The peasant knew him as Dantess.  \"It is Dantess Visconti, my friend.  The greatest swordsman in all of Goraia, and probably the entire world.  Should he attack, we are surely doomed!\"Alastair picked up his pace towards the walls.  \"Pray he doesn't,\" he said to the peasant.It took only a little while to actually reach the walls.  The shield wall fell apart and the women quickly came forward and lifted the rigged ladders up onto the sides of the walls.  It looked pitiful and highly unsafe, but there was no other choice.  \"Go, go, go!  Get your arses up there,\" Alastair barked desperately, his voice scratchy from yelling.  \"Seryl's, come with us!\"A few men climbed up to take control of the walls.  If Dantess ordered any soldiers to guard the walls, then the men would engage them (and surely die), while the women and children huddled behind them.  Finally, a good bit of people were on the walls and two of the ladders were brought over to lay down on the other side of the wall.  \"Down, down, down!\"  Alastair sounded like a tyrant as he viciously ordered his refugees down the wall; he damn near threw some of the off as he hurriedly rushed them to the ladders.Those who wore no shoes had bloodied feet and it stained the stone floor of the walls and made the ladders slippery red.  Those who did wear shoes probably wore them out during the charge.  Men, women, and children alike were still climbing up the walls, and others were climbing down on the other side.  \"Run to the hills!  Run for your life!  No one gets left behind, no one!\"But some did get left behind that day.  Exhaustion, stress, and hunger killed at least a dozen of the refugees; their fallen corpses slumped on the walls down below; they never got to see the other side that day.  But nothing could be done for them.  It pained Alastair greatly that he could not do anything for them, and it would strain his heart and emotions for all time.Alastair reached down to help one of the Seryl's finish coming up the ladder.  \"No one else gets left behind,\" Alastair said to the Seryl man as he heaved him up onto the walls.Finally, when everyone who could make it made it, Alastair descended down the ladder and bolted across the fields, in the general direction of the other refugees... they'd regroup later.", "link_list": ["/user/770", "/user/1222", "/user/1110"], "image_list": [], "html": "("}, "post-29659": {"user": "Lord Tristian Seryl", "user_num": 1222, "timestamp": "1458604561000", "message": "Tristian ran as fast as he could in his armor, leading his men.
