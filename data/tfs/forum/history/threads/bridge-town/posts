It should be for all men to be kind and gentle with a woman and treat her with respect. That's what he thought at least, but some didn't share his feelings sadly enough.

On his small look around, he noted the slight glow of green in front of her despite there being no source for that light. And with her eyes being crimson, he would have no idea where that came from.\u00a0After the short climb and her pushing the door open, he was amazing at what he was witnessing. In a place where nothing natural could grow, the room was full of life. Plant life to be exact. He took in a breath and loved the fresh air from the room. A grin spread across his face and he looked around at the various plants.\u00a0\"Amazing! How? This town could grow no natural life here...but how?\"He looked around and saw her looking out the window. When she offered him the seat, he gladly accepted, noting this being a lot more cushioned then what he originally saw. \"I think I figured it out...You did this. You can control plant life? That is amazing!\"He smiling quite a bit and looked around. When she asked, he shook his head. He wasn't very hunger nor thirsty at the current moment.

So what would you like, and what do you have to offer?\"(The Abandoned House - Azrael and Kalarys.)The Fisher King turns his attention on to Kalarys. For the moment he completely ignores Azrael. He rests his cane on the floor in front of him, and leans on it with both hands.\"I want nothing from you Ms. Talin. You were a happy accident, an unexpected gift, to an ultimate end. Yes, I entrap some living mortals in the town for a spell. However, I don't keep them here indefinitely. Usually I mine them for information, then I let them go. Had you actually talked, to the young man I sent to you that first day, you would have been free of this place in a week. However instead you holed up in a house, and did something unexpected. You had a connection, to exactly the kind of being I needed. A Ferry Man! Normally no one can come to this place on purpose. However, thanks to your link, and my assistance, your sweet Azrael made it through the mists. Tragically you were both eminently hostile, with talk of striking me down, and making me pay. Though I am just as eager to get this over with as you are, I decided to leave you to stew. You have been trapped her for a month, for that you have my apologies. Though understand, I have been trapped here for millennium. I suppose it was a petty act, but so be it.\"Azrael was indeed a being of immense power. However, he was grossly overestimating his efficacy in the space between life and death. A sensation of being close to death, was quite normal in Bridge Town. The Fisher Kind didn't even feel the need to block the magic. Finally finished with Kalarys, he turns to the seraphim. The Fisher King laughs a deep, hearty, laugh, full of mirth and contempt.\"More beings with ears that don't listen, eyes that don't see, and brains that don't think. Tell me, are all Ferry Men as presumptuous\u00a0as you? You continue to assume you understand the situation, without making any attempt to learn what it is. My duty, is to prevent the people of this town from killing each other. If a half dead soul becomes\u00a0completely\u00a0dead here, they lose\u00a0corporeal\u00a0form, and what little pleasure there is to have in Bridge Town. Before me there was lawless\u00a0anarchy, souls killing souls over scraps of bread. I\u00a0instituted the barter system, and made them fear me enough to follow it.\"As The Fisher King speaks, his anger and annoyance grows. The\u00a0presumption, arrogance, and zealotry of Azrael has pissed him off.\"You are under the assumption that I am the one keeping people here. The only person I am currently keeping here, is your betrothed; And as I just explained, that could have been resolved weeks ago. This is where Styx and Styx meet, do you understand what that means? It is a nexus of afterlives, where lost and forgotten souls wind up. They can't leave, because there is no one here to guide them. This is neutral territory, no one has a claim, barely anyone knows it exist. You use reaping these souls as a threat? You utter ass. That is exactly what I want! I want what is best for my people, and that would be finally escaping this wretched place. I say again we could have ended this in a day! Except you don't come off as even remotely reasonable. Instead I decided to waste every ones times, to make a point. Just to show you I can be equally unreasonable. Still maybe in the future you should try talking to people, get to know them, understand what is actually happening. Instead of assuming, that just because you are an angel of death you know all, and will get exactly what you want when you want it.
