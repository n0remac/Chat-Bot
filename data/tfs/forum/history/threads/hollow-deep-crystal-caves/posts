Rock gives away to soil, which bears massive trees that have grown to curl with the rounding walls of the hollow; their branches and leaves blocking out the lack of sky one would think lurked beyond them.The cavern would expand, and soon one would forget they had descended into a cavern to find this. Rich, fluorescent-like glows in the lush grass, dancing on the slowly winding rivers like fireflies, and lighting up the \"night sky\" as it were. Casting one's eyes up to see a sky only find a mist to blot out the reality of the cavern roof far overhead. The very \"forest\", standing tall and strong to the canopy overhead, seems alive with color and light, as if pixies were constantly at play. The air tingles the nose when one remains in the area for a prolonged length of time, but there is nothing terrible in the scent. In fact, the flora here occasionally gives off an odd pollen that smells subtly sweet.The truth is not so sweet, as it is the abnormal vegetation and flowers that causes an illness to those that stay for too long. The pollen of a particular white lily is a poison that corrodes the blood in a very slow process. The spores from caps and the like causes an irritation in creatures that inhale it, leading to unprovoked aggression and rage - it can easily stir one into a violent fit. A very potent nightshade also grows here, recognized by the dark, almost purple tint of the leaves - it is known to put one into a hard sleep, but even more so with this breed. Some do not wake upon introducing too much into the body. Ingesting of any of these items doesn't seem to do more than possibly accelerate the infection - they are edible but ill advised considering the effect of just the particles.And it is the denizens trapped here that are struggling to survive against the dangerous flora thriving in the cavern. There are a mix of Fae and Elves that crawl about, some managing to live and some barely able to breathe. Many of the original arrivals many years ago have already passed on, one by one, due to the prolonged exposure to this world below. And there is hardly any hope - monsters forced them to flee and the fear of them lingering in the caves above stop most from trying to leave. All that remains is a dying colony with a mad prince that grieves every one that he has lost, and weeps for his lacking ability to save them...", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1264/deep-crystal-caves"], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/kK73g1h.png"], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"1\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"160\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/DItD349PGN0?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"256\"></iframe><br/></div>"}, "post-33345": {"user": "Takhana Veil", "user_num": 1067, "timestamp": "1460763634000", "message": "It had become Takhana's practice to regularly sweep the continent at various points during the day - not only to work on further extending the range of her scrying abilities, but on the off chance that she might pick up something of interest.

Scrying was a weak ability that he had little practice on and less control over. The clear glass had been clouded several minutes though nothing was becoming visible - not in the orb or in his own mind.

His eyes, wide and frantic, were watching the tunnel with intense focus - he was ready to attack at the first shadow to move. His breathing was heavy and shaking - a mix of his physical exertion with the sprint, and an effect of the prolonged exposure to the flora in this place. A thin sheen of perspiration had already formed on his brow. He was in a maddened condition by this point, muttering ceaselessly to himself in some form of reassurance. \"They won't get in.
