A gift?\u201d\u201cAye, child.\u201d The old woman wheezed out, and then said, \u201cBut may we be seated first?

It was the wisest thing you could have done, because you are not only the last in line for great nobility through your father's blood, but you are one of three young women who are the last in line for this great and ancient bloodline...

She was queen of her people, and her people were vast. She was powerful, but never used her powers for greed or hate, or anything bad. She harnessed her power for the good and fairness of her people.

One would not think to look at it, that it was anything special... But you see, the jewels each represented and was enchanted by one of the four elements... Earth, Air, Fire, and Water. The crown allowed her to control the way the natural environment was. She could control natural disasters, and natural prosperity throughout hundreds of miles, even passed the borders of the land.

Jun was counting on the idea that knowledge of how something works was very different from building it.(To put it simply, it was a catalyst. The scepter served almost like a lightning rod, drawing the magical energies from her body just like a normal staff, wand, or scepter. However, unlike a normal magical weapon, which required the user to focus the energy by using up a hand, this device essentially gave the user a \"helping hand\", drawing magic out of the body by mere concentration and sending it to both hands, where it could be weaved and bent with both hands. This allowed for faster, more accurate spell-casting and the potential for simultaneous spells of different types.Jun's grandmother had a disability where she couldn't control fine amounts of magic and had to draw up massive surges of energy to create anything useful. Such massive amounts of energy were difficult to control and caused great pains in her learning process, even though the results were quite powerful. This contraption, which at first was mocked by Lynx's peers, solved the problem by giving Lynx fine control over otherwise unwieldy amounts of magic. Being forced to learn unusually powerful spells earlier in life, combined with her natural talents, made Lynx the most powerful combat sorceress in her tribe's history, and one of the most powerful in the world... something Jun aspired to one day.)", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Jun grinned. \"Well, long story short it makes it easier for me to use magic.\" She was forcing herself to be cautious.

She would demonstrate the various other creations Jun could fabricate with light. She would demonstrate how by controlling the permeability and density of the construct she could construct a light skiff, a boat made of light that can be used for flight. She would show how by splitting her focus she could create a powerful magical ballista, one part of her mind making the ballista, the other the bolt.

She would explain that this magic should only be used sparingly on oneself. The magic supplements a bodies natural restorative abilities with the mages energy, so healing oneself is far more draining and should not be done during combat. She would show how one could with considerable preparation and use of mind splitting, use light magic to regrow a missing limb though this would have likely left Jun out of mana for over two days.
