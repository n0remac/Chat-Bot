And when tomorrow morning comes, I need you to take this letter to the House of Falling Blossoms Tea House and present it to a man named Omura. You stand out like koi in a crystal pond. He'll know to recognize you, and he'll introduce himself. Arrive alone. Do not bring anyone with you into the establishment.\"<br/><br/>He handed her a letter, sealed with the official seal of the Kiyonai Magistrate.</div></div><div class=\"quote_clear\"></div></div></div>"}, "post-65772": {"user": "The Hizashi Clan", "user_num": 936, "timestamp": "1494220770000", "message": "May 6, 2017 22:38:05 GMT -8  @ketsueki said:Vermin.
