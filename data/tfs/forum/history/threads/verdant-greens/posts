Why they would hoard such a useless goo is up for debate.Oliver's path is a much different beast. A small, simple wooded path that ends with a wispy figure standing and waiting. Taking more than a few steps in its direction spurs a dramatic series of changes that are nearly too quick for the eye to follow, though a dedicated mind would be able to discern the rows of trees flanking the path dropping and sliding out of view as if they didn't need to be affixed in place with heavy, deeply-ingrained root systems. What was once a well-worn footpath beneath Oliver's feet is now little but a mass of grasses, weeds, and the occasional bramble, spread as far as the eye can see, as he stands in a wide, deep patch of forest with sparse tree cover and strong rays of sunlight beating through the canopy above to shine their god-rays on whatever might happen to need a little sunning.Taking the horned woman's place is a hulking monstrosity of a beast, nearly twice as tall and wide as a horse, with a body comprised of thick and unyielding vines plated with fat swaths of tree bark and leaves, shaped and molded into a horned beast that very well may be the unholy marriage of a bull and a daemon. It moves on all fours, taking quick, powerful steps that shake the trees around it, stirring up frightened birds and disturbing the natural tranquility of the forest with little care for its surroundings. Trees it passes are stripped of their bark if it should happen to rub against them, sheared off as if its mock skin were poison to them, and its wide, snouted head follows the ground as if trying to smell out unseen prey.It only raises its head when it can take a good, long look at Oliver, then it turns to the distant and open forest, lumbering to a surprisingly quick run that tears of great clods of earth in its wake.But at least it's leaving tracks.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "With a small fanfare of splintering wood to signal the end of happy fun chat-time, the breach in the path closes as the trees shift and fight one another to form a clean, concise path again; Aside from Sagan's experiment in pyromancy, the trail looks just as it did before, still leading right into the small clearing with the natural raised stone.
