He dragged his pack behind him, leaving a trail in the dirt.  His hand moved involuntarily to his growling stomach.  He swore he heard it echo off the cliff walls.  The swordsman steeled himself, thinking of something to take his mind off the pain.  Images of his childhood home came to mind, and the sound of wooden swords clacking together in his family's private dojo.\tJun's straw hat fell off his head.  It would have been lost to the cliffs, if not for the string keeping it around his neck.  The sun broke through the clouds, warming his face.  The temple basked in the morning light, welcoming the pilgrim into its halls.  He stopped before getting too close, wanting to enjoy the temple's famed view.  Just then, a flock of cranes soared across the sky from below.\t\u201cThey must be taunting me,\u201d he thought. \u201cHow easily they travel, while we struggle to stay on our feet.\u201d \tHe pressed on, approaching a pair of shaven temple acolytes.  Recognizing him as a pilgrim, they assisted him with his belongings and ushered him in as a guest of honor.  The monks prepared a bowl of steaming white rice and three small cups of butter tea for him, in silence.  As etiquette dictated, Junrei drank two cups, and left the third full, never minding that he still felt parched.  He made short work of the rice with a pair of chopsticks.  He was sure to leave a clump of the grains untouched, to show that the meal had been enough.\tThe swordsman was still hungry of course, but at least his stomach stopped growling for now.  After finishing, he rose from his mat and walked to the back of the temple.  A waterfall streamed from the highest point of the cliffs.  Junrei noticed another pilgrim, meditating under the cold water.  In another area, was a small house, a near replica of the temple itself.  Large enough for a few people.\tAn elder monk stood ramrod straight, lording over a student as he meditated in a lotus position on a straw mat.  The elder held a bamboo switch in his arms.  Reminding himself why he took the journey, Junrei approached the house.  The elder gave him the slightest hint of recognition, meaning his presence was not entirely unwelcome.  Junrei took a mat and assumed the meditation position.  He closed his eyes and thought about not thinking.                                                       *  *  *\t\u201cWe're going to die here, aren't we?\u201d  Hikaru said.\t\u201cC'mon, we're the rear guard.  Not much chance getting attacked out here,\u201d Katsu replied.\tJunrei stared straight head, trying to peer through the fog that swirled around the Sea of Trees forest.  Somehow, he found himself fighting for the Tosa clan, in an ill-fated feud with the Aritomo family.  The ring of metal on metal sounded from behind the thick fog.  No way to tell which side was winning, or if any of the other squads were left.  For all the three knew, the Aritomo men were closing around them like a noose.\tJunrei caught the look of disdain from Hikaru.\t\u201cNo armor, slackened grip on your sword, no stance.  It might as well just be us Katsu,\u201d Hikaru said.\t\u201cDo you forget that this is Junrei?  Not some farm boy like us.  The man knows what he's doing.\u201d\tJunrei stared straight ahead, ignoring the chatter.  He controlled his breathing as best he could.\t\u201cJun, let's go.  This damned war's a lost cause,\u201d Hikaru said hopefully.\t\u201cOur commander told us to hold,\u201d Junrei replied.  \u201cSo we hold.\u201d\tHikaru spat on the ground and began to pace.\t\u201cTo hell with this,\u201d Hikaru finally said.  \u201cI have an expecting wife and a rice paddy to tend.  You can die in this gods forsaken place for all I care.\u201d\t\u201cHikaru will you shut up?\u201d Katsu hissed.\tHikaru threw down his sword and turned to walk away.  The twang of a bow sounded from a distance.  An arrow broke through the fog, hitting home in Hikaru's back.  A warband of ten Aritomo foot soldiers emerged from the fog.  One was disheveled and bloodied, with an empty quiver strapped to his back.  The rest ran toward the two-man squad, swords waving over their heads.\tNever taking his eyes off the enemy, Junrei knelt down and picked up Hikaru's sword, assuming one of the Two Heavens stances and backing into a group of closely positioned trees.  Katsu flailed about with his weapon, ripping into a couple of the men, thanks to a mix of sheer luck and tenacity.  The rest bore down on Junrei.  His technique was deceptively lazy, letting the swords work for him as his arms swung gracefully and tactfully.  The enemy thrust their blades with haste and anger, but were blocked by Junrei's calm and calculating maneuvers.\tA parry, a feint, a quick swipe, little by little, he chipped away at the opponents.  Their robes were torn and darkened with blood, made from dozens of Junrei's small but effective cuts.  A battle-crazed warrior ran up to him and attempted a wide swipe, aiming to cut off the swordsman's head.  Junrei shifted to the side, the opposing edge biting into the hard trunk next to Junrei.  With one sword, Junrei severed the enemy's hand.  It still clung to its weapon, lodged into the wood.  In Junrei's other arm, his second sword blocked another strike.\tIn a near fatal error, Junrei allowed himself to look behind him, responding to the sound of hoofs beating the ground.  The cavalry had arrived.  The swordsman turned back to the survivors of the warband, just in time for an enemy's blade to bite into his shoulder.  The only thing that saved his arm from being severed, was the shaft of an arrow loosed from a cavalry man, that killed the enemy swordsman.                                                      *  *  *\tSnap!\tJunrei's eyes opened.  The bamboo switch landed hard on his shoulder.  The elder gave him an admonishing glance, before resuming his thousand mile stare.  Realizing his concentration had been broken, Junrei got up, bowed in apology and left the meditation house.  He found a stone bench to sit on.  When no one was looking, he loosed his robe, and rubbed the scar that ran down his shoulder to the top of his ribs.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Junrei's legs wobbled weakly up the last stretch to the temple.
