He saw the true extent of the woman's terror through her eyes. He knew he had to do something. He had to get the blade away from the woman. Krylancelo saw how quickly the large orc could move. All the captain needed was the opportunity to act. \"I might be able to will the blade away\" he thought. \"However if the blade has any magical properties it would mean the death of the woman.\" Krylancelo shook his head in frustration. He couldn't risk the woman's life on the off chance the blade is mundane. However he had one more option available. It would likely take the extent of his energy. He had never used his ability on such a large being. \"By the heavens this orc is huge\" he thought. Fortunately, this ability shouldn't alert the bandit.

Still cognizant of his surroundings, Krylancelo delved deep into his mind and spirit, searching for any semblance of energy. He just needed to scrape up enough energy to stabilize his wound. He slowly found a trickle of energy within the deepest recesses of his spirit. This energy, was different though. It felt different then his usual mana. It felt almost... older. I will need to pursue this further, but for now this should suffice in stabilizing my wound. Krylancelo gathered this strange mana and imagined his wound closing and the body repairing its damage. Krylancelo stared wide-eyed as this mana manifested itself around his abdomen. Krylancelo's healing magic usually appears as a light blue energy. This time however, it appeared blacker than the darkest night sky, devoid of stars. When the magic faded, Krylancelo cautiously reached towards his wound. Expecting to feel the damaged skin and a sharp pain, he was stunned to feel smooth skin. He looked down, not even a scar remained to tarnish his skin.Krylancelo wearily stood up and slowly approached Gothmog and Faylen. \"Captain, what can I do to help?\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Krylancelo rested at the base of the tree, his gaze fixated on Faylen and Gothmog.
