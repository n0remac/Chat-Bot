Ancient  tongue  upon  a black  card the pad of thumb running across the uneven surface.

The instructions  were clear at  least  to the  one  that  had  read them   and  with that he folded the card into  of the  folds of cloth  which covered his naked form.  Adorned  in only what seemed  bandages, which bound his arms  and  legs completely  preserving  some  form  of  modesty. His torso  was bound   as well and those  white strands  of  cloth were stained in various colors a mixture of  dirt and something else.. and though the fabric appeared  worn  it  was applied with some sense of   care and attention and tied  neatly at either wrist, excess lengths  of fabric  dragging  along the snow covered  ground  as  he  laid  out the package  before  him, slowly  untying  the long  sash  which  had  been  used  to  hold it  in  place before  unrolling  it upon the snow. A simple  white cloak, the fabric  seemed to disappear  upon the canvas of  white, though  it was littered with various objects. Three  small  golden bars  which  sparkled under the star strewn sky. Slowly -- as if  performing  a ritual  the male collects the items and sets them aside  before slipping  the cloak  over his head. Seemingly  unfazed by the cold or the snow which  had accumulated upon his motionless form.  Crystalline breath fell from pale  lips with a slow exhale. And the  male gathered the remaining  objects, a roll of stripped cloth, two small leather pouches, and  a small dagger made from silver. Rowen drew  the small blade and tested  its  weight-- its sharpness-- and though it was highly  crafted the range  at which it would be  effective seemed rather lacking. He was expected to slay the Great Wolf  with  this? Very well. . . The unnamed benefactor was long  gone,  a mission that   most would  consider suicide  given the male's current state. Slowly  the being rose  though not entirely, digits  rummaging through the snow, unearthed  a long lance which glowed  under the pale  lunar glow  which  cast shards  of silver every which way. Pale skin held a faint  bluish  tint  which seemed  to  radiate in that light like a specter he appeared gliding through the surrounding  forest  which the ease  of someone who had lived there all their h lived.

The approaching Rowen, hwoever, broke the trance and the primal instinct of the beast before.  Before Rowen could deliver his ankle-shot, the White Wolf's reflexes kicked in and he sent his leg flying up at alarming speed towards Rowen's chest, in an effort to use his powerful muscles to kick the man away.  At the same time, Ralf the Wolf used one his clawed hand to grab Renner's right wrist, and then used his other hand to deliver a powerful push into the hunter's chest.Hopefully, the Wolf thought, both of his attackers would be sent flying back.  It seemed he was to quick and perceptive for one to fight normally.  However,  the Wolf was not at his zenith either, as he had hesitated.  Something in his mind was preventing him from using his primal fury, and it locked out much of his strength, cunning, and awareness.  He seemed to be at odds with himself.  Something about these two men was... familiar... it lit a spark of familiarity in him that tried pushing his feral instincts away, but he fought it off.  Without the much-needed primal fury, the Wolf would be locked in a drawn-out fight with these two men; he needed to find easier prey, something to sate his bloodlust for now and ward off whatever was trying to overcome his mind; unlocking his inner beast would let him handle these two much easier.\"Arrrooo!\"  The White Wolf scampered away a good distance and let out a feral howl.  He then darted away at blinding speed, into the distant wintry wood.  As he disappeared, the duo of Renner and Rowen heard the growling of wolves behind them...When they looked, they would see a pack of five wild wolves, bearing their sharp teeth and slowly moving to surround the two.  They all had black fur, with bright red eyes contrasting against the snow.  The sun was going down, and the dark forest would only grow darker; nearby, however, was a cave.  It was only a matter of time before the Wolf of White Pine found a lone hunter, or renegade bandit hiding out in the woods and sated his lust for blood...

He wasn't sure what the two men were thinking.  \"Okay, then,\" he said questioningly.  He started to shuffle around and finally removed his chest armor.  Sure enough, there on his left breast, was a large blue and black bruise.  \"Uh oh,\" he said frighteningly, before quickly pulling off the armor on his right shoulder.  A wound; or so it seemed; something had hit him there.  Renner's arrow.  \"Oh no,\" Ralf realized what was wrong, or he at least thought so.  \"Oh, by the Gods, no!\"Ralf stood up and was breathing hard.  \"Wounds inflicted upon the werebeast must affect me as well!
