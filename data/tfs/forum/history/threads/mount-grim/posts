Or in this case bit... It was a lesson that Alan normally danced around, but his attempt to shadow away had backed him into a bit of a corner. Lucky for him he wasn't the only one not taking things seriously. The diamond blade by way of it's enchantments was strong enough, and Alan himself just barely fast enough.So as the claw came down Alan threw himself to the side, catching the blow with the side of his sword, one hand on the flat of the blade near the tip and the other at the hilt. Naturally this didn't go down particularly well as he'd thrown himself into the air to try and get out, and then caught a swipe from a dragon on magic roids. Pain flourished as his wings were pressed into the rocks of the cave wall, and then into his back, the bones groaned until the odd angles of the rocks in the cave became too much and the bone in his left wing snapped with a sound like thunder, at least in his own ears, although it may very well have been audible. His leather armor had small tears in a few places but overall his skin was okay.His Warriors training had him back on his feet as soon as he stopped moving, distancing himself from the dragon, but being careful not to back himself into a wall again. He stopped for a second taking a deep breath and then spitting out a wad of blood which was gurgling in his lungs. The force of the hit had done some internal damage, but unlike the wing it was already healing, stemming blood loss. He had to force his body to not attempt to heal the wing, it needed proper treatment to heal in a usable way. Grimacing with pain but keeping his eyes on the dragon he folded his wings back into their seal.Without his wings he didn't think he could escape from the dragon in the open, so instead he secured his hold on the shadows, they were now thickening very noticeably, soon they would be useful to him.That is when Alan noticed something very, very odd. The young women he had been attempting to save charged the dragon with impressive speed. He'd been planning to play it safe while building up power, but it appears she had other ideas. Spitting more blood he'd charge back in, only slightly slower for the damage he'd taken, he was a warrior after all, pain was a well known companion. He'd attempt to wait for the dragon to react to Kelly, and if it opened it's maw he'd attempt to stick his great sword in up through the spongy flesh. If it didn't attempt to eat the women or something else which caused it to open up, he'd instead attempt to use the distraction to get a shot into one of the beasts eyes.

She felt herself grow a little colder, her hair a little less red but her eyes flashed like lightning bolts even more furiously.

Not that she needed it, her mind was hers and hers alone.Blue static charged up her arms and down her legs, she created chains of bright azul\u00a0to counter the dark beings own black ones and stood firm ready to react to any move, she could also feel a\u00a0third presence in her mind and she soon realised\u00a0it was Trogdor , all these years this evil being had its tendrils wrapped into his mind and Eli knew that moment she would expel this evil just like she had the last one who tried to threaten her and others she cared about, despite helping Kelly attack the dragon she cared for all living things. She called out to him, knowing it was a big leap of faith for both of them but to completely\u00a0expel\u00a0it from each other's mind she would need his help otherwise it would just retreat back into the dragon's mind.
