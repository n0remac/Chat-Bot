The voices were kept in rhythm by thick, meaty slaps, as if the beings were slapping their chests instead of clapping their hands.When their routine had ended, there were several girlish claps and hoots and hollers.The final routine was a combination of male and female voices. A young woman would seem to lead the chant with an ordered, carefully sung oration. Like clockwork, male voices joined in. A few of the males did not sing per se, but cried out with their sadistic sounding roars which could scare away tigers, somehow complimenting the rest of the chorus. Indeed, more flocks of birds fled from the ominous, yet beautiful song.When the third routine was over, the jungle was filled with cheers and laughs.
