Her head tilted back to take in the full height of the gate, a smile touching her lips. This place was vastly different from the crudeness of the buildings in her homeland, flowing better with the world and seeming to merge with nature as it was meant to, perhaps.Her feet carried her further into the abandoned compound. She could hear nothing but the birds chirping and other, noisy forest creatures. It was rather peaceful as she advanced toward the facade of one edifice. If she hadn't already been on a mission to search for the floating island, she would have gladly settled in this place, that much was certain.All the walking was growing tiresome.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Ianna spent the night, resting peacefully beneath a tree.
