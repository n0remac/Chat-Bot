Not so much for the others, but she was none too happy about traversing the caves either.Someone new entered the scene, and, of course, there were the fae creatures following her too until she introduced herself... Then they all collectively flit away. \"Welcome, please sit and eat. We'll collect dried food supplies after we are done, and then we shall go.\"The breakfast was not brief, but it was pretty quiet and solemn. After they all ate, the villagers cleared away everything and took the remainder for the people. Feruzia then had everyone grab ration bags. Her hawk was left to sit in the rafters, flying in a cave wouldn't do. He would fly the trek from the outside. The wolf did come.She led everyone to the dungeon, lit already by blazing torches. At the end of one corridorm she took the last torch, then pressed a notch in the wall. The damp smell was strong, and a cold blast of air could be felt. She went in first, and as soon as the party was all in the first part of the cave, a villager held a finger over the notch. Feruzia said, \"Leave now if you feel you cannot do this, because there is no way to open that door again from this side.\" ", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Everyone was directed to eat. As Kylie commented on the trust, Feruzia stirred at the porridge and said, \"The fae let you in because of Camilla and were curious to know why things have been horrendous.
