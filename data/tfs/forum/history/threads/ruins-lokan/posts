He then retrieves the body, a difficult task from within the hole, and lowers it gently, to lie at the bottom. \"I'm so sorry.\"Alden says to the body, his voice horse and dry. He climbs out of the hole and begins shoveling dirt, making it a grave. Three days, eighteen graves. All in a line on the outskirts of what was once Lo'Kan.

Her steps were light and airy, and she wore a demure, peaceful grin. Her eyes glistened and her cheeks were red. No matter how many times she did this, she just couldn\u2019t get used to being the center of attention. But the relief of bringing joy into other people\u2019s hearts was immeasurable.It was the joy she felt for living in a constant state of redemption.Now that she was at the center, she took the time to gauge the emotional state of the audience.  She had her eyes on Alden and Wither. She couldn\u2019t read their minds, but she sensed their souls. They were in pain. They were missing a certain truth. Indreni smiled. She hoped her performance would help reveal truth to them. And if not, hey, there was always tomorrow and the day after that.***The music that accompanied accompanied her entrance started off with a soft, delicate guitar. Then a thin, feminine humming voice appeared. The voice would seem to come from all around. Then a percussion would appear. The percussion would start to intensify along with the invisible woman's voice, which began to sing words in an alien language.If Alden looked to her sides, he would start to see the supposed source of the percussion. They faded in quite subtly. Indreni was being flanked by four statuesque angelic figures. They were clearly not living beings however. Instead they were made of a solid blue, unknown material. They were striking drums made of the exact same material. What made their strikes odd was how how their entire upper bodies swung down with the strikes, their heads nodding violently with each thump. Their eyes appeared closed shut, as if in a trance. It was as if they lived to do nothing more than play this particular beat (which Alden might realize was technically the case).As this bit of the song hit a crescendo, the intensity of the glass-like beings increased until the very end, at which point they were practically blinding.Then they disappeared.***At this point a large, star-like structure, a little like a burdock seed pod, appeared in the air. It was a bright white and seemed to be made of some kind of gemstone. When the structure appeared, the music changed. It became much more upbeat, like how a Spanish guitar might accompany a violent tango or duel. This time the music did not have a visible source.The construct darted around, coming within inches of the faces of the audience members (including Alden). It was bright, energetic, and pure.But then several smaller lights came. These had a smaller, more playful quality to them. They shimmered in multiple colors and didn't have as much gravitas as the main light. They orbited around the larger structure, each with its own path. Some were very straight and predictable and some darted around erratically. It would be highly reminiscent of a solar system or a chaotic diagram of an atom. As the \"personalities\" of the colors became more clear, occasionally the larger white structure would shrink down and give way to the other structures, which would increase in size. The colored structures would be revealed to not only have their own behaviors, but their own textures. Some were spiked, some were smooth, and some were bumpy. Some even had strange tendrils and handles and some were totally inconsistent, warping and mutating violently to the music.But ultimately the structures all seemed to have a harmonious relationship...That was, until this part of the song too reached a crescendo before suddenly pausing ominously, ending with a loud gong.Then came a violent surge of percussion, a terrified and panicked piano, and several other strange instruments which to Alden's knowledge weren't even supposed to exist. At this, the white construct began to surge around violently, not allowing the other lights to keep up. To the audience's horror, the large light would suddenly crash into one of the smaller lights, shattering it into sparkles.This pattern continued. One by one the smaller lights were violently eliminated, their rainbow of sparkles littering the entire \"battlefield\" like blood. The once pristine bright white light would start to turn pink, then red, then a deep purple with each \"kill\". Finally there would be nothing but the center light and thousands of sparkles floating through the air, in dozens of different colors. Once again the music came to a crescendo and then ceased.***A new song began. This one was a pure soft piano, mournful and lamenting. Soon it was joined by a feminine voice singing in an unknown language. The purple light slowly rose higher into the air, and the rainbow of sparkles began to dissipate.An assertive, frantic violin began to play, and then more percussion returned, as the light was suddenly surrounded by a hailstorm of yellow lights. There were thousands, each seemingly corresponding to an individual sparkle from before. The voice oddly remained perfectly consistent, just as sorrowful as before, with not an edge of aggression. The lights rapidly rotated around the large purple light as it tried to get away.The singing eventually stopped, and the introduction of more percussion and an incredibly fast paced piano solo revealed a new presence among the lights. Light constructs, all yellow, mirroring the appearance of the friendly colored gems from before, shined brightly and surrounded the purple light. The purple light was technically larger, but the luminosity of the other lights easily overwhelmed it.These too began to haunt the purple light, until the song ended.***There was a very brief, but powerful solo by the angelic voice, which was interrupted by more music. It was obvious a rapid crescendo was approaching via the interplay of the other instruments. When it came, the audience would be overwhelmed by singing and instruments all around accompanied by a rapid, energetic voice. It would the sort of thing one would work out to; it was far too emotional for dance music.The solar system of light constructs had suddenly all gone bright red and were spinning rapidly around the entire arena. They spun so rapidly they were practically in disk form, once again coming within inches of people's faces. This went on for who knows how long (no more than a few seconds, but it was very easy to lose track of time during Indreni's legendary performances) before this song too came to a close. The system was no less vibrant, but it has stopped moving.***The final performance would be the one Indreni hoped reached Alden. The music was very different this time. Instead of angelic choruses or pianos, there was a metallic sort of duet, in the sense that the voice would seem to echo itself, forming its own harmony. It was accompanied by a stranger instrument, like an electric guitar (not that those existed in this world, but that's what Alden would hear). But one thing the alien language was able to convey was hope, something which none of the other songs hand.The red solar system would shrink down until it only accompanied a fraction of the arena, before the music would turn violently enthusiastic. When this happened, more light construct solar systems would appear, one for each of the original colored gems of before. Each one matched the original color scheme, and the texture of the center of each system was identical to its corresponding \"ancestor\". The lights frantically dances around the red light, forming a chorus of systems.The music actually had turned into something one could dance to.As the song progressed and the ballet of light constructs became more frantic, Alden would notice the entire performance would begin to change colors. At first each individual system would slowly fade from one color to the next, and then the individual constructs in each system, and then the various curves and edges of the constructs, all flowing and bleeding together in an overwhelming shower of color.The deafening and blinding display only increased in power. The patterns that the lights followed also increased in variety. It was reaching the point where the constructs no longer existed in recognizable systems, but rather began to exchange structures.It was a great big beautiful mess; dozens of sounds, textures, and colors in thousands (if not tens of thousands) of permutations were represented in this performance.And the music was clearly going to end in happy, upbeat note.Which it did, but not before one last reveal. The final chorus was marked by several angelic beings, made of the same \"stuff\" as the initial drummers, but emanating a violent multi-chromatic mix rather than the solid blue, fading into existence around the dance of constructs. It would be implied that these beings, whatever their were, were doing the singing and playing of instruments.As soon as the song ended, everything disappeared in a sudden rush of wind.***And with that the lights went back up, and Indreni took a bow.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<font face=\"times new roman\">As the lights dimmed, the middle aged woman took her place in the middle of the stage.

He didn't feel right, he felt lost and confused. His certainty of purpose, and his decision to deny that purpose, had left him.
