Swaney had equipped and loaded a crossbow; his first shot would be the signal.The man who rode at the front of this column was Volquin.  Volquin was a knight in every sense of the word.  He was tall, well-built, capable, and had a good heart.  He was also brave and courageous, unerring in his devotion to the cause he served.  A good man if there ever was one.  His warhorse was white, and where the hair was missing it was obvious the horse may have suffered some wounds in the past.  Volquin wore chainmail and a white surcoat, upon which was a black and gold cross.  His steel sword and heater shield bumped up and down against the horses saddle, while a massive zweihander hung down the knight's back.Behind Volquin rode a dozen other knights, similarly dressed and equipped.  Behind them was a force of spearmen, dressed like the guards from Hurst except wearing white surcoats with similar emblems as the knights.\"Not long now, lads,\" Volquin called to his men casually.  He spoke loud enough so Grandma and Urist Ranulfin would definitely be able to hear them.  Swaney's men itched with great anticipation, ready to slay their targets.One knight spoke up, \"maybe quieten down, Brother, might stir up more of the dead bastards.\"Volquin chuckled, \"I say let them come.  The more we put down, the less the Solisians in Hurst have to worry.  Only reason we're headin' back now, and not stayin', is cause I need to use the latrine ditches.  Can't do that fighitn' out here.\"The same knight responded.  \"The Solisians do not trust us, Brother,\" he said cautiously.  The less time we spend with them, the better.  Just my opinion.\"The knights continued to chatter on the dark road until they finally came upon the ambush.  The hidden guards could feel the adrenaline pumping into their bodies, and each one had enough anxiety to just shout loud enough that it would crack the very sky.  They waited and waited... until finally Volquin and his force was in Swaney's crosshairs.Shwoosh!  Swaney's well-placed shot found itself lodged into Volquin's chest.  Fortunately, it didn't hit the heart, but it did startle the knight and flung him off the steed.  \"Oof!\"  Pain erupted throughout the knight's body, and the rest of the knights quickly surrounded their fallen commander.  The spearmen, less disciplined, were panicked but did manage to form a schiltrom.Swaney's men roared and jumped from their hiding places on their surprised targets.  \"Kill'em all,\" Swaney yelled, loading another crossbow.  An intense melee ensued between the two sides.  Volquin's pikemen were being cut down; they had been fighting all day and could not stand to fight any longer.  The knight's faired better, cutting down the assailants and keeping Volquin safe - who was slowly rising to his feet, using his zweihander as a sort of cane.  The bolt pierced his skin and injured him, but he would fight nonetheless.Grand and Urist had to make a choice now.  Did they trust Swaney?  Was Volquin and his men undead in disguise?

The captured spearmen who were serving Volquin, as well as the injured ones, would be tended too by the armed warrior-monks.Limping over to Grandma and Urist, Volquin aimed his sword at the lone guard-captain.  \"Bind him!

They no longer want us to remain, and so we should leave these lands.

So long as we remain and stem the tide of this darkness, it will never get out of control, so we can't exactly leave.\"\"Sir,\" one of the Knights interrupted, \"Hurst is unguarded.

He would answer Urist's previous question now.  \"These Solisians came north in an effort to colonize these lands, which had once belonged to another kingdom; that kingdom was destroyed decades ago by an undead horde.  At first the Solisians met little difficulty here, but then the undead showed up.  Knowing that the Brotherhood had experience fighting dark creatures, the Solisian King hired us to clear out the dead.  We did our job, and we did it well, but then the Solisian settles flocked to our forts rather than their own lords and princes.  Soon enough the Solisians accused us of trying to annex these lands and establish our own kingdom, which was false.  I suspect they were hiring adventurers - like you - to wipe us out.  It doesn't matter now.  We're leaving, and I'm getting the boys back together.  Someone must stem the tide of darkness, and in this age it shall be the Brothers.\"\"I appreciate the help,\" Volquin began to finish.  \"You may take your leave, my friends.  The Brothers swear oaths of poverty, and the Solisian King never paid us for our services, so we do not have much coin.  However, feel free to take what you need from the battlefield and from our armories.\"  Volquin nodded and, if there was nothing else to be said, took his leave and began to help with the clean-up.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"Goraian soldiers?\" Volquin looked confused.  \"Not sure why they'd be meddlin' in all this.\"  After a few short moments of some consideration the Brother shook his head and started to speak again.  \"Don't you two worry about, yet.
