Cut into solid rock this ancient and abandoned shrine used to\u00a0 be a place for worshipping The Queen Of The Divide - a goddess that few in Tawakoshi remember anymore, and those who do warn travelers from approaching the shrine.\u00a0Though her monks have long since disbanded from her service, the place is said to still be inhabited. The story around the locals go, that inside the Theatre of Dust the spirits are once again allowed to take human form and will enact a play to draw you into their service and leave your body to add to the large amount of dust and ash already present. Whispers among travelers claiming to have lived through the play report differently though.\u00a0A feeling of enlightenment, new knowledge and even leaving with valuable and rare items from the other side may be the gift of the spirits. Dare you enter through the stone door, you will find that the place is small and sparsely decorated with a thin layer of untouched grey ash everywhere. After making it through a short but cramped tunnel, one finds that the main chamber holds a small amphitheatre with three rows, pillars on each side of the room framing the scene and a few lanterns that look like they haven't been used for centuries. Dare you sit and watch?[Please don't post here yet]", "link_list": ["https://flic.kr/p/21SEC7e", "https://flic.kr/p/21SECiB"], "image_list": ["https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4693/38642053065_1b03aca48f_b.jpg", "https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4691/38642053725_f91aea439a_k.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/21SEC7e\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4693/38642053065_1b03aca48f_b.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/></a></div>"}}
