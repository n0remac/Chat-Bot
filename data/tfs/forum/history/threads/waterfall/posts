The thought that she would willingly bare everything out for him - a Demonic entity, left him with a confusion beyond simple words. She had dumb-founded him, and perhaps for the first time, he did not react negatively to not being able to comprehend it all. He could sense the difference in their passion as she struggles to love him, and it gently twists into his side. He knows that he probably won't be able to provide what she yearns from him. He has never thought himself capable of expressing love toward anything, and his callous heart had never once been provoked to even bother and try.<br/><br/> Yet, his heart races within this moment, clutching her gently as they settle upon the smoothed rock surface beneath a waterfall. Other demons and those he's come across on his travels were bound to outcry in protest, and it was possible that their crushing judgement and malicious intent could derail what-ever trail Samael not tread upon uncertainly. He was left momentarily exposed to this new potential road, and it only took but a bit of effort from those with darkness in their hearts to lead him back to it. He was venturing into the unknown, and a part of his being didn't want to tread down it either.<br/><br/> Yet...here he remained, a hand resting upon -his- Angel's features, running a thumb along the surface of her features. He studies her intently, as if she was a beautiful painting that would be ruined soon. His eyes portray a deep sorrow, bottoming out into an abyss of numbness. It struck him odd how he felt as if he was lacking in this moment - because he was positive that this meant the world to Naenia. It should have felt the same way for him, and yet...nothingness. It was with this realization that he finds himself hesitant to continue down this path with her. He was not only concerned about himself for once, but how it'd impact the Watcher of Souls.<br/><br/><font color=\"#a51313\"> \"...You're a fool. A weak creature being led on by their own self-destructive nature. Just run away from me, already. Don't you see what's within me, Naenia? I don't know how to....do this. To be emotional like this, and share feelings with you on a scale I can't comprehend. I don't know what love -is- and you're a fool for entrusting me with you heart. I can't create anything, I simply destroy it.\"</font> He whispers, a burdensome weight resting upon his shoulders. Even as he says this, he feels an impending sense of loss. For how long has he gone like this, completely unaware that he may have been lacking? <br/></br></font>"}, "post-30960": {"user": "Naenia the Watcher", "user_num": 1058, "timestamp": "1459378762000", "message": "The contrast of hot demon before her and cool stone against her back made Naenia shudder slightly, but she made no sign or sound of protest; she simply huddled closer to him, basking in the warmth of his body.

He's notably down-trodden, and to his horror, and shock, a singular tear had rolled down his features. It was searing hot, yet it was quickly discarded as he attempted to flee this area.

He leans down and plants a gentle kiss on her brow. Knowledge flows into her then. She understands earth magic in a way she never has before. Resolve seems to well up from within in her as new understanding of diligence enters her mind. Then Spero straightens, his wings unfurling, his silver armor materializing on him. He grins at her and his voice returns to normal.\"You should always have hope child. Even in the darkness there is a light. You impressed me. Though some may disagree with my reason for finding what you did impressive. Still, I truly believe what you did shows more dedication to understanding our ways than any angel has shown in a long time. So I put in a word for you.
