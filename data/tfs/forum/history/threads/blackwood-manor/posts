His eyes rested on the swerving trees outside his windows and on the bustling servants that kept his property in good shape. His hands were shaking lightly, the cutlery harder to steer as a result. He narrowed his eyes, the bushy eyebrows nearly cutting off his vision.\u00a0\"Bloody wallaper\" he muttered as he chewed\u00a0aggressively\u00a0on the egg. His statement was aimed towards the young man cutting his grass, a task which Alister had just now deemed him unworthy of. The elderly man got up from his chair, and then ensued a walk to the window. He flipped a tiny latch and swung the window open.\u00a0\"Ye nugget!\u00a0Have you no regard for me property?\" He roared, his voice harsh and commanding.\u00a0The young man looked up, shielding his eyes with his palm as the sun almost blinded him. \"Terribly sorry sir!\" He mouthed back, waiving his hand in an apologetic manner.\u00a0\"Don't let it happen again you bumbling shitehawk!\" \u00a0Alister spoke, only to shut the window immediately after. He sat down, fuming with anger. In his later years the small things had started getting to him. His hands were now shaking quite strongly, and this made him give up on the scotch egg, instead he reached for his drink and poured it down with\u00a0undisputed\u00a0resolve.\u00a0He rose from his chair, turning to exit his study, for he had to pinch of a loaf, a tradition that stood the test of time. Every morning at nine he visited the loo and put fellow users of said loo to absolute shame.
