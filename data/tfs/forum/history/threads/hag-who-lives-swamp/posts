For as long as any of them could remember, she had occupied that swamp. None knew for sure what she did, or where she came from, but one thing was certain: whenever something as innocent as a farmer's cow falling ill or as grave as the untimely death of an unwed mother occurred, the townspeople would point to the bog. the sickening sight of her crooked features was a rare one, but always a presage of strange happenings. While some had accepted her presence, sometimes bearing gifts and offerings to the wetlands in the hope of appeasing the mysterious hag and perhaps gaining her favors, others grew more and more determined to find out what was truly happening in the depths of the foul bog.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["", "", "http://img09.deviantart.net/11e3/i/2014/173/f/6/swamp_witch_s_hut_by_sweetbeast413-d7nix0f.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}}
