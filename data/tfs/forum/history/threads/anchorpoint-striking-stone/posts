A disturbance formed in the air above the edge of a woodland, unknown to all but those most highly attuned to the natural elements. The disturbance lasted but a few seconds, and from it issued a brilliant bolt of lightning, cracking the sky with a thunderous boom that echoed for miles in the clear weather. At the point of impact, centered in the scorched earth of the strike zone, sat a curiously etched stone carrying markings in a strange language. The rock itself was marbled with a vibrant green crystal vein that swirled and twisted across the surface, pulsing with a light seemingly emanating from within the heart of the stone. So it sat, it's faint radiance pulsing as it sat undisturbed following the event. For those that approach it, they would feel their fine hairs rise and skin tingle and with time they would begin to numb; for those with a sensitivity for it, they would sense an energy radiating from the stone that matched the ferocity of a terrible lightning storm. To all, it's clear that this stone is not of this world.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/7cMsBhL.jpg"], "html": "<i><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/7cMsBhL.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/><br><br/></br></i>"}, "post-46508": {"user": "Lysander Dreighan", "user_num": 1768, "timestamp": "1471297253000", "message": "With no warning or build up, a flash of green light erupts from the face of the stone as a modest travel pack flies out of the face of the stone and clatters to the ground beyond.

Soon after the hands found their purchase, a head emerges from the face of the stone next, bathed in green light as the figure drags himself through the face of the stone into the new world. A man in silvered armour, a large sword slung to his back, a long and thin chain lash looped at his side, slides out of the stone the rest of a way with a slight hop and stands straight, smoothing out any hair that had fallen out of place during his arrival. Taking a moment to look around at his surroundings with an appreciative nod, he looks down at his pack and grabs it in his right hand, lifting it to his shoulder. \"Seems a good enough place as any,\" he speaks aloud to himself, \"I just hope I'm not out in the middle of nowhere this time...\" With another moment to orient himself, the man departs the area heading in the direction he believes to be east.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "With no warning or build up, a flash of green light erupts from the face of the stone as a modest travel pack flies out of the face of the stone and clatters to the ground beyond.

He began to accumulate magical energy again, within his body this time instead of diverting it into his blade. The field that surrounded him would sustain itself for some time before dissipating, and while he was still retaining the means to strike out at a physical assault, the lack of activity spoke to him of a diversion tactic to cause him to lower his guard for a surprise attack, against which he was readying himself.Should an attack come, Lysander would discharge his magical reserves as an arc of stunning lightning to match it, then follow up with his blade to catch his foe before they could recover.
