Stretching from the lands of today's Sanctum Imperium of Ivelius, through the fertile plains and valleys, to its mineral rich lakes and mountains, to what is currently known as The World's Scar, a massive gorge whose depths have yet to be explored. Though such a time was long before the Cataclysm. This event created The World's Scar and subsequently devastated all surrounding lands in the deep south. Turning the empire into an unrecognizable landscape.Fareen was hit with devastation, disease and drought for years after, costing the ruling family most of its authority over the lands, which today is superficial at best. The lands can still be considered fertile, but bandit bands of varying sizes and organization run through the land, Ivelius conducts constant inquisitions to try and claim parts of the landscape for itself, only to be turned back by some of the larger hordes of thugs banding together to keep what is theirs. These are only the dangers that are known to be true in the Fareen Farmlands, other dangers consist of rumors of nightmarish creatures raiding the areas around The World's Scar and spreading out each year. Another such rumor places cults and demonic summoners as responsible for some of the horrors that can be found. Will you adventurers be able to survive in this land of abundant fear, death, and horror?
