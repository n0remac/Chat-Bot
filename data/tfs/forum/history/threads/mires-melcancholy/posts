A dark sinister presence that would change the desolate land even more then it's already has. As the sun sank, a new moon rose.

All that would or could ever be seen would be his blood red eyes. He walked forward, examining the area around him. A lone chuckle could be heard resonating from him. A toothy smirk, one of a stark, almost ghastly white color, spread a crossed the shadow area where his face should be. \"This world will soon know what true fear and despair will feel like. And I will be the one to cause it. And this, will be my kingdom.\"He called out to the world, it echoed off the land.

As the main shadow shot up, a few more followed after it. He smirked a bit as the last spire finished solidifying. He sank back into the ground and a shadow shot at it. It stopped just as it got to the door of his grand castle. He grabbed the hand and pulled it open. He stepped through the door and down the halls. His feet making no noise as he walked to his throne. Once there, he sat on his throne and smirked. Though that didn't last long. He soon grew bored of sitting there and got up. He wanted blood. He got up before sinking into the ground again.
