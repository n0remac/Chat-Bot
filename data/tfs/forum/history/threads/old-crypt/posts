He even doubted if Ignatius' artifacts would be enough to subdue her will. As he looked around the dark catacombs, he contemplated why he had fallen in love with her in the first place.There was a lot of dark activity, mostly due to Jarad's exertions. Spirits and souls and jittering skeletons to accompany the frightened spiders and giant rats. He had no qualms over harvesting their blood and souls for future use... although once again he was haunted by Lynx's morals. Why didn't they see eye to eye on that fateful day? Lynx was a master at using blood as a power source for sacrifices and dark spells, and yet she never took lives to accomplish said goals.

It was Lynx. \"Master, please, let me save them.\"Itzal paused. Suddenly his mind was plagued by thoughts and flashbacks. Part of his domination over Lynx's mind resulted in them having a telepathic link. It was meant to communicate and give orders, but it seemed to be malfunctioning. It wasn't the first time either. During the battle between Lynx and Croeria, the two combats were able to share each others' thoughts and experiences, especially at the end. Itzal actually felt embarrassment, for he thought the magic would be easier to control. But the minds of the people he'd selected weren't ordinary minds.\"Please, master, I can save them!\" There it was again. Itzal groaned in aggravation. He was still holding the journal, the ones the adventurers were most likely requiring. His alien form prepared to travel through the void to appear by Lynx's side and silence her foolishness. But then his mind was once again bombarded by her thoughts...We were so young... so naive... That grove... where we used to play... where we first made love... the birds that sang... it was right next to the tower... Itzal... Itzal... I love you... I wanna be with you forever... Remember those words? Remember what you used to look like? Remember you human form? Remember your beating heart? You loved me too... You wanted to be with me forever... Why Itzal? Why?Please... let me save them... You were a hero once too...Itzal snarled. \"ACCURSED WRETCH!\" But at the same time he could see Lynx's youthful face, those haunted eyes mired in depression and loneliness and yet still shining with hope and feeling, that perfect face that he had fallen in love with, the one he chose to resurrect in her physical prime.Itzal would then appear in front of Harlen Sinclair and his party, passing through the void of space-time more skillfully than even Lynx or Jun were capable of. The tall, gaunt, dark, faceless form would peer spitefully at Harlen, Arella, and Silas with his glowing red eyes. His long fingers would throw all the items of interest, including the journal, at Harlen's feet.\"Flee from this place or I shall kill you all where you stand.\" It wasn't the usual playful voice Itzal normally used to stalk and taunt his prey. It was a cold, demonic, guttural command which came from within the receiving party's very own heart. It had to, since Itzal had no visible facial features aside from his unnatural eyes. As a show of force, Itzal turned towards the wall that Harlen had earlier contemplated hiding behind, particularly the far end, to avoid harming the party. He flicked his wrist at the wall. A psionic shockwave rushed from his fingers. It was invisible to the naked eye and barely seemed to touch the air. In fact some of the wave would have passed harmlessly through some members of the party. But the moment it hit the far end of the wall, the stone splintered into thousands of pieces and flew off in all directions. The sound of shattering stone cracked through the air, following by a sharp, high pitched howl of displaced wind which would have deafened anyone close to the blast.In the next motion Itzal's form inched closer to Harlen's face, which would have made no sense to Harlen as he would not have seen Itzal actually walk towards them. He would just be there, instantly, his mannequin-like face right in front of Harlen's, his glowing eyes causing a glare. \"FLEE! AND TAKE YOUR TRINKETS WITH YOU!\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Itzal's body shook and shuddered.

Both her body and her magical abilities were in their prime, her body from when she was in her late 20s, and her magical knowledge and mana levels retained from her old age. She was wearing mostly black, trousers and a tight-fitting shirt, as well as pieces of black leather armor. If anyone from Harlen's party had the heart to observe the scene, they would also notice something familiar about Cel's primary weapon, a scepter strapped to her lower back with chains running to gauntlets attached to her arms. The scepter's crown possessed a gem which glowed furiously in a multichromatic light, like a solid, physical rainbow.Cel also possessed a bandolier with scrolls laid over her chest...Her solid black hair whirled and flapped violently against the sudden wind that emanated from the crypt. Cel glared defiantly at the entrance, the spirits and dark soldiers in full view. \"You'll have to get past me first you bastards!\" She raised both her arms up and then flared them out angrily to the sides. \"Chaos Art: Transphasic Siege Wall!\" The ground just behind her cracked and shook violently. In an instant a transparent, dark purple mass, like a large sheet of paper, shot up into the sky, forming a barrier between the crypt and New Brimiarde, with Itzal and Harlen's party safely on the other side. The mass extended not only into the air and the ground, blocking the tunnels, but into the reaches of space time. It was multidimensional and could not be traversed by anything too close to this plane of existence, including wandering souls. It would almost look like a god was trying to slice off a piece of the land into the ocean.Cel then pulled out one of her scrolls and slammed it against the wall. The paper possessed a large glyph in an unknown language that gave off an electrical sounding hiss. A network of arcane glyphs sprang up and out of it like a spiderweb, escaping the confines of the paper and traveling throughout the wall in the form of bright glowing symbols. A few seconds later the wall shook with a sound quite like a mace beating against a metal shield.Cel's eyes glowed a sky blue, although it was not an overwhelming, glaring glow like Itzal. The lights were dull but prominent, icy cold. The chains dangling from her arms were now crackling with sparks and bolts and rattled violently. \"Let's go Jarad!\"Itzal, for his part, felt a strong lurch in his stomach. He had no intention of interfering as he had no concern for the fate of New Brimiarde, but there was something lasciviously appetizing about seeing his lover in combat.

Jarad could enter spectral form and his ghosts and spirits couldn't actually be killed. Her barrier would also only last as long as she was present. Even her energy scroll wouldn't keep it there forever.

A fight was about to erupt, danger was everywhere, lives were on the line and a great magical battle was sure to erupt out of it all. Atheas smiled. He was in his element.\"Necromancer! You've interrupted my travels and spooked my horse with your rituals, not that the damned beast would ever admit it. My horses pride aside, I'm of a mind to put a stop to the goings on out here, and I'm sure a good number of people would agree with me,\" Atheas motioned towards the motley assortment of adventurers, along with the faceless man and his pet witch. \"So how about we all have a good sit down around a fire and work out our grievances. Otherwise, I'll have to take some sort of action. Don't make the mistake of taking my attempts at camaraderie for weakness. I've been on the road for some time, it's been a good number of days since I've had a chance to release all the energy building up inside me and you seem as good an outlet for it as any.\" He laughed, and raised his staff. \"So what's it going to be?\" ", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Atheas pulled his arms into the sleeves of his robe and huddled down on his nameless horse. The air had a sudden chill to it. He had just traveled through a small village, stocking up on supplies and performing small magical tricks for the local children while he rested. It had been warm then, pleasant. He surveyed the land around him curiously, then stopped his horse. He felt a small niggling feeling at the back of his mind, a feeling of... morbidity? It was growing stronger. More powerful. Then, without warning, it clicked in his head. Death magic, necromancy, the only magic he refused to use. Atheas got off his horse, stroked its mane for a few seconds, then stepped back. Suddenly, the air gave a loud crack, like thunder at point blank range, and he had vanished."}, "post-4075": {"user": "Lynx", "user_num": 179, "timestamp": "1433959386000", "message": "\"Oh no!

Lynx's anger also translated into blackness leaking out of her eyes, nose, and mouth. The blackness and anger were so thick that anyone close to her would be consumed by sadness and rage, for such was the nature of her particular dark aura, different from Jarad's aura of fear and pain.Both the blood and darkness leaked out all over the floor, a violent purple mixed with an ethereal tar-like substance, resulting in an unusual color best described as black with a purple shadow on top. The massive amount of dark energy would have a repulsing effect on Jarad's life force drain. Light and darkness were like opposite sides of magnets, one which is stronger consumes the other. However, darkness and darkness would only beat against each other angrily. And so it was when the blackness rushed out and grabbed and whipped back at Jarad's life-draining tendrils, causing them to coil like angry mating snakes, the blood making too tempting a bait for Jarad's darkness to ignore.\"Do you know what it takes to become a chaos mage?\" Lynx sneered at the infant lich. \"It takes a mastery of both light and darkness. It takes pain and suffering as well as love and kindness. As you can see, I have more than enough darkness to stand in front of you...\" A whirring sound, like a firing up turbine, emanated from Lynx's body, and the glow in her eyes intensified into a bright white. \"But if you think I'm gonna let you consume an innocent town, you're the one who shouldn't expect to live.\"She noticed Atheas' presence just then, who would be waiting just outside the barrier next to Harlen's party (unless they had the sense to flee) and Itzal (who was watching the spectacle most amused), and smirked. \"At least if I lose there's someone else who can help save the town, if Itzal doesn't kill him.\" She thought to herself.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"Oh no!
