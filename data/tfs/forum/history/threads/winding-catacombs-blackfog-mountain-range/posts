Somewhere near the foot of the mountains, one could find a small crevice large enough for a man and horse to squeeze through, with a tunnel that snakes off down into the darkness.As one treks deeper, the tunnel begins to widen into caverns with ridges and shelves, stalagmites and stalactites, and branch into more winding corridors - and it becomes far too easy for one to become lost and loop about in circles. The stones and pillars are roughly formed, seemingly by nature's course itself.The further one goes into the darkness, the more a form of civilization comes to light - carved walls cracked and weathered, crates and caskets and vases worn by time scattered about and hardly in any salvageable condition, blackened torches that haven't seen flame in years hanging off the walls. The only light sources to be found are faint glows from uncut stones high in the ceilings. But the most predominating feature in this deep a journey through the catacombs - the growing presence of cobwebs and spider silk, blanketing the walls and floor, and hanging in strips from the ceiling. And no matter where one looks, there's a lingering feeling of prying eyes from the dark shadows - and rarely one might see sets of eyes glowering like tiny candle lights.To come this far into the darkness is to be well within Lady Luck's grace, or brought in by Death's grasp. None have managed to get this far in and return to the surface to tell of what lies at the heart of the catacombs - a grand, hollow chamber that seemed to serve as a gathering hall or den at one point from a lost civilization. Massive columns stretch well overhead to the rounded ceiling 30 to 40 feet above the ground, intricate details and art carved into the very stone to depict stories and missions and fabled persons from a lifetime ago. The single tunnel leading to this point narrows to a bridge that is one of several - each meeting to a center point in the center of a still, stagnant pool beneath them. And it is here at the intersection a mass of spider webbing is formed for a nest. Within the water one could easily seen bones and skulls settled in small mounds beneath the surface - certainly more fresh than the creation of the hall. And at the end of the other connecting bridges? Hollow, shallow chambers with small mounds of uncut gemstones from the very earth. Amethysts, rubies, sapphires, tiger eyes, onyx - any precious gem to be thought of can be found - and each mound of this hoard sits in silence behind walls of web in those hollows.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/kamIdrs.png", "http://i.imgur.com/3cAjCrK.jpg", "http://i.imgur.com/Glba1Mz.jpg"], "html": "<font face=\"times new roman\"><i>The mountain range is renowned for the dangers along the trails and in the rocks, and the number of hollows and caves that house creatures of many sorts.
