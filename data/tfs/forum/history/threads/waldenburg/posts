It was not the guards, who stood under a small shelter, nor the dirty children who played around the shanty houses.  No, it was someone else, something else.  It was a disturbing thought that would put sure to send a shiver up her back.The walk to the Dainty Dove was mostly uneventful, but was rife with glares.  Where the paths were wide she would find tall homes built of stone and wood, with shingled rooves; young and old women alike looked forlornly out of the windows, but frowned at the sight of Roxanne and quickly closed their shutters as she passed.  In the poorer districts the homes were closer together, and the streets narrower and muddier; she would pass shadowy alleyways where quiet figures eyed her from beneath their hoods.She would certainly pass through the Market Square on the way to the Dainty Dove.  There the people were a little more honest.  They were simple folk, running to and from the various shops, despite the rain.  The nearby bakery actually painted a prettier picture of the town.The Dainty Dove itself looked two-stories high.  Wooden framework lined the stone structure, and judging by its appearance it was clearly one of the older establishments around.  A stone arch curved over the wooden door, and as Roxanne entered it creaked.The first floor of the inn was fairly large, accommodating a number of round tables where one could relax.  A central hearth warmed the patrons and gave off little light in the otherwise dimly-lit room.  The wood popped and crackled as the sap within heated up.  The smell of roasted meat hovered about the place, giving it a delicious aroma.  Groups of rough, rugged men sat alone or in small groups throughout the Dove.  They all looked to be vagrants, vagabonds, or ne'er-do-wells, no better than the men she had seen in the town.  But they were paying customers, and that's all that mattered.Roxanne would find her seat on the opposite end of the tavern, where a long bar extended across the majority of the back wall, except for a smaller room nearby.  Behind the bar stood a wiry, elderly man: Amos, the inn's owner.\"Oi, we have pork on the fire.  I can have Ella fetch you some warm tea too, if that's what you'd like.\"  Amos turned to look at the small room nearby, \"Ella!  Ella, get the lass some pork and start some tea!\"\"Coming!\" came a voice from within.  In a few short moments a young lady hurried out.  She looked tired, and her hair as a mess, but she was definitely pretty.  She dutifully hurried over to the hearth and fixed Roxanne some pork.  \"Here you are, enjoy!  I will have the tea ready in a moment.\"  She was sweet and honest, a good woman.Amos could tell Roxanne was new in town and so leaned in close to talk to her.  \"How long you stayin'?  I got rooms for rent, if your interested.\"  He looked behind her and saw she attracted some stares, then whsipered, \"don't mind the men.

She could only imagine what kind of foul, twisted bodies they belonged to.Amos shook his head \"Ella, why don't you go check on that tea?\"  Indeed the brew was finished, but Roxanne could tell Amos was just trying to shoo his daughter away; Ella knew it too, and like a good girl went to fetch the tea.  \"Look, you can speak to those Hunters if you want, but I would steer clear of Drakenwald.

They got secrets, ma'am, and their secrets got secrets.\"\"But they look like hunters,\" Ella intruded, sitting Roxanne's tea near her plate and rejoining the conversation.  \"Trappers.  Lumberjacks.  Frontiersman.  They like to wear cloaks made from the pelts they collect, and walk through town with bows and axes.  They don't look like much, but they're quiet.  They keep to themselves, rarely talking to others, and never peruse the city.  In fact, no one really knows how many there are... could be a handful, or a few dozen!  The town's alright with them though, because they at least supply us with good food and warm coats.  And if some wannabe bandit gang ever tries something funny, the Hunters will be there to protect us.\"Outside the rain seemed to pick up harder and a loud thunderous boom shook the windows.

It was not exactly lavish, but it would do for now, and for those travelers who spent weeks on the cold, hard earth it was more than satisfactory.A table was also in the room, if only to offer patrons a place to sit their belongings, complete with an old, dirty mirror.  Finally there was a tub situated underneath a nozzle of sorts.  Amos went over to the nozzle and rotated a mechanism.  Steaming hot water came pouring out for a few moments until Amos turned it back off.  He smiled and looked at Roxanne.\"Nifty, eh?  Live here long enough and you learn that Lady Rain reigns supreme.

Its high walls, windows, towers, and reinforced gates implied it was some sort of castle.  \"Get her on in,\" one of the hooded men growled, taking her through the gates and into a moderately-sized room; it looked to be like a waiting room.  One of the men knocked hard on some wooden doors and after a few moments it opened.  One of the town's guardsmen peeked out and saw the hooded figures.\"More trouble, eh?\" the guard shook his head and opened the doors to reveal a large hall.  Columns on either side of the hall held up the high ceiling; a former stain-glassed set of windows had been painted over with black paint, and the hall was only lit by a few braziers.  A long, blood-red rug was unfurled along the center of the hall, leading from the entrance to a throne of sorts in the back, which was elevated on a platform.  Elsewhere the hall was covered in scaffolds; it was still being worked on.And on throne sat a man most peculiar.  He was dressed lavishly, and sat in his chair like an ignorant, boastful emperor would.  His skin was white as snow, his hair black as night.  Blood-red eyes pierced Roxanne's very soul.  Another man dressed in heavy pelts stood at the bottom of the steps, and he too turned to see Roxanne; he wore a long bushy white beard, and was very tall and strong.  Whatever conversation they were having was abruptly stopped.\"This one was causin' problems, Lord Harrot.  Askin' to many questions,\" one of the captors said.Harrot, with his piercing eyes looked unconcerned and waved a hand to dismiss the men.  \"Kill her.  She's nothing special.  Save the body.\"  Roxanne's captors grinned satisfactorily, ready to slit her throat with pride.  They might as well have pushed her down and killed her there on the spot, but then the man dressed in heavy pelts stepped forth and spoke, a growl in his voice.\"Wait!\"  The captors looked at the man with hatred, while Harrot looked at him questioningly.  \"Bait m'lord,\" was all the hunter said.The pale-skinned man looked on for a few seconds before his face grew into a devilish smile.  \"If you think it'll work.  Take her.\u00a0 We can continue our talk at another time.\"The captors started to protest but one glare from Lord Harrot and they shut their mouths.  The hunter came over and pulled Roxanne away from the men.  In doing so he leaned in and whispered \"you'll be safe with me.\"  The hunter started to back away while the hooded figures looked on angrily, cursing him.  Lord Harrot grinned slightly, his hearing having picked up what the hunter said to Roxanne.  Nevertheless the duo were allowed to safely live the throne room.Outside, after the gates were closed, the hunter led Roxanne briskly back into the town's crowded streets.  \"I'll give you two choices, girl,\" he growled, \"you can come with me, or I can cut you loose and let you go.  Either way, I can get you out of the town safely.  You won't last another night here.\"(Roxanne Fletcher    )", "link_list": ["/user/472"], "image_list": [], "html": "\"Argh,\" one of the men growled and pulled himself away, knocking the grits off of his face.  He soon rejoined the fray and they all wrestled Roxanne onto the cold, hard stone floor.  They binded her up tightly, so there would be no chance of escape unless she had some sort of magical power that could untie knots.  Those men who were wounded found themselves a place to sit nearby, at one of the tables; they cursed and cast angry glares towards Roxanne.  The other bunch that were not unharmed, or not as badly hurt, yanked Roxanne up and started to haul her out of the inn."}, "post-66616": {"user": "Roxanne Fletcher", "user_num": 472, "timestamp": "1494787423000", "message": "Throughout the whirlwind of activity, Roxanne was quiet.

But then we can't all afford the luxury of publicity, can we?\"'Bo Buck' seemed to know his way around Waldenburg quite well.  The populace looked at him with pleasure; he was one of the few unsung heroes of the town, and one of the few inhabitants they could actually trust.  Nevertheless, he didn't speak to a single one of them, and avoided eye contact with them.Finally Bo Buck and Roxanne came upon a wooden-framed two-story building with stone walls, just by the Market Square.  It was the Hunting Society's guildhall!  Up close the wood was fine-cut, expertly so.  The stone was cut near-perfect.  You would not be able to tell from a distance but this building was well-built with expert craftsmanship.  All of the windows had their shutters nailed shut, preventing anyone from looking inside.Bo Buck ascended the stone steps with Roxanne and knocked on the wooden door.  A few moments passed and a metal slot slid open, revealing two brown eyes before closing once more.  Roxanne might have heard a number of mechanisms being turned before the door finally opened.  Once the duo stepped inside Bo Buck shut the door behind him quickly and locked it back up.The initial room of the guildhouse was moderately-sized.  A clean wooden floor was covered in most spots by fine-knit rugs.  A fireplace on one side of the room lit the room and provided warmth.  Bookshelves were filled with old, dusty volumes.  There were about six chairs spread across the room, each one with a nearby table.  Everything looked to be crafted by an expert, it was surreal!\"Who's this then?\"  Roxanne would notice two men inside of the room.  One of them was a very old man, with a thin white beard and no hair on his head.  He wore a set of glasses which he used to read his book, not once looking away from its pages.  Maybe one time he was tall and strong, like Bo Buck, but now he looked fat and very old.  He pulled a pipe of tobacco from his mouth and sat it on the table, then sipped from coffee from a cup.Bo Buck had cut Roxanne's bindings off by now and removed his wet fur coat, hanging it on a coat-rack.  \"Don't know her name,\" he said before falling back into one of the chairs, grunting as he did so.  \"Bound for the grave, though.\"The other man, who sat across from the older fat one, was in his mid-forties and had a wiry build.  He had a very long brown beard and short brown hair with brown eyes.  \"So you brought a trouble-maker then?  Like we need more of those.  It's hard enough to get rid of Jon-Jon.\"Bo Buck laughed along with the two fellows, but then said \"no, no.  She's the one we heard about... this is the huntress.\"The wiry man perked up and his eyes widened.  \"Oh!\"  He stood up and offered to shake hands with Roxanne, smiling as he did so.  \"Welcome to the Hunting Society, miss!\"  He turned and looked at Bo Buck, \"Jon-Jon'll be back soon enough.\"Nodding, Roxanne's savior motioned for her to sit.  \"Sit, girl, and relax.  You're safe here... safest place in the city, actually.\"  When the girl was comfortable he would say \"as you might have guessed... Waldenburg's gone crazy.  I probably shouldn't tell you to much, but you should at least know the Hunting Society is workin; on fixin' things.  You, bein' a hunter and all, and seeing first-hand the ailments of the town, might be interested in helping us out.  But if you agree, you should know it means traveling into the Drakenwald... would you be willing to brave the dangers of the forest?\"The fat old man, still not looking away from his book, spoke up \"and don't be afraid to tell us your name either.

To be honest, Roxanne, the business of Waldenburg is... the business of Waldenburg.\"  Bo Buck grinned because he knew that it left the question unanswered.

Harrot and Drak's days are numbered, we just need more time.  All we can do now is wait.
