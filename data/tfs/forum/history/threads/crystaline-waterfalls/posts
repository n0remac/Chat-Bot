Normally her magically enchanted seeds took at least an hour to bear fruit. But in close proximity to this waterfall, they only seemed to take a few minutes. Satisfied that her camp was secure and that there was no danger present, Jun sat down and rested her feet, finally able to take in the scenery.The waterfall produced unusual, vibrant rainbows made up of more than just the standard primary and secondary colors. Jun was mesmerized by the subtle shades of teal, yellow-green, and pink that shown through in the bright sunlight. It was clear that this land was full of life force, far beyond that of normal territory. It was overwhelming in power, but gentle and sweet, full of mystery. It reminded her of her grandmother.\"I miss you... I tell you that every day and I don't know if you can hear me, but I miss you...\" Jun sighed. She normally wasn't so melancholy, but this time she couldn't help it. There was nothing exciting to distract her from the very deepest reaches of her heart. There was no catalyst for her goofy playful side. There was only her and the waterfall, and whatever mysteries it held.Jun decided to pull out her grandmother's diary, and remove her bandolier. Each scroll within the bandolier contained a spell modeled after something from her grandmother's repertoire, designed as a last resort should her normal powers fail her. Jun carefully removed each one and held it up to the sun, one at a time. If it was poorly maintained, she'd carefully channel magical energy into it to keep it fully charged.\"Rapid regeneration... check... time dilation... check... Blood... ugh...\" That scroll. One of a couple she hoped she never had to use. Her grandmother may have been benevolent, but she also did what she had to do, and had a natural affinity for the dark arts. After examining it carefully, she muttered to itself, \"it works.\" She moved on to the next of her forbidden scrolls. This one in particular she remembered Lynx had insisted she learn, if only to get over her fear of sacrifice, and to understand darkness more clearly. Just because something is meant to be used a certain way by certain people, doesn't mean it needs to be. Both her father and Lynx expressed this sentiment, but the very idea of summoning a creature like that... Jun took a knife out of her knapsack and held it up to the sun. She then carefully touched the blade to her skin and pressed down. She stopped just short of drawing blood. \"I'll be ready... I hope.\"There was one last scroll, the only scroll she hadn't personally designed. It was kept in a secret pocket underneath the others, held close to her sternum generally. It was the last scroll her grandmother had designed.\"I hope I never have to use you... although I guess I could talk to you again if I did.\" She said this with a chuckle. She examined the scroll's design carefully. It was immaculate, and of course still fully charged after all this time, with so much magical energy as to dwarf even the hidden magic of the waterfall. The irony was that of all the scrolls, this one was the most useless, the one she could probably afford to lose the most, were it not for the possibility of a very specific circumstance, one which would mean disaster for the world if it ever took place. Lynx thought it was a necessary precaution, this scroll. But the very notion that anyone should be so twisted and evil as to attempt that...Well... there are some very twisted and evil people in the world.Finally, after completing her inventory, Jun put all the scrolls back and decided to train for an hour or two before taking a nap and hitting the road once again. Although she might have liked to stick around the waterfall sooner, she decided its secrets were better left off to someone else to discover. After all, Medan was waiting, and the mysteries of humanity were just as important to her as the mysteries of nature.(Jun leaves the crystalline waterfall intact, without exposing any of its secrets.)", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "(The following takes place before Camilla's wedding with Prince Evrand, before Jun began her adventure at the main gatehouse.)"}, "post-2636": {"user": "Drayden", "user_num": 197, "timestamp": "1431715806000", "message": "\u201dMy feet hurt\u2026\u201d Drayden complained to himself, as he walked along the main road.

It wasn\u2019t as though he was in any particular rush to get anywhere after all. He was mostly just bored.As he walked, Drayden eventually sensed the faint magical properties that were emanating from the waterfall\u2019s location. It was certainly an interesting discovery to the young traveler. Spots such as those tended to be rare, not to mention a great place to kick back for a while.  It was still a ways off, but an easy decision as Drayden began to make his way to the location. The closer he got, the more he could sense the powerful mana source.When he finally made it to the waterfall, Drayden paused for a moment to appreciate the scene, standing at the bottom end of the waterfall. He already felt increasingly revitalize, as if unconsciously absorbing some of the energy that permeated this place. He then stepped closer to the water, cupping his hands and scooping some of the water into his mouth.

Sadly for Grel, however, the story was far, far longer than he had hoped.  Hours later he would be fully aware of her backstory of leaving the Grove after spending hundreds of years training with her trusty saber under the guidance of her mother, how she took a ship and managed to defeat a giant squid attempting to attack it alone (when in reality the ship she was on assisted with her by blowing its head in with a cannonball, and rather than tell her they would lie and say it was all her), how she earned money by traveling from tavern to tavern with new stories of her mother's adventures every time, how she eventually found a group of travelers looking to deliver ale to a nearby village consisting of a suspicious roguish human, a druid wearing only a loincloth but a surprising amount of knowledge of tailoring and her pet velociraptor and the hardened crossbowman with an identity crisis.  She would tell how a roving band of orcs were attacking a large city as a resistance to their policy of enslaving orcs, how she and the group were attacked by a vicious orc leader named Mal Thrakka and was saved by Mazgog the Heavy- the orc barbarian who looked at other orcs the same way her mother looked at other pixies- and how they adventured deep into the tombs under the city in search for Mal Thrakka so they could finish him off for good.  Her sword moved with her story as she told of the countless undead that attacked them and how she laughably was knocked out of the sky with little effort by them, how Mazgog managed to defeat three undead ogres on his own and was brought to near death if it were not for their druid healing him, and how they finally managed to find Mal Thrakka's layer deep under water where they were ambushed by three living ogres and countless orcs.  Her sword and storytelling lost movement as she slowly became more sullen recounting how, in her naivete, she attempted to drink a potion to help her distract the enemies better and the ogres all smashed her into the ground before the drink could touch her lips.  Mazgog would rush in to pull Birdi out, only to be surrounded and eventually pummeled to death, but not before slaughtered the ogres in a violent barbaric rage only an orc would know and falling to exhaustion.  There was a brief pause after her story as she slowly fell to the ground, her glowing wings now faint and nearly invisible in the setting sun.  It was the first time in hours that she was silent and the change in mood was extremely noticeable.\"....um.....I apologize, that story is.....well, I am quite sure you have had your fill of my daring adventures for one evening!\"  She said, cheering herself back up.  She floated back into the air and sheathed her sword.\"Perhaps after we've had some time to rest and travel I shall tell the rest of the story!\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"Oh ho!  That is a long story, my friend!  One with many surprises that require starting at the very beginning to properly tell.\"  Birdi began, excited to be able to tell one of her stories to someone.
