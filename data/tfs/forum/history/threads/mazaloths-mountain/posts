The lands around Mazaloth's Mountain are perilous, and the creatures that lurk in them merciless. The path is easily followed, yes, but will you climb to his lair with ease? Follow the path, and you shall find the volcano He lurks within after a good five minutes of walking.\u00a0The mountain is forged with iron, coating the massive lair in mighty protection. The mountain was built with tens of small hands over decades of work, the goblins' pride and hard work all for their master. Should one enter the tall, wide doorway, they would be welcomed by the simple presence of the hardworking goblins, a single leader there as tall as any human, an orc. He orders such inferior creatures around. Aside from the many levels of built-in scaffolding along the walls of the castle, along with the hanging chains and random forging appliances and metal battering rams, the interior of such a mighty castle is nothing but a lake of lava. Resting within such a lake, however, is a mighty dragon, who can only be visible by the mighty armor upon his back.------------- Mazaloth's Mountain has been destroyed, the post below is how -------The Iron Mountain shoot with might as the dragon raged within. The roar escaped the iron fortress, the ground nearby it falling into an earthquake to the dragon's rage. The beast was furious upon the foolishness of Kad and his mongrels, how they simply let the entirety of the mined gold tumble out of the furnace and fall into the lake.The dragon was seen within the fortress, nearly complete with the armored cage upon the dragon. Its entire back was coated in the Devil Iron, following all the way down to the very end of its tail, where the mighty greatsword blade was snatched onto its tail, sealed permanently now upon it. There was no hope in taking off the sword without cutting off more of the dragon's tail now, and such an idea was futile with the combination of the dragon's hide as well its armor. The wings were covered at the limbs, small, hollow, metal log-like structures covering where they could upon the dragon's wing limbs without effecting agility of them. The mighty, demonic iron jaw was replaced with one even larger now, extending past the upper jaw and decorated with convenient extra teeth and blades along the chin. The sides of its neck down to its tail were decorated with large, fat razors, as if to assist in gliding by and striking something. The chest of the mighty dragon was decorated with whatever demon iron was left over. From here, the dragon was truly something to fear.The mighty dragon was seen slamming from iron wall to iron wall, metal jaw slamming as well to prove mighty dents without any consequences. The ground below the dragon cracked open mightily, the grounds emitting a much more powerful earthquake now. The rage was like that of a child, yet the immaturity of it was irrelevant to the fact that it was still existent. The dragon roared with one last mighty cry of rage, launching a breath of fire into the ceiling above, flapping its mighty wings as it stared straight to the red ceiling.Outside, one could see the giant roof explode, followed by the roar of the dragon. But all land nearby would suffer from the earthquake brought forth by Mazaloth's Godly strength. The Hellworm, now filled with hatred, continued to dive into the canyons and wrestle with the walls to cause more earthquakes. Like a child breaking its lesser toys, the dragon completely ruined the Fire Lands. With that, the Legion of Fire died as the entirety of the iron fortress fell into the gigantic hole in the ground, the minions escaping and traveling separate ways. Except, of course, for the tens of minions remaining upon the dragon's back. No Legion could be hoped for now as the dragon proved to hold no intelligence at all, or was it maturity? Either way, the dragon would never fit for anything aside from a Legion's idol, inspiration, perhaps even their God.The dragon calmed after witnessing its destruction, barely satisfied. The dragon to the skies of blue once more, roaring mightily as it flapped its wings, igniting them quite quickly as black smoke followed behind the dragon's enormous flames, gliding forth with wings unfurled and a desire for a new lair to make. A lair near Gold, near any dragon's true desires.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://pre02.deviantart.net/f6d1/th/pre/f/2014/323/1/f/volcano_by_concept_art_house-d86zszc.jpg", "http://nevsepic.com.ua/uploads/posts/2011-09/1316543850_nevsepic_75_www.nevsepic.com.ua.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://pre02.deviantart.net/f6d1/th/pre/f/2014/323/1/f/volcano_by_concept_art_house-d86zszc.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/>"}, "post-31714": {"user": null, "user_num": null, "timestamp": "1459897911000", "message": "Building up to giant hills, the bubbling areas of lava soon died down as the breathing stopped. Mazaloth, the worm that crawled back from Hell, was stirring. A low growl escaped the partially submerged dragon, sending the hundreds of creatures into a frenzy as they prepared for the dragon's departure. From there, the chains were rode on by the goblins to the sides of the mighty iron stronghold. The battering rams were raised as high as they could. The platforms retracted and chains were dropped into the lake of hell below them as the iron back was seen moving left and right.From there, a good hundred or two stood atop the iron fortress as the dragon lowered itself into the lava. At this point in time, the demons and goblins were rushed, sprinting to two mighty wheels, levers sticking out of them. The back wall of the iron mountain was starting to open, but soon halted as the minions argued among themselves. They were not strong enough to focus on two at the same time.Then came thundering up Magmas, the Guardian of the mountain. The minions scurried to the other wheel as by itself, the monolith marched in a circle, breathing ceasing to be for it was not needed. With that, the mighty iron wall eventually came forth, pouring built-up lava in to the castle as the lake rose oh so little. But even then, a back of demon metal, glowing bright red due to the heat, was seen slithering through to the large, massive ocean of lava. From there, the dragon disappeared, completely submerged in the lava, and all went quiet. That was, until the center of this ocean exploded, a mighty roar cast out from Mazaloth as its wings flapped mightily, lava dripping from its body. The wings were ablaze, the chestpiece was glowing with magic, the eyes lit with an undying fire. From there, the dragon roared once more, starting off its travels with a mighty flap forth, black smoke trailing the large flames that soared high into the sky. No art of stealth was developed with such a creature, as stealth was not needed for such a Titan as Mazaloth.With this, the dragon had no objective. It had no motive but to fly, to enjoy itself once more. Suddenly, a roar was replaced with a mighty sound of burning, and a fire unlike any fire was released from the dragon's maw. It seemed to stretch on forever in the sky, nearly lowering to the volcanoes below it. The dragon ended its little show as it circled the castle once, before flying off towards the skies of blue.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Building up to giant hills, the bubbling areas of lava soon died down as the breathing stopped.

The dragon roared mightily, wings gliding with ease as fire engulfed them once more. The black smoke seemed to only be apparent in areas where the clouds were gone and skies ignited were viewed, which gave him all the more appearance of a phantom or demon. Returning darkness to the skies, the dragon circled the iron fortress known as its home.The stronger of the minions scurried about while Magmas prepared the walls, closing them as the ceiling would now be opened for its entry. However, the dragon's mighty size dropped down near the bridge, wings furled as it stomped forth, roaring mightily. Startling all but one, the dragon waited for the Mouth to come forth.Steam poured from the nostrils of the giant beast. A black, charred tongue came out and ground against the metal teeth below it, finishing its travel before returning to the furnace within them. Wings seemed to only glow now with intense head, the mighty tail behind him still armed and dragging across the ground in small paces. The eyes, ever aflame and glowing with power, stared at the figure which now marched forth.The figure was tall, but not an overage like the orc behind him, with arms across his chest and head raised high as a grin traveled across his face devilishly. The metal boots of the inferno clicked ever so quietly against the ground, marching with ease as its arms swayed barely. The sword pointed towards the ground farther from itself, eyes staring to the ground in front of it until it was close enough to stare straight into the dragons face. From there, a huff of steam came out, covering the Mouth as it hid bright eyes for a moment, turning around after two minutes and marching back towards the other side of the bridge.The mighty dragon flapped mighty wings, scaring some of the nearby goblins as the corrupted ones rejoiced and sprinted back towards the forges. As this scene occurred, the Mouth of Mazaloth reached its target, standing next to Bru'uk as it stared to the interior of the castle, simply speaking a few words which poured knowledge into Bru'uk's ears, already understanding what those words meant and where to go.\".... You have work to do..\"With that, Bru'uk roared mightily a war axe suddenly clanging against his shield as he marched forward. From there, he looked around for some of the newly joined allies, eventually picking one for the mission. An ogre, of all things, turning around as it ground its nose against its forearm, snorting and nodding as he roared mightily, a fair portion of the goblins rushing out of the forge with him.Turning with a jagged grin, the orc stared as the dragon laid itself into the lava once more, shaking around as it enjoyed the warmth. As if reflex, the forges were sent back, the battering rams were repositioned, and the minions continued their works. Black metal, demon metal, was now seen continuing to coat the back of the mighty dragon, and from there, Bru'uk turned himself to march up to the rooftop of the castle. From there, he stared around him, to see all of the lands of fire, grinning and throwing his arms upwards and roaring mightily with pride. In his peripheral view, the ogre and its minions were just leaving the borders, and heading south, towards the sands of Sakand.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://27.media.tumblr.com/jbf1LsxRynzdtwrmUz5Ne835o1_500.jpg"], "html": "The red lightning and erupting grounds seemed to tremble even more now as Mazaloth returned to the skies of darkness and fire.
