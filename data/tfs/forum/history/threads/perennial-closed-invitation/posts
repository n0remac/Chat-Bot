A curious habitat of about one squared kilometre that abruptly ends with a sheer drop into a twilight void that surrounds all. The Perennial Place cannot be reached by foot, horse, boat or flight and only certain individuals will ever find a way opened for them.In the centre of this land, a tall tree-house stands with stairs that wind up around the trunk and out-buildings placed at different heights along thick, arm-like branches. The canopy above is so thick that it provides shelter from the rain and between the leaves live a curious faefolk native to this land.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/BSHC7JA.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/BSHC7JA.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/></div>"}}
