Oliver produced some flint and steel, giving it to Silas telling him to make a fire while he went hunting.  Fire made, Silas sat on a mossy rock and relaxed.

I doubt they even exist.\"Silas was further impressed as Oliver continued to gut the dear and make a stew (he had some cooking utensils in his shoulder bag) with nettles, mushrooms, tubers, and blessedly some salt.  The rest of the meat he smoked with the contraption he had made earlier.  \"What a meal.\" Silas said patting his belly. \"For that I'll take first watch.\"\"A watch??\" Oliver complained.  \"Why do we need to keep watch?\" \"Something seems a little eery about this forest...Don't you agree?

The canopy and intertwining, connected highways of branches might have been safer at night, but in the daylight Flare much preferred being able to hide down with the fallen leaves and roots. Plus... He was unlikely to fall to his death if he he couldn't fall! It was a decent starting plan, one that could absolutely not go wrong!After a moment, he turned away from the trunk and leaped into the air with his arms and legs outstretched. Soon the air that blew through the trees caused his torn wings to spread outwards as though they could actually carry him in flight and slow his fall into a soft glide that ended when he reached a ground of crumpled leaves and dusted himself off.\"Right. This way-!\" He called to himself, choosing the direction he was at least pretty sure the bird had been flying in and then setting off in a walkto follow it.
