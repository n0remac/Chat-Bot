Although not nearly as tall as the giantess, the dragon's wingspan dwarfed the platoon as it picked up snow and dust from its flyby.  It moved at incredible speeds towards the woman before hovering and eventually landing in front of her.  The woman sat on the ground, legs crossed as she looked down to the elderly creature.  Its golden scales glowed in the sun as it looked up to the giantess with a smile.\"Ah....Magnhild....finish your nap?\"  It said in a low, but teasing voice.  The giant woman let out a small chuckle, smiling a little.\"I'm surprised my voice reached you at all, old one.  Did you forget your hearing aid?\"  The giantess responded, her voice warmer than Fenris had heard.  The dragon returned a chuckle as well.\"Yes, yes, get your quips out of the way, youngin'....\"He waved the conversation away with a flick of his claw before looking around.  The woman spoke up.\"It's good to see you again, Alphamar.  I wanted to ask, how long have I been asleep?\"\"Oh....a few years, I believe.  I haven't seen you in a while....\"The dragon looked over to the humans, gesturing to them after a moment.\"And already you're quite popular judging by that little army over there.\"The giantess followed his finger before scoffing and waving the group off.\"Oh, them.  Merchants, probably.  Found one of them in my cave when I woke up, I have no idea how long it was watching me.  It had the audacity to speak to me in my language!  My own language!  And then it threatened me by saying I'd have to remove it from my own cave!\"Alphamar sighed and patted Magnhild's arm, stretching upwards slightly to do so.\"Oh, let it go, let it go....they're a curious race, quite intelligent even.  The fact they could understand you at all is proof of that.  They mean no harm.
