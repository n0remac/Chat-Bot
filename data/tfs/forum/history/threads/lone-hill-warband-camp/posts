His partner had long stopped singing and had fallen asleep about his shoulder, as she was on his back. Her head placed upon his right shoulder ever so lightly, he knew that she was comfortable. Though, that did not stop him from admiring the environment as he listened to his guide into this un explored territory. Though, she appeared to be sleep. It was only, to give her some rest from the primary physical functions of being on this plane. Her own body belonged on a higher plan than the one the humans were walking across, she communicated with him through their mental link. She told him of her day, before they had came her. Her day...consisted of the usual: Killing, slaughtering, humiliating, shopping, and getting her nails done. She was a very simple female to Shawn at times when she wasn't very emotional, which he thought was brought about by years of being mistreated by earlier magicians who had summoned her, and to his surprise none found her attractive. It was very uncommon that was, to not find a beautiful girl...well...beautiful. He tuned back in to his guide's words just as they entered the small, but organized village. The murmurs of the villagers, the whispers of the people as the passed. Though...he was no surprised as his lover's eyes snapped open towards such whispers. She hated mumbling and this was going to be a serious problem. He was glad when they came face to face with the leader. It was an appeasing sight, to hear all the murmuring stop, and the leader address a question to them. Though, before he could respond. She spoke mentally, to him: \"Please...can we just kill them and get out of here?\"\u00a0She pondered. Shawn looked at the leader giving a small nod of respect before responding to her. \"No...We have to stay for the night...We have to feel out the village and really understand them. Then we explore other options...if they refuse? Then we may slaughter them, and use their souls as fuel to upgrade your prowess and that of my ring of Oden. Ok?\" He mentally, replied. She just huffed and kept her head down upon his shoulder looking up at the massive being with such a hatred it practically, radiated off of her. That's where Shawn spoke. \"I am from Edina..a Realm outside of your own..\" He turned to his Amante. She didn't even blink, though her purple radiant eyes barely visible beneath the veil. \"I am from the seventh plane of existence.\" Though she spoke from in front of herself, her voice echoed from all directions. The spell she had said swirled about in her body as she waited, still murmuring the lyrics of the Gallic incantations to herself. Shawn sighed at her express, though he couldn't blame her.

Tables of different sizes and shapes formed an outside circle around the center of the tent, mismatched hosts to a dazzling array of incense, books, ancient runes, potion bottles, and the like.

Yet, perhaps the most interesting of it all was a small red crystal, glowing ever so slightly red, laying on one of the tables with an assortment of cryptic parchment drawings and runes.The crystal had what could be felt to the practiced mage as a powerful push, a repressive force that fizzled out magical conjurations with indiscriminate judgment.

There was a lot of holes in the plan..Though basically, this is what was to happen.\u00a0First: Exousia was to put her illusion spell,\u00a0feitizo ilusi\u00f3n . Then she would hold that spell as she followed the ambush squad to a distant area, where. Shawn would activate his spell Inferno. Which would protect the archers and men from the she-beast. The inferno was a wall of brightly colored flames that could melt through rocks, he would just allow, mini holes in the wall to allow the arrows to fly through. As, him and Wolfgang fought to get to the beasts underside. The leader of this village made it clear, that his men were to have little to no\u00a0casualties. Shawn was apart of a royal guard for his king back in his universe and had plenty of\u00a0experience stopping unwanted deaths. This was going to be difficult....he had to let his lover go and draw her out...and lead her to the 'fake' village..while, Shawn and Wolfgang set up the\u00a0\u00a0trap. As, Wolfgang gathered his men. Shawn and Exousia walked to the end of the village, to the direction of the ocean. They locked eyes with one another..no words were needed as she stepped closer into his body, his arms enclosed around her hips, and their eyes locked. The mix of the purple gaze and his deep hazel one was one that could be described as beautiful. Then they leaned in to each other, the sound of rustling, and orders being given as their lips locked in a tight, and passionate embrace. A river of emotions flowed about from this kiss, that seemed to be proof of their never ending emotional connection. She felt that familiar rush of a warm...and smooth...intense feeling that ran through her body, and made her clutch onto him. As, he felt the same electric and imminent burst, of emotion and passion that seared into his very soul. A smile, came to both of their lips, and the mental words were said..I love you..and she was gone. A dash of unbelievable speed, towards the ocean. Her form shimmered with light, and melted into a large white\u00a0Siberian tiger. That\u00a0\u00a0sped towards the ocean. As, Shawn followed Wolfgang to the location he wanted, he watched the village begin to shiver out of\u00a0existence into nothing but trees. He couldn't help but turn around in her direction...worrying..That brief moment was ended by Wolfgang showing him where this trap place was, and his ring glimmered with a ray of green light as he looked around the clearing.
