The roaring bonfire crackled, in a strangely soothing way. Most of the tribe were sleeping in their tents. However, there were exceptions;''Art thee truly doing this,\u00a0Khuyildar?'', one of the elderly of the village questioned.''Indeed, I must.'' was his response.''This will be our path to power. In this cruel world, power is all that truly matters.'', he continued. ''And so, we must gather information on how to obtain this power.''It had to be on one of these nights, under a raging fire. As the fire burns, consuming all, a rift to the elemental plane is forced open - Because as the wood burns, trapped mana is released from the confines of the wooden fuel. After all, that which defines all living beings as life is just that; mana, and so, life is directly connected to the elemental plane - letting that which allows the usage of magic escape into the mortal realm, and many types of magic users to use far more powerful magic. This is the only way for Khuyildar to summon - yes, summoning magic - a being, the appearance as complex as that of a human.(Yes, I shall use this summoned being, that is to be almost akin to a human, to find the one true path to power. It shall gather information of the outside world for me, and ensure our victory. One day, we will rule a nation. Another day, the world and all its people shall be ours. Yet another day, we will ascend to godhood.) A wide, bizarrely wicked grin appeared on\u00a0Khuyildar's expression, as he thought about this.''Well then. It is time, isn't it?'', he said, just before dropping to the ground, nearly lifeless...His eyes shone a pale, blindingly bright turquoise light, for minute after minute after minute after minute after minute...Then, as the minutes passed, a humanoid body started materializing from the flames.After it had finished materializing, its appearance had revealed itself. Hair as white as snow. Skin pale enough to make anyone believe that this being had never seen the sun. Eyes, the irises of which were as red as blood or wine. - These were the most striking features of the appearance of this imitation of a human.[Will be continued in another post]", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "It was a lonely, eerily calm night.
