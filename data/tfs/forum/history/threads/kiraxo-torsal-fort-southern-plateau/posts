He'd check where his skin was still fine for any broken bones, bruising, or puncture wounds. Once he was clear, only have a few minor bruises, he would wait for the Solar Manna cubes and the High Level Salve for the burns.A few seconds later a medic popped into his room with a small tray that had the cubes, a shot glass worth of water, and two small bowls of salve.

He'd then take hold of the Solar Manna cubes and mix them into the water. He'd pour the water into Marcus's mouth slowly, refraining from making him choke and cough.

Asgeir is not 'grand' in terms of majesty.  It's a vast, barren wasteland, it's cold, snowy, rocky, and mountainous - exactly how you'd imagine the north to be.  Except for the east, which is more flat, forested, and fertile.\"\"Indeed,\" Aia, continued.  \"Our people were nearly wiped out during the Cataclysm.  But under the leadership of great heroes - like Tarro Valgard, Koros Jarn, Borg I, and Joric Horse-tamer, our land was reclaimed and we Varan united under a single banner - the first time such a thing has happened in all our history.  You may have heard of the Varan Reformation, which is a large cultural movement in the Varan race.  Our people are more focused on economy and diplomacy rather than war.  But for some us, we can't suppress the rage within us, so we become mercenaries.  For many decades since the Cataclysm, we've roamed the Overworld in search of new land and homes; so long as we receive that, we are contempt.  We value loyalty, honor, and tradition, and our warbands ask only for land - not coin; we're known to produce deadly, brutally-efficient warriors, and are highly sought after in this land.  I am in command of one such warband, currently composed of only forty-eight other shield-sisters, though we seek to grow and become one with the Free City.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Aia and Kyra listened to Izol with growing respect.  \"My people are similar to your own, Fort Master.  Everyone is Asgeir is a warrior first and foremost.  Be you a farmer, a forester, a hunter, a tailor, a builder - you're still a warrior.  It's in our blood.  From a young age, we're all trained to fight, boy and girl.
