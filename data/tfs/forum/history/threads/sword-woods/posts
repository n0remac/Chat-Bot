Theev'Nok, however, was continuing his race with Spero, not liking his actions and risks with his teammate at the time. It would be observed he wasn't fond of her, yes. But she was now formally part of the team, and as the leader it was his duty to protect his own, especially at his rank in the tribe.So from there, he'd of seen the two falling to their doom, wide eyes and gasping mightily. Grasping onto his right hammer, he leapt off of the rock with his right leg, soon hurling himself at them in a downwards direction. However, the angel, now exposed, took flight, and sent Theev'Nok completely off course.

Theev'Nok shouted and apparently cried out the more he thought of it, smashing any nearby rocks with his fists. Gently falling, his eyes were closed, nearly a quivered, whimpy breath as he pondered his death. But, the rocks had helped him once more. \"All Maker... why do you show me kindness?\" He questioned in silent breathing, noticing the massive rock gently following his pursuit downwards. Obviously fatigued with his battle from before, he gently threw his left arm over the rock, leaping upwards as his hammers appeared to be secured upon his back. This was his own test, not meant for his weaponry. From rock to rock he began leaping upwards, kicking off of falling pillars and climbing atop other rocks. \"Almost..... there....\" His voice whispered out, realizing the mist was clearing up. From there, his own appearance would now change. Crackling skin, grunts and a bellowing roar emitted from the male, as his enhanced for would now have been seen.\u00a0Pure black, a massive trail of smoke following him, Theev'Nok's own body would soon be seen. The definition of super strength would've been seen with his character, now instead of wielding a hammer, he carried with him one of the massive rocks, turning his body and hurling the rock, only to clutch onto it and do it once more. He could see the end! Leaping straight up into the sky, he chucked his rock, soon its own weight bending in on itself and it came back downwards. From there, Theev'Nok waited for it to fall, only to leap off of it, a massive boulder of darkness seen falling downwards and downwards. Only to crash with a violent intro in front of the others. So the ground around him would've crackled beneath his presence, a small bowl, if you will. His own body remained with a knee into the ground, the other leg stepped upwards, and his arms forward, panting, breathing heavily, looking up towards their feet for a moment, then hanging his head once more.From there, the beastly figure pushed himself off of the ground, which felt like nothing. He gave a good, long stare at this \"Angel\" and continued to march forward. This part of the test was over. Now all he needed was the sword. The troll had seemed to disappear now, not a part of the team anymore.

It was something right out of a story, and she found herself almost smiling.. almost.

I'm a dirty wolf who hates dresses, I don't think I qualify. I wish you luck finding your king and his magic sword, though. You should definitely be doing that instead of making sure I get back to Isra. I'm sure I can find my way.\"</font> She was sure of no such thing. Moon's sense of direction was <i>terrible</i>.
