It did not appear to be a fair fight, were there any spectators, but this was simply a match for practice, a sparring session that could clue Leiron in on his skills with his blade and shield. Lamina, young and small but of utmost confidence, stood tall in the center of the ring, drawing her mortuary sword in her right hand with a slightly audible hiss. Her right foot led a neutral stance, her left foot back and angled slightly outward, her sword poised between them at a diagonal angle in her dainty right hand.\u00a0 \u00a0 \"Ready?\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>"}, "post-4295": {"user": "Leiron", "user_num": 374, "timestamp": "1434336834000", "message": " Leiron drew his blade from its leather sheath and in a two motions took his shield of his back and onto his left hand.

Leiron's grasp probably happened around the forte, unsharpened ricasso, and basket hilt simultaneously. While he may have sustained a slight cut on his index or thumb fingers, most of his temporary handle was not sharp enough, and only a tiny amount of blood would remain when Leiron withdrew.
