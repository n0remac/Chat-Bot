She generally stayed within the forest where the creatures knew her and she knew them. Hearing movement around her was normal. On a wild hair, she might caress the clouds in the night and kiss the stars.Her belly full she brought her head up, shaking from nose to neck and tossing her lovely dark mane all around. At ease she would stare ahead - focusing her gaze on a particular collection of fireflies that danced about in a cloud of light. And shortly following them was a doe and two fawns - a small group she knew well. The herd had to be somewhere near but not smothering - they were setting in for the night and were likely here for a drink as she had been.The fawns greeted her in play, bounding around her larger form and headbutting her with their small heads, and she snorted and nickered at them in turn - gently nudging them with her own head in jest. As they bound around, they tried to catch the fireflies as well - before returning to play tag again.
