The Celadine clan was one of the more lenient ones, only requiring that agriculture and growth be part of the theme.

What would a huntress need?Jun reached into her knapsack and pulled out her father's notes. Her father was one of the best white magic users in the Celadine Clan. Her own white magic needed work, but... Jun decided it would be the most useful thing to give to Camilla.

Some of the hairs disappeared, but not all. Jun smiled. \"I've gotten better at this. Less waste this time.\" She decided she was feeling lazy and, instead of manufacturing yet another spell, went through her inventory, finding a spell she didn't really need but might serve Camilla well. She'd have to go back and rewrite some of the runes, but that wouldn't take long. And the spell was already charged. She just had to infuse it with the hairs...She was done.

Camilla would be ok on her own for a little while, and she was tired and somewhat depressed from the information overload.She got up,\u00a0 undressed, put on a sleep tunic, and re-plopped herself onto the bed, this time face down, her scepter and chains lying on a table by her side. She stared at them for a while, just stared, fish eyed.Thoughts trickled into her mind, thoughts of herself as a school girl always trying to answer all the questions the teachers asked, thoughts of her grandmother meditating at the top of the stone tower in which they lived, thoughts of her mom shooting a piece of fruit a hundred paces from the outside table, thoughts of her dad teaching the neighbors how to grow muskmelons...\"Wow, I really miss home...\"After her conversation with the demon, and hearing Anid's story, Jun had started re-evaluating her decisions in the last year. Even as she lay on her comfortable bed which belonged to a princess, anxiety set in.What would it take to obtain great power, and was it worth it?Jun wasn't the most talented mage, but she was one of the hardest working as well as a true academic. Her grandmother commented on her speaking and writing abilities and felt that she'd make a good politician someday, if she ever lost interest in magic. But after hearing about all the devastation and chaos that their world had endured, Jun felt like a more direct approach would be necessary to safeguard the world. Hence she would voraciously pursue magic, studying into the wee hours of the night, constantly challenging Lynx to duels...Then she thought of the funeral.Lynx died of old age, or so it was believed. She was in her 80s and in good health. Her mind was unbelievably sharp and though her body was frail, her magical abilities were borderline deity-like. Sometimes Jun wondered if old age was really what took her. All she remembered was crying profusely at the funeral.Her father told her she had a good heart, but that following the path of being a powerful mage wasn't easy or even necessary. Jun's true potential laid in darkness and fire magic. However, the path of light and diplomacy suited her nature much better. He once joked that just because someone has a talent for thumb-wrestling, it doesn't mean they should give up everything to become a professional thumb-wrestler. Lynx obtained insane power out of both necessity and the happenstance of a cursed and difficult life.She realized the demon she spoke to in the arena that night didn't respect her, because she simply hadn't had to suffer as much as Lynx, and to simply ask how to wield Chaos Magic was almost insulting to Lynx's memory...Her father might be disappointed that her daughter was experiencing jealousy and lust for power, even if she knew it was wrong.As it stood, Jun could perform basic elemental spells in all categories. She had managed to learn the \"Dark Bomb\" spell that Lynx invented, although Jun still wasn't keen on cutting her flesh to use it, and at best she could only get one bomb out, while Lynx could effortlessly produce dozens. The \"Coronal Shockwave\" was still out of reach, although her fire streaming spells and projectiles were well above average. Jun was starting to master rapid teleportation, and her psionic abilities were also drastically improving...But then what was the point of it all? Jun would never have the life circumstances necessarily to learn Chaos Magic. One had to experience an incredible amount of both dark and light memories to unlock said power. Lynx was a woman who was shown great love and kindness as well as terrible abuse and death, who had the pleasure of saving children's lives and playing the hero, and then shortly afterwards being forced to kill her own mother.Definitely not the sort of thing you learn in textbooks.Finally tired of thinking, Jun took one of the larger pillows and wrapped her arms and thighs around it. She thought of Ma'sum and the last night they spent together. Leaving him was probably the worst decision of all. She did vow to return to him someday though, and they were both still young. Poor guy...\"God I need to get laid!\" She grunted to herself angrily while slamming her forehead into the pillow. Her vice-grip on the pillow tightened considerably.<Exit to The Stonevale Arena>", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Having finally returned from her trek, Jun plopped herself onto the bed.
