Comprising of a fortified castle, temple and a small outlying town exclusively for those men, women and children who live and train there, Lianshe is notoriously hard to reach; designed as such, for managing to reach it alive is to pass the first test on the path to becoming a Serpent. Though it holds the title of 'citadel', Lianshe's outskirts are now filled with areas of ruins that were slowly deserted as the strength and wealth of it's masters decayed. It is quite obviously little compared to what it had once been.--------History and LoreIn a once proud Empire that no longer has a name, it was a given fact by all citizens that the Emperor and the royal family had a divine right beyond mortal men due to the favouritism expressed by their gods and ancestors. Because of this, they were chosen by the people to rule them on behalf of the gods they served, making the relationship between emperor and subject one akin to shepherd and sheep. Most of the great clans and schools of martial arts also agreed to this, happily submitting to those who held the divine right to rule even when they might themselves be considered independent and capable of waging war on a neighbour.\u00a0One clan felt differently. The Divine Serpents, as they were known because of the rumoured presence of divine blood in their founding house, felt that they not only held an equal right to rule but a superior one; that they were themselves divine. This arrogance and ambition one day led to a great civil war between the supernatural forces of the Divine Serpents and the countless numbers fielded by the Emperor; a long and difficult conflict that tore the country asunder and ushered the involvement of an age of chaos. All other clans and schools took the opportunity to expand their influence through warfare, using a mixture of trickery, deception and the lawful mandate of the emperor to accuse their rivals of being allies of the Serpents in order to legally attack each other.\u00a0After fifty years of fighting, the age of chaos was finally quelled when the Divine Serpents were defeated and forced to sign a treaty declaring everlasting loyalty to the royal family on the fate of their very souls, while also stripping them of all land and military power except for that of their ancestral home of Lianshe Citadel. Essentially forced to forever abandon their goals and imprisoned in their own home, the title 'Divine' was stripped from the name of the Serpent clan and unofficially replaced with 'Exiled'. With the war over, the Emperor's mandate was fulfilled and the legality of the wars between clans were no-more, forcing them into an era of reconstruction and peace that led into a golden age lasting for centuries that ended only with the coming of the apocalypse.\u00a0When the Five Kings rose, five legions of demonic creatures and evil spirits rose with them and laid waste to country-house and city-palace alike. The army of the empire stood little chance against the unholy beasts and soon broke and ran. The clans fared better with their ancient knowledge of martial arts and chi manipulation, but they too were soon routed and destroyed by the Five Kings and their lieutenants. When only the royal family and the court remained, they had no choice but to abandon the capital and it's people to their fate and slaughter.Yet where could they run to? Only one place remained out of touch; their self-imposed exile to their mountain leaving them an unbreakable rock standing against the tide. When the royal court reached Lianshe Citadel, they found the Exiled Serpents besieged yet quite calm; their warriors versed in ancient and forbidden arts and more than a match for the fodder of the legions. Aiding in this was the impassable terrain that surrounded them, leaving only one entrance to the Citadel that was ever-guarded and never breached.\u00a0At first, the Serpents refused to offer refuge to the emperor and his imperial court, but were soon forced to concede when reminded of the ancient treaty that now bound their souls to his service.
