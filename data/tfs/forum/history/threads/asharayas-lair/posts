Yes, beneath the veil of the waterfall was the facade of a building carved into the cliffside, all its other openings crumbled by rock or vine.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Down wide and winding pathways, into the cool of the earth and shade, lies the dragoness' home. Its made court is circular, with five arches leading to five different rooms. One for guests. One for her library. One as her own domain. One for treasure, and another for... an unknown purpose.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Columns and statues are carved from the stone. This place was once magnificent but now old and scarred. It seems as if there is only one way in or out, but every so often a cold draft comes from the unknown corridor. The rooms most lived in are the library and her sleeping quarters, messy but not a sty.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 It is clear that the dragon here has lived alone for quite some time.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "A river flows through open lands, yet is cut abruptly off by a cataract of 120 feet or more, tons of water pouring over its edge to smash against the rocks below, a swirling undertow vortex churning its waters before the wide and deep river continued its slithering path onward."}}
