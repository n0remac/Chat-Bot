How convenient.\"He put his hands to his sides, his eyes already on the lookout for dragons or other noteworthy sights. Turning to his companions, he noted the enchantments he had created on their voyage. \"Now, Ralf, I don't think I ever explained to you exactly what your shield does. Put simply, the face of the shield absorbs any energy that is directed toward it. For practicality's sake I made it efficient at absorbing kinetic energy, but less so than other forms. You wouldn't want your shield to freeze an area by absorbing all the heat in the area, would you! The best part is that the shield stores all the energy it absorbs withing itself, and can release that energy onto whatever it strikes (or strikes it) when you say the a certain code word. I picked the Asgeirian word for  YIELD , I take you know it?\"He turned then to Max, who stood gripping the railing to Hirhan's right. \"As for you Max, your sword has been granted a rather unique enchantment. It will cut through magical barriers and wards like a knife through butter. This includes things like magically enhanced dragon scale, making the utility of such a blade wide indeed. I did add one loophole, an exception if you would. The properties of the blade will not have any affect on  my  wards. This will allow me to cast defensive barriers in-front of or around you without having to worry about you destroying them inadvertently. The enchantment won't turn off, after all.\"\"Leiron, your spear's enchantment was something of an afterthought, my apologies. I only had so many reagents left after the creation of Max's sword and Ralf's shield, so a simple utility enchantment was all I could manage for now. Whenever your spear is thrown it will immediately fly back into your hand after it finishes penetrating it's target. I left a few transmutional loci open, however, so I will be able to improve it substantially once I find the right reagents. Finally, as you all know, I have placed a minor enchantment on each of your belts. Since they are all rather mundane, it was the most the material could manage. Upon contact with water each of the belts will increase it's buoyancy, allowing you to float easily even if you are wearing full armor. Probably won't be of much help inland, but you never know.\"Turning back to the sea, Hirhan smiled as he breathed in the salty sea air. \"I'm looking forward to this.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"Dung?
