Leaping into a dive between his legs would take a spring-like motion and a certain position of her body in preparation. While such could seem to occur quickly, there was a certain degree of telegraphing--enough to signal Wolfgang to take several steps back, his right hip brushing the rough wooden edge of a table, to keep her at check.

She continued circling the man, trying to find any opening she could to hit him.  For someone so large, he was surprisingly fast to keep facing her as she raced around him.

Because of that, she did the only thing she could think of.<br><br/>Keeping her eyes on Wolfgang to watch his movements, she had been advancing closer and closer with each circle.  Eventually she was close enough to make her dive.  Lurching to the side, she launched herself between Wolfgang's knees, twisting her body so she slid behind him on her stomach, just enough to get most of her body behind him.

His burly arms would reach around her ankles, an attempt to bear-hug her into a sort of awkward, upside-down, leg-locked submission, as his own left leg shot out in a fierce kick to her body.Would it be enough? Wolfgang was like a locomotive... he moved swiftly and powerfully from one movement to the next, and now the toned, hardened musculature of his leg and the thickness of his wet boot drove in for its target--a very unforgiving strike to the side of her body.
