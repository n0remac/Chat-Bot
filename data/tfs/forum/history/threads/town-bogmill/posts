Bogmill's biggest plague, however, seems to the witches of Witchwood.\u00a0 Witchwood is easy to get lost in, so a traveler should stick to the road which passes through the town, heading east and west.As stated, the Hallows Inn is the local tavern, and is the oldest and largest building in the town; it has a large dining area, and a second-story full of rooms, which patrons may rent.\u00a0 A number of traders operate small stalls around the central stone courtyard in front of the inn, selling general goods.\u00a0 There is also a local smith, stablemaster, and bakery.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/pirates/images/c/c4/AotD_Tortuga.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20101124020154"], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><img alt=\"http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/pirates/images/c/c4/AotD_Tortuga.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20101124020154\" height=\"291\" src=\"http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/pirates/images/c/c4/AotD_Tortuga.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20101124020154\" width=\"612\"/><br/></div>"}, "post-31928": {"user": "Treva Briarheart", "user_num": 1168, "timestamp": "1459991770000", "message": "\u00a0 \u00a0Treva had been walking through a dark forest for several hours.

In effect, the river flowed directly beneath the inn.  Any boats which came through the town would ride below the inn.  At this time of the day, some boats was coming through filled with a number of items, and merchants rushed over to help tie them down.The Hallows Inn was a large structure and had 3 stories.  Glass windows were all around it, but they were stained and foggy so it was hard to see inside.  The old rotten wood had a very dark, moist look to them, an effect of being in the swamp.  The porch of the inn squeaked and groaned as anyone walked across.  Some old men rocked in their rocking chairs on the porch, and you might would swear some of them were even dead!The doorway was two wooden doors, and upon entry would find a large, dimly-lit, damp room.  Many tables were in the center of the room, and booths hugged the walls.  They were all aged, beaten, and stained over the years.  All sorts of patrons were sitting down and eating all kinds of food obtained from the local forests, or delivered by boat from way upstream.  It was not a very loud inn, and most people spoke quietly or whispered, with the occasional wheezing laugh.On one end of the room was a bar, where an old bald-headed man with cut up hands washed out a mug.  \"What'cher need,\" he said blatantly, looking at anyone who walked in.  \"Care fer a drank?
