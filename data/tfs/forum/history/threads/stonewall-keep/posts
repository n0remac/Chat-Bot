The wild lands beyond its walls are home to all manner of undiscovered wonders and horrendous creatures, everything a true adventurer longs for.Stonewall Keep has seen far better days and, should you seek it out, is in a dire state of disrepair and dilapidation. The Keep itself is built upon the crest of a fairly decently sized hill, overlooking the road back east, with steep cliffs on two of it's four sides. A perilous drop into the raging river below befalls all those who linger too close and for too long. To the north, a day or twos ride away, a large mountain range, its peaks tipped with snow, stretches both east and west, blocking travel and sight northwards. Aside from the the road and the odd clearing, the immediate area is covered in a thick blanket of trees creating an autumn veil of oranges and browns as far as the eye can see.The cobbled road comes firstly upon the bridge which offers safe passage over the unruly waters below. Jagged stones protrude out of the frothing rapids filling the air with both spray and noise. The gate house stands firmly at the far side of the bridge, it's cold iron gate remaining almost perpetually closed to keep out the dangers of the forest that would readily descend upon the keep's denizens should they be given the opportunity.
