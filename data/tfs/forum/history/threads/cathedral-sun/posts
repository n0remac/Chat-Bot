They left a beaten path behind them, thanks to the horse-shoed hooves of their warhorses, the wheels of their wagons, and the march of their pilgrims.  All of the warhorses were pure white, perfectly so, well-armored and well-bred.  The men riding the steeds were well-equipped, wearing shiny plate armor, their torsos covered with a white surcoat and their backs with a white cape; both the surcoat and the cape was emblazoned with a Black Cross.  Such a retinue displayed pride and wealth.  They were Knights of the Black Cross, Crusaders from Vessia, the Knight-Brothers who had subdued the Wickan threats in Eastwick and established a respectable organization across the Overworld.But now there were but few remaining.  The threat of the Wickans, and the dark lord that they worshiped, were now vanquished; their job was complete, and there was no more need for the Brothers of the Sword to exist.  That is why many of the towering Reich-Landers laid down their weapons and returned home to their families, with stories of their great deeds in the Crusades. Their age had come and now it had passed.  But not all could return home - not after building as life in the Order of the Black Cross.  The call of righteousness yet beckoned to them; there was evil in this world, dark and powerful forces which needed to be stopped.  There were some among the Brothers who could not lay down the Sword or the Cross, and so they rallied beneath their commander, Adrian von Heschburg, and traveled with him to the Cathedral of the Sun, to join a new order and start a new age of glory.Traveling with them were pilgrims, those who wanted to make a journey to the great temple, and a supply chain which carried food, ammunition, and weapons.  Before long, they reached the Cathedral.Adrian, on his white horse, held his hand up to stop the column and then approached whoever may have been attendance at the Cathedral.  He bowed, as was custom in his homeland, and then began to speak.\"I am Adrian von Heschburg, former Komtur of the Brothers of the Sword.  These men you see behind me are what remains of our Order.

Sure, he seemed devoted, but he also seemed quite the fanatic.  Of course, there were fanatics in the Brotherhood, but Konrad was careful to ensure only level-headed individuals acquired higher ranks.  Now that Adrian came to think about it, he wondered if anyone in charge of his former Brotherhood was even devoted to the Angelist faith.  Konrad was a pretty scarred man, both mentally and physically, and some Knight-Brothers in the order passed rumors that he was an atheist.  Dietrich the Sadist was, obviously, not an Angelist; he was... well, Adrian didn't know what he was, other than a vicious attack hound that Konrad kept on a leash.  Heinrich and Gustav were two of the most loyal Knights in the order (and currently in concession with Adrian, here) but they were more geared towards following orders, not devoting themselves to Angelism.  It would seem only Father Wolfgang the Mace was the only devoted man in the higher echelons of the Brothers of the Sword.  Perhaps Angelism was a device Konrad used to promote morals and brotherhood, perhaps it was an effective means of pacifying the conquered; perhaps Konrad, and all of the Brothers were once devoted followers of the practice; but after what many of the Knights had seen, it would come as no surprise to Adrian that many had lost their faith.Adrian replied back to the knight before him with a relieved smile.  \"Yes, the pilgrims, they require food and water,\" he offered, being the selfless individual he was.  \"And perhaps some sustenance for my men as well,\" he motioned to the armored retinue behind him.The pilgrims dispersed as pilgrims do: disorderly, noisy, and somewhat greedy to get their grubby hands on whatever food they could find.  Adrian frowned at the pettiness of their behavior; but these were new followers of the Church of Lucernedeia, and they would be the very people Adrian would probably end up vowing to protect.The Knight-Brothers would be well-behaved.  They were drilled harder than most soldiers, and had been disciplined in their time not only in the Brotherhood but also in their homeland of Vessia.  They would mingle with any of the Cathedral's inhabitants and seek stables and hitching posts to rest their horses, and find suitable refuges to eat and drink themselves.Adrian approached the knight and sighed tiredly, but he was otherwise satisfied with the reception thus far.  \"I thank you, sir,\" he said, looking around and making sure his men were not out of conduct.  \"Perhaps if you could show me around the Cathedral, maybe indulge me on your practices, beliefs, and doctrines, I can be better acquainted with your order once I meet with your superiors.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Adrian was a bit cautious to approach the knight ahead of him.
