I fear we are going to need more than a lone warrior to stop this..\" He warned, looking back to the brave warrior, using his staff as enchantments of green lit up the wall of his hut, where his story began.\"Once, there was an orc upon this village. His name was Thrashnald, the most potential of Orcs. He was Chieftan of this village before Thorok, but his authority had blinded him of his boundaries. Thrashnald was the perfect warrior, combining the sword with the spell, an Arcane Berserk. He led our tribe to many fortunes, and had established our colony upon this realm. But alas, even the greatest fall to greed.\" He turned back to Roarin, seeing how focused he was upon the story before he continued.\"Then came the days of Bones. Thrashnald had been so powerful, but yet he wished for more. His hunger lead him to break the sacred rules, and to nearly end all of us: Necromancy.\" He paused for a moment, looking back to that symbol. \"That is our symbol for the Forsaken, the art of Conjuration and summoning the dead.\" He explained on a side-note. Soon turning back to his story wall, he continued: \"Thrashnald was soon halted by Thorok, with the help of our strongest warriors. But yet, he denied me the traditional banishing practice, and had created a portal to escape our judgment.\" He looked back towards Roarin.\"If you've been listening to my words, than you shall realize his hunger is means for the end of our existence. Through his ways he shall conjure and disgrace every being within this tribe, and claim his revenge as well the throne. From what happens thereafter is unknown, but the present issues are more than a handful.\" He coughed loudly, turning to the side as he marched his way over to the fire, reaching into it as he pulled out a stone chest. \"You have done your part of our bargain, for that I thank you. But please, consider this request: Thrashnald is beyond our powers. He is a being with the intent for anarchy. We have to find others to stop him from his doing, or I fear we might not live to see it.\"\u00a0With that, the shaman gave Roarin a stone box, filled to the brim with gold.

Then to the demon and angel, a small \"Hmph\" given, obviously sensing something between those two. Doobie was a bit of an interest to him still, not demonic but still holding reptilian traits. Jun, however, seemed to be a bit off, giggling the entire way. \"Then, so it is, and so it shall be. Let's go.\"He marched forward, the trolls huffing in their breath, the steps shaking the ground nearby the group as they got closer to them. But Theev'Nok continued to march forward, chest puffed out, chin raised, pride filling him at this point. A lot of chattering went on in the village, and soon everything went quiet, staring to the massive group. \"Spread out.. Konan and Jun beside me.\" He commanded them gently, as if expecting authority for this small moment of time. As he waited, a handful of people walked forward past the group: Kold'Ron, Shorbolg (Who was giving a passively surprised stare at the demon), and Rev'Nahn, who still gave a growling stare at Ymir, obviously holding the same attitude Theev'Nok had before.Once the warriors had spread out, Theev'Nok would inhale, clenching his fists, then releasing them as he slowly exhaled. His head hung, but suddenly shot up as he began his speech.\"My people of Falkreath..!! ....I have failed you, but have kept my promise. The Earth-Swords have returned to Falkreath, as they should, but not with me!\" His hands marched backwards, pulling up Jun and Konan gently to present them, gasping and murmuring going on in the tribe. \"These are the beings that All-Maker has chosen to wield this life!\" He looked down to their swords, then back to the people. \"But there has been more than just the victors not of our own blood, there have also been sightings you have been blind to.\"\"Behind me, is yes, in fact, a demon. But as well behind me is an angel. These traits have been hidden through my judgment of them upon their race. Our culture has described the demon to be evil, and horrid and deceitful, yet she has shown nothing but fear and weakness. The Angel was to bring wisdom to us, yet he'd brought conflict instead.\"He clenched his fist, walking forward as his hands shot out to the sides of him, yelling at the people. \"AND BECAUSE OF THIS HATRED, WE'VE LIVED ALONE!!!\" Calming down after a moment, he looked back to Rev'Nahn, who narrowed his eyes now deadly at Theev'Nok, obviously riled up inside. \"We've neglected our eyes to those who we've perceived as evil and drawn in only what WE believed as holy! That our eyes have cost the lives of the innocent, the pure, OUR OWN EARTH KIN! See this: That I've brought these people not of hatred, but of visage! We must realize that there, out there!\" He pointed his finger back towards the entrance. \"Is pureness! That the earth hasn't and will NOT die with us!! That the ways of old have changed, and that acceptance is the only way to find our missing spirits!!!\" He was now breathing heavy after all of this, staring back to the group.\"I've found praise among these people already, and I am not ashamed to say I've returned it. I've brought them here upon my honor, they may stay as long as they wish with equal, un-prejudice treatment, upon my honor. And if I am wrong- Which I feel has an ultimate amount of impossibility- then I shall be punished, upon MY Honor!\"\u00a0With that, he took a step back, slightly dizzy as he looked to them. Was that all he wanted to say? Was that exactly it? No, there had to be something more. Ahh, yes!Theev'Nok marched backwards, reaching out for Jun and Konan's hands that were nearby his. If he was allowed to grasp their forearms, he'd lift them up to their full extent, not his. To declare them as champions. \"These are us now.... this is what I've given to you.\" Of course, one could be confused by what the last statement meant. By given, Theev'Nok only meant presented in a more traditional way.The crowd was quiet, before suddenly, out of nowhere, a child would've started a chant. Something in their ancient tongue, but slowly could be followed along the syllables, \"Theev'Nok\", which was continued louder and louder by eventually the rest of the tribe, shouting it louder and louder with pride, happiness, respect, encouragement, inspiration, and a hundred other emotions that drove them.

Her eyes closed slightly, head tilting up and turning her face toward the sky as her ears listened to the voice on the wind. She was still quite young, but more than half her life spent training as a shaman paired with her innate earthsense meant that Zar'Dura was capable of understanding things many did not. As the wind died away and the chanting of the people rose, she opened her eyes and fixed them upon the strangers that ringed her tribe-mate, before looking at Theev'Nok himself. <font color=\"gray\">\"I see...

He pointed a finger now to this strange one, his face grimaced to what a hound or a battle troll would make, teeth bared, eyebrows narrowed, and eyes locking onto his. \"State your business, outlander!!\" He started, a hammer suddenly drawn to his lowered hand, obviously overreacting. \"You come from this, this abyss, and you wish to claim one of my own!? You've no right to bring up a request when your name isn't known upon our lands! Seeking my people!? Acting as if we're a mindless breed!?\" He snapped, a bit of saliva launching from his mouth as he stared down at the man, launching his head over to Zar'Dura. \"And you!!\" He exclaimed, narrowing his eyes, a bit softer a stare as he looked to her. \"Keep your words of the wind to yourself, no matter how important this prophecy is to you he hasn't portrayed trust to the village.\" With that, he turned around before the young one could even speak, continuing with his verbal defense towards this obviously more powerful strange one. \"Who are you. What is your business here. Why do you need her. Answer these statements, or by all that this earth has given me I shall protect my kin until my mortal blow!!!\" His voice quivered at the last statement, holding his position.

If she survives to come back, she won't leave anymore. However, if she's right...\" Theev'Nok took another step forward towards Rev'Nahn, preparing to do the same ceremonial connection to display dominance.

Place your skull upon mine, I want you to.

Fine. What if he's lying-\" \"She'll find that out on her own.\" Rev'Nahn broke the ancient tongue, speaking in english once more. \"And aside from this, it isn't us who may give permission.\" He looked back to Echoes. \"If you truly wish to take any of our blood from this home- Which is forbidden without the Shaman King's approval -you shall travel behind the main road, to the small hut that appears to be abandoned. There, and only there, will you find permission to take our kin.\" Rev'Nahn took a step forward, a gentle arm placed upon Theev'Nok's shoulder as he walked by him, getting closer to Echoes. \"This is your chance of reputation, strange one.

At that point, he would view his own father's back to outspread with wings.Then, he'd be snapped back into reality by a hand upside his temple, Shorbolg's calm face looking to him with a gentle chuckle after what he had to do, not seeing Kold'Ron's face for the eyes were stone still. \"F-Father!-\" \"It is nothing permanent, Kold'Ron my son, do not fear.\" He sighed aloud. \"I would expect Zar'Dura to tell you, of course, as everyone here seems to think you are the special shaman, which indeed you are.\" He looked back to Kold'Ron, grasping onto his arm with both of his own.\"Now, tell me! What is of the child?

His arm was eventually held, resting upon Thorok's shoulder as the Chieftan, the hand limp, yet still formed to a fist, as the villagers began walking by in a line, hands grazing over Theev'Nok's mighty, fallen fist. Towards the end of the group, which had lasted at least 17 minutes in walking alone, would be Rev'Nahn, Zash'Neck, and then Rictofen, all with even more sorrowful and sad faces, Zash'Neck going so far as to hold the knuckles of the fist up to his forehead, bowing down with closed eyes in sorrow. Continuing on, Rictofen held his hand for quite some time, tears streaming down his face, forcing himself not to cry as a wobbly sigh came from the boy's voice, letting the hand lie down loosely before walking off to the group once more.Standing around in a complete circle would be the members who wished to play the music, a way in their tribe to help carry Theev'Nok to the Heavens, rather him walk by himself. Around them would be the rest of the tribe, all with lowered heads and fists at their sides, those with a more personal bond raised high to their center chest. Zeel'Nok was seen amidst the crowd with Kold'Ron, who returned just in time for the ritual, holding onto each other with both holding a fist to their \u00a0chest, Zeel'Nok crying moreso than Kold'Ron, who shed many tears as well.Standing behind Thorok was Fal'Thoma, head hanging with sadness, but no tears. Depression lifting her fist to her chest, lip loose and nearly drooping downwards as she looked to Thorok's feet. A stone walkway towards the top of the fire would hold Thorok, directly above the pyre that rested Theev'Nok's body oh so beautifully. Closed eyes, a stone crown above his head, hammers at his sides and fists placed upon his center chest, connecting at the knuckles, he lied there.Thorok began his speech, not a moment before looking down with a heavy, depressed sigh, staring to Theev'Nok with a longing look, lifting his head up to the group around him, Rev'Nahn standing there with Zash'Neck, both holding the same torch with both of their hands, as they deserved the honor to ignite his passing.\"Here, we will cry, and mourn, and we shall watch our brother descend to the realms of peace and joy. Here lies an idol to all future-warriors, to the ones that will lead in the fights we will encounter. Here will escape our brother Theev'Nok, who has fought bravely to defend our families, each and every child as well the elderly. The Mountain of our time, the friendly giant, the guardian of the Frok'Nold!\" His fist was raised high into the sky, a shaman crawling towards him with a strange bowl, waiting for the speech to finish.\"Now we will mourn over the passing of our beloved. But those who know better will realize he has not passed! Even now he rests in the heavens, the sheer size of Mathladeem himself as he stares down with watchful eyes, daring all who come in violence to step into our boundaries. May he be heard in the stories of our fathers, and their descendants who fall from their fruitful arms!! May he be recognized and remembered as the defender of the Frok'Nold who he truly was!! May he walk with feet that shake the earth's spirit in excitement that he yet again wishes to visit this realm!!!\" He shot his fist higher into the air, the constantly added commotion now even growing louder with cheer at this point in the speech.\"And from here, let us release him!! For his duties as a Frok'Nold cannot be postponed any longer!!\" His hand lowered to the bowl, remaining there as the music began to rise up in volume to a calming, but still loud, level, Rev'Nahn and Zash'Neck marching forward and placing the torch to rest against Theev'Nok's pyre, with one last statement from Thorok the ritual continued in silence.\"And now, Theev'Nok of Falkreath, you will rise to the heavens, and cover this homeland with your ever-loving arms.... May the days be fruitful with your protection, and our futures inevitably safer with your watchful eyes... Be released...\"With that, the arm was lifted from the bowl, and the ritual shaman ducked off towards the crowd once more, looking with sorrowful, yet inspired, eyes. Thorok's fist held a large amount of marble, ground into a fine, fine dust. As the fire continued, the song was heard in a complete rhythm, and Thorok's hand was raised over the fire, slowly dropping the powder atop of his fists and chest, holding it there ceremonially until the song ended, stepping down from the pyre with weakened legs and a cramped arm, staring down to Theev'Nok for a long moment before returning to his Hut, as he was no longer permitted to see his beloved brother fade to another realm.Standing at the front with ultimate respect would be Zar'Dura, for she was with him at his passing moment. Rev'Nahn to her right, and Zash'Neck to her left, small space between them as their outer arms were placed with a mighty fist upon their chest, letting Zar'Dura act how she wished to.

It was time, that for once, Shorbolg had fought.The egg shell was held in his hands frailly, knowing its delicateness all too well. He chanted in a whisper, barely any voice to his words as he circled the egg out as far as he could reach around in a circular formation. Then his volume increased, smoke rising from the egg suddenly. Green smoke. He continued this, more smoke plooming upwards as he chanted constantly, non-stop at that. His eyes glowed, his back began to glow as well, with symbols of wings. Upon his head grew a strange crown in glowing green symbols, and his eyes intensified as he spoke. His voice echoed with that of a hundred-fold in his tiny hut. He was now speaking out loud, the green fire from the crucible in front of Shorbolg mimicked in the egg, now ablaze in the depth of it, hissing out a rattle from the egg shells inside of it sizzling, more green smoke rising.And from here, the talking turned to shouting, and shouting to a yell. Tucking the egg close to his chest, putting out the fire, his chanting grew louder, now as loud as he could shout as he forced his hands upwards into the air. Suddenly, his loudness was disrupted, a massive, enormous sphere covering his hut, a beam shooting high into the sky as lightning crackled in green from the orb into and on the hut, zapping Shorbolg every now and then, making him jitter and flinch as he knew now was no time to back up. The chanting kept at the volume, however picked up in voices from the orb, echoing his words around to match the volume of a dragon's at one point, then blinding light to all who looked to the hut, a strange humming power heard at the last few seconds before the blinding moment.It seemed to be bright for a few seconds, roughly around 14, when things began to fade back into vision. From there, inside of his hut, it glowed a teal aura, smoke rising from the holes leading inwards to the hut. Suddenly, the door opened wide, and it would be a stranger who walked out at a dramatic pace, staring to the group that looked with worry.He was silent, standing there for a moment with eyes that displayed power, authority, and age. He glanced to the group, before stepping out further to be viewed, however, none were brave enough to near the lands that bordered his hut at this time.\u00a0He had wings, and mighty horns, those were the first to be recognized. Then came the fact of purple skin, what many of the Frok'Nold's shades changed to when emitting a powerful spell to boost themselves, trading their natural skin tone with the tattoos upon them. It seemed to be the opposite for this figure. Hair, like that of youth, floating above his head, as for the moment gravity seemed sterile. And eyes... eyes that glowed continuously, and did not fade from that brightness. Eyes that told the magic of centuries on end, that told the understanding of what Frok'Nold wielded as spells. This proved hard to see where exactly the figure stared, aside from his head positioning to face wherever it was he was looking.And so from there, not much else could've been seen, aside from ragged trousers, as the being suddenly lifted to the sky, wings mightily flapping upwards and he took off with speed, spinning into the air before stretching his wings out, gliding with a fast pace southeast from their direction, over the tribe, a barrier of green magic covering the front of him now like a meteor falling to the sky, increasing in speed as this occurred.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://www.wowgirl.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/10272-world-of-warcraft-demon-hunter-illidan-stormrage-1773-e1439424203291.jpg"], "html": "Many, many moments were laid there with a hand to his heart, sighing heavily with a saddened face.

Within Thorok's eyes came a blur, as he stared to the oncoming warrior, his spear loosened from his grip, his eyes widened, mouth opened wide, arms hanging and growing weak within his legs. This cannot be. Those were the only words that traveled through Thorok's head as he continued to watch a silent God glide towards them.The warriors readied themselves, as they had faith in their number against Rag'Novok.\u00a0@rev   readied his shields, hurling them to all of the ground troops that chose shield over sword, pounding mightily upon the outside forge on raw iron to craft decent shields in the small amount of time he had, while\u00a0@zash   readied his archers, lining them all around the stronghold of Falkreath.@koldron   readied the Shamans as\u00a0@hyydra   was nowhere to be seen at this time,\u00a0@zeef  tending to the trolls as best as she could with the fear of the dragon and Thrashnald stirring within her.\u00a0@orflagom  was seen roaring out his commands, bears by his side as he sprinted to the barracks, where\u00a0@talmoond  would be seen amongst the other half of warriors pouring from the underground sanctum with shield and arrow, ready for whatever hellfire Thrashnald was about to unleash upon them.\u00a0@kutlag   Marched his way forth from the Entryway, stepping into the threshold of his sacred home to witness what was occurring with fearing eyes, standing there with loose arms and horror in his soul.\"What shall we do!?\" \"Hold your ground, remember the All-Maker!!!\" \"It is Rag'Novok!!!\" \"Remember the All-Maker as we stand our ground!!\" \"We must run!!!!\" \"Ready positions!!\" \"All-Maker!!!\" \"Rag'Novok!!\" \"Thrashnald!!!!\"It blurred down to those three words, drifting through Thorok's head as he continued to stare up to Thrashnald. Even from that distance, he could sense the locked eyes of such a rival, hatred and envy and rage spinning within both of them. As Thrashnald drew closer, his body could be seen relaxed, legs flexed, however, as he held tight onto the dragon's neck, sword heated from the dragon's fire as it left a trail of power through the sky.Here, here was when Thorok considered giving up. Here was when he imagined the worst to occur. Thrashnald had won. He would become the Chieftan of a broken race, and most likely extinct after Thrashnald claimed his revenge. There was nothing to derive them. Nothing to stop their hatred. Nothing to dist-\u00a0It was then Thorok was truly shocked, pupils dilating and mouth parting, where a chill ran down his spine. From there, Thorok snapped back into reality, staring down to the necklace he held around his neck, ripping it off as he dashed forth to the entryway. His hands glowed to the forearms downward to his hands green, charging his spells as he whipped the stone walls away from the entryway. From there, he dashed around Falkreath's borders, sprinting towards the back of it, where the Chieftan's hut would be. At this point, the dragon circled around Falkreath as Thrashnald delivered his speech.\"Falkreath!! I have returned!! But not in peace, as many hoped! No! My right to Chieftan has been ripped from me, and for this you shall have the dignity and honor as Frok'Nold ripped from yo-\"Suddenly, a massive pillar of stone rose from the ground behind Falkreath. The desolate wastelands of stone, suddenly bringing forth this massive construct. The titan boulder was the size of a hundred mountains, growing from such a standing point as twenty feet above Thorok. Dwarfing the size of Thrashnald and Rag'Novok, sudden surprise and shock were lifted to the minds of the future victors. But the glow, the magic that flowed like nectar upwards into the rock, as if an insect to light, Rag'Novok flew forth, roaring mightily once more. \"What are you doing!!?\" Roared out Thrashnald in anger and surprise to see the sudden betrayal this dragon gave.\u00a0The dragon slammed itself against the rock,growing in size and forming to be that of a titan, but yet, absorbing no stone. The dragon was being morphed and mutated by the sheer magic that coursed through the stone. From there, the claws of the dragon glowed, and as the Titan was the same height of the giant mountain, it gave him the strength to open it.\u00a0From there, Thorok sprinted as fast as he could away from the feet which slammed to the ground, sending a massive current which threw the nearby ground along with Thorok tens of feet away. The dragon roared out mightily as it continued to pry open the giant wall, when suddenly, the mighty humming of magic, the sound of a hundred choirs in chant, was unleashed, sending the massive mountain halves in either direction, stretching far and wide, to the point where it seemed infinite in the eyes of the simple tribal members. Through the golden glowing portal... home could be seen.The skies proved another shade as well dimension, the land was a separate soil, the formations of the earth were different. From there, all three, Rag'Novok, Thrashnald, and Thorok, along with the tribe, all stared in awe at the portal, standing as tall as past the sky and the atmosphere. From there, suddenly, the mountain halves cut apart to form quarters, sending forth two quarters towards the inhabited land, making Thrashnald and Rag'Novok roar mightily in shock as they were suddenly consumed and ignited into golden ash by the portal. This followed with the stone, and the air glowed, and Thorok was the next to be consumed. Then the people. Then the Stone Plains, stretching so far as to end at the Jungle of Kardeth's consumption. From there, the mighty, massive light construct hummed and glowed with mighty power.And with sudden recognition that its duty was fulfilled, the mountain quarters suddenly with a Godly speed sprinted into each other at the beginning of the portal's formation, a click heard as stone collided with stone, emitting a golden, massive explosion and the stone becoming solid once more, giving off a blinding light before it would die down, and nothing would be anymore. The very land which Falkreath was upon, the Stone Plains, the Jungle of Kardeth... all was gone.(OOC Time:Ahem, hello there, yes, it's me. This indeed is what it's guessed at: A departure, a farewell from the community with one triumphant goodbye. Don't worry about Thorok, Thrashnald [where I'm not quite sure why you would be] and Rag'Novok, as well the Frok'Nold, they are safe, with me. I must say, I'm quite happy with who I've met here, and am content with the fact you've been reading this far as to read this farewell. I take pride in the fact I've attracted such amazing and delightful members such as yourself to read my writings, and I truly appreciate your time to read this saddening, but hopeful, farewell. You see, they were teleported, which means with the right magic they could always come back. But I'm not referring to spells of the sort, nor am I of the magic characters can find. I'm referring to the magic you've given to me, that of the enjoyment I've felt coming from your comprehension of my writing. We felt happy together, we felt sad together. We've felt anger and intensity together! And yet, we've stuck it out to the end, and from there, maybe the Frok'Nold shall return to this realm, perhaps not. That is all but a mystery, and I just relish the mysteries of our worlds. So now, pay attention to Isra, to Gauldin, to Asgeir. But more importantly, and most: Pay attention to one another. Adventures are crafted with the alliance of amazing people like yourselves, I have the honor to give you this message, and I am still once again proud to consider you one of my fans, for as soft as I can put that.I \u00a0thank you,\u00a0Admin , for giving me this opportunity. It truly is of highest honors to have been part of this. However, I have one small favor to ask. The Jungle of Kardeth, The Stone Plains, and Falkreath: The Stone Orc Settlement, all to be sent to the history file. If you wish to delete the other two, that is fine, but I would kindly give you my supplication to let this exist. It was fun while it lasted, I can say that much.\u00a0I want to thank\u00a0Alden Marshal ,\u00a0Moonflower L\u00e0idir ,\u00a0Empress Naoki ,\u00a0Cyronin the Blue ,\u00a0Konan ,\u00a0Goraia ,\u00a0Grandma ,\u00a0Jun of the Celadine , Andraste Ruana,\u00a0and\u00a0Doobie du Shoobie  for all conversing with me.

I truly hope you all stay around for some while still, even with my departure. After all, Admin has put a lot of work into this, hasn't she?Once again, thank you all for being here with me, I've had moments I'll never forget here.All-Maker Guide you.)", "link_list": ["/user/1", "/user/794", "/user/1010", "/user/607", "/user/807", "/user/1039", "/user/76", "/user/602", "/user/108", "/user/264", "/user/250"], "image_list": ["http://www.messagetoeagle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/doorwayanotherdimension.jpg"], "html": "From here, the Prophecies would bend and warp, shrivel and die, as a new meaning to existence was born.
