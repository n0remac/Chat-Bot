The other figure didn't respond. \"A little dry, but this sun!  Man it feels good!  A lot better than that anti-magic dump, that's for sure.\"\"Let's just hope you didn't forget some details for this place too, like maybe it's filled with the undead, or there's an army about to kill us all....\"  The figure retorted in a young man's voice.

You know how much I hate The First World....\"The man removed the hood, revealing a young elven face.  He looked up to the woman with sincere eyes.\"It hurt me as much as it hurt you, Phoebe.  I had to though, otherwise they'd kill you.\"The woman didn't respond at first but sighed and had a slight smile on her face.\"Yeah....sorry.\"The two hugged, mostly the woman nearly crushing him, before continuing on through the streets.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The sun above baked the desert, causing wisps of heal to bend and manipulate the landscape.
