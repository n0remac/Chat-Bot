This was undoubtedly the marketplace the guard had spoken of and now she simply needed to find a shop that peaked her interest. Her gaze wandered around the various stalls and shops, searching for something that appealed to her.That\u2019s when she felt the presence of magic coming from one of the shops. The sign denoting it as the Blind Witch\u2019s Tome. Knocking with her cane on the interior of the carriage to signal a halt, it was only a few moments later that her younger driver opened the carriage door, his face turned downward and a general air of submissiveness about him. Hopping down from the carriage with surprising agility, cane still in hand, Grandma addressed the older driver.\u201cPark the carriage somewhere nearby, I\u2019ll be visiting these various shops. You\u2019ll know if I need you.\u201dWithout waiting for a response, Grandma walked towards the entrance of the Blind Witch\u2019s Tome. Pulling the door open, she entered the shop, her cane clicking as she approached whoever appeared to be running the shop. If one had a sharp eye, they might notice the black gem capping her cane was diminishing the light directly around it, although this effect wasn\u2019t particularly noticeable. \u201cThis is a fine shop you have here. It seems the rumors I\u2019ve heard about Levantine having some interesting magic aren\u2019t entirely hearsay.\u201d Grandma wore a warm smile as she spoke, her statement directed towards the owner of the store.
