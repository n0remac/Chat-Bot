He didn't know what people or creatures came out at night in this city, but something about the ruins that filled its streets made him uneasy. He looked up at what remained of the castle. It had not aged well, the sea air causing the walls to deteriorate at a faster rate than normal. He shook his head and sighed. Unless he could find a hidden room somewhere, he was almost certain he'd have to go into the less explored catacombs below to find anything that hadn't been looted. Tightening his coat around him to fend off the cold night air, he entered the decrepit castle. There had been some attempt to board the doors up, but the wooden planks laid uselessly on the ground nearby. Walking inside, he could see that the structural damage was just as bad inside as it was outside. He wandered the ruined halls and corridors. The place had been picked clean by any number of looters and raiders, and what they had left was rotten and useless. He did manage to find a secret compartment in an old bedchamber, but evidently so had someone else, as its only contents were a few spiders and a dead rat. Coming to a sturdy door towards the back of the castle, he could hear the sound of water and wind coming from behind it. Opening it cautiously, he found a stone stairwell descending into an impenetrable darkness. The catacombs. He had hoped against hope itself that he wouldn't have to go down there, but it seemed he had little choice. With great trepidation, he walked down the crumbling stone stairs into the darkness.He paused at the bottom of the stairs, thankful for what little light came in through the open doorway above. Reaching into his pack, he pulled out his spell book and flipped through the pages, finally finding one that would work. Raising his right hand and muttering a few short phrases, a ghostly blue orb appeared over his shoulder, providing light like a small torch. Tucking the book back into his bag, he worked his way deeper into the catacombs, leaving behind the last rays of natural light he would see for a while. The catacombs were cold, mossy, and falling apart, but the structure seemed to have been carved out of the rock directly under the castle, giving it greater stability than the building above. The sound of his boots splashing in the water was the only noise he could hear for a while. Even the wind seemed to have gone silent as he worked his way deeper through the tunnels, deeper underground. At several points he considered going back, but this may have been his only chance before they left to look for any clues. The farther down he went, the deeper the water would get. He even found some areas where the water had completely flooded tunnels. There was one tunnel, however, that drew his attention more so than the others. While the other paths had been little more than cavelike passages through the tombs, there was one containing a stairwell, completely submerged. He could see, just barely, a door at the bottom of the stairwell. No ordinary door, either, but one made apparently of solid metal, judging from the glint it gave in the low light of his orb.The fact that it hadn't rusted under the years of exposure to the sea was perhaps the most curious thing. Looking around, he decided that if anything was worth investigating, it would be this. Setting his bag aside, he kneeled down in front of the pool of sea water and let the palms of his hands just barely breach the water. He closed his eyes and focused, channeling his energy into his hands. Slowly, frost formed on his hands and in the water immediately surrounding them. He began moving his hands across the water's surface and chanting a cryptic spell. The ice began to spread faster, and as it did, it pushed the water away from the center, creating a narrow passage down the stairwell. It took a while for the path to be clear enough for him to enter, and for him to be certain the ice would hold. He could have done it faster and easier if he had used a stronger spell, but he wanted to conserve his energy. While he had been casting, the catacombs seemed to groan around him, and the water almost whispered to him as it froze. Picking up his pack, he went down the stairwell quickly, and approached the door. Just as he had thought, the door had no evidence of rust or wear on it. There was something behind this door, but he wasn't sure what. He began to investigate the door.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<Enter from The Jovial Jester Inn>"}, "post-2259": {"user": null, "user_num": null, "timestamp": "1431231233000", "message": "Harlen leaned against a wall, panting. He felt like he'd been going at this door for hours (which he had), and he hadn't even made a dent. Literally. The door remained unmarred, despite a barrage of physical and magical attempts to get it to open. He was beginning to question whether it was actually a door. It had no handle or lock, just a solid piece of polished steel, but something deep down told him that there was something behind it, something worth protecting. He pulled himself up and away from the wall, and cursed lightly under his breath. His entire backside was damp from the ice, which had apparently begun to melt. He could see the worn stone walls behind the ice. Then it struck him.The door may be impenetrable, but the walls probably weren't.He felt water drip on his face. He didn't have much time. The ice was melting, he was tired, and the group would begin to worry if he didn't return to the inn. Taking a whiff of his smelling salts to clear his mind, he prepared for one final push. Placing his hands on the ice, they began to glow softly. Luckily, he had created the ice in the first place, making it slightly more pliable to his will. Focusing and chanting, the ice began to shift, and behind its clear wall, Harlen could see the ice worming its way into the crevices and cracks of the wall, tearing it down bit by bit. It became more difficult the farther he got into the solid stone, and he was forced to use more energy to get the ice further. The more he manipulated the ice, the faster the rest around him seemed to melt. When he had worked his way to the stone wall next to whatever was behind the door, he felt a sudden surge of resistance. He tried to maintain his push, but the wall held firm. The water was up to his ankles now, and he felt thoroughly defeated. He was about to turn away, but something inside of him seemed to snap for a moment. He refused to go back empty handed, or at least defeated by a simple enchanted door. Raising his cane, he began to physically assault the wall in a rage, striking it with all his strength. At first nothing seemed to happen, but as he attacked, he got angrier. And the angrier he got, the more energy he let loose. With one final strike, his cane's black metal seemed to turn as black as the void, and the end of it pierced right through the wall. The rest of the stone crumbled around it, and just beyond he found a small, dark room. Looking down, the water was well up to his knees now, and rising fast. It didn't seem to enter the room, however, but simply stopped where the wall had been. A cold wind emanated from the room, making him uneasy, but the water would overtake him soon. Shaking his head, he stepped through the hole.His ghost light seemed particularly dim inside the cramped stone chamber, barely extending more than a foot or two away from his body. Looking back, he could see the water climbing higher as the melting process accelerated without his energy to chill the ice, soon reaching the ceiling of the passage. He hoped he wouldn't have to return that way. Turning back towards the room, he was disappointed to find it mostly empty. The only thing in the room was a simple, unadorned stone coffin. He wasn't sure what he was expecting, but something more grandiose had seemed appropriate. Still, if this was his prize for that ridiculous blockade of a door, he was going to take it. Approaching it slowly, he raised his cane, and once he was close enough, he used it to push the coffin's lid off. At first it wouldn't budge, but with a bit more force it slowly began to slide, until it finally fell off the edge with a deafening thud. He jumped back, startled, and took a moment to regain his composure before examining the coffin's contents.What he found shocked him. Despite the good condition of the room, considering how deep he was in the catacombs, this room had to have been as old as the city, if not older. Yet the body inside, that of a young elven man with flowing black hair, looked as if he had not been dead for more than an hour. His skin was pale, and a fine layer of dust covered him, but otherwise he was in perfect condition. He lay with his arms crossed, and one could almost believe he was sleeping. In his left hand, he held a metal orb, about the size of a grapefruit, covered with lines and strange symbols. In the other, he clutched what appeared to be a necklace of some sort, though this was a guess as his hand obscured whatever the thin silver chain was connected to. Other than these two items, he only wore a thin, gray funeral robe.Now, Harlen is not incredibly disposed to grave robbing. In fact, he rather abhors the practice. However, in this case, he felt he could justify it as \"excavation\", as these objects would likely never see the light of day again if he didn't take them, and they must have been important to have such strong protection. Standing as far away from the coffin as he could while still being able to reach in, he closed his hands around the objects. Nothing happened. Not yet. He pulled on both slowly and at the same time. The moment they left the corpse's hands, it sat up straight, and Harlen was flung against a nearby wall, feeling himself bruise and maybe crack a rib, but still holding the objects. The corpse let out a scream that could quite literally wake the dead, and was undoubtedly heard throughout the catacombs. As it screamed, it seemed to deteriorate before Harlen's eyes, becoming old and withered, then losing all of its flesh and hair, and finally disintegrating into dust. The room rumbled around him, and water flooded in through the hole in the wall. As it quickly flooded the room, Harlen swore he saw ghostly faces coming towards him from the wall, and the screams of lost souls filled his mind. For a moment, everything went dark as he float in the black, cold waters.Only a moment later did Harlen regain consciousness. His lungs burned for air, and he had already swallowed some sea water. He scrambled in the darkness, swimming in any direction looking for the hole in the wall. Luckily, in his search, he found his cane, and barely managed to pick it up. Using it as a guide, he found the hole, and swam as quickly as he could out into the passage and up the flooded stairwell. When he breached the water, he promptly emptied a lung full of water, as well as what little dinner he had eaten. He lay down in the darkness, with no ghost light to illuminate the room, and struggled for air. His rest was interrupted, however, when he heard the distant wailing of spirits from deeper in the catacombs. Sitting up, he felt around on the floor for his jacket and pack, which he had luckily left out of reach of the water. He stuffed the orb and necklace into his bag, and cast what he could remember of the ghost light spell. What appeared was hardly as well formed as his previous one, and it flickered like a candle in the wind, but it would do. He retraced his steps as best as he could, and eventually found the castle stairwell after a few wrong turns. Climbing it up and out, he found the sun was already rising over New Brimiarde. He was cold, damp, and in a great deal of pain, but he was alive. For once actually using his cane for support, he began his walk back to the inn.<Exit to The Jovial Jester Inn>", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Harlen leaned against a wall, panting.
