Deep within a tropical jungle on the southwestern portion of the continent, what was once an Elvish city that was the height of technology and sophistication has fallen into disrepair, slowly being overtaken by the jungle around it.The Elves who remain there are a suspicious and often hateful lot, who cast out Ynalae for her hair color, believing her to be the Cursed Queen that would one day marry a Great Warrior, and destroy them all.

At the side of her new husband Kellam, the Last King of his tribe, she stands as the Last Queen, meant to lead his people - their people - to glory.

The spear took him in the chest, piercing his heart; he gurgled, a strangled sound, and slumped to his knees. He looked up at Kellam with eyes growing glassy with death, then managed to look over at Ynalae with an expression of pure venom. Then he collapsed to the ground and proceeded to rapidly bleed out. There were many cries of dismay from the crowd, but more than that, there were whispers of disbelief. This golden-haired Elf had slain their chieftain, and was fulfilling the prophecy. Would they be next?<br><br/>Lae simply smiled, looking proud, and stepped down into the arena. Crossing to where Kel stood, she gathered energy into the odd stone blade of her spear, which flared with golden fire; this fire was touched to the fallen body of Ivsaar, quickly enveloping it. It would burn for some time before becoming ash, but the display of power had its purpose more in showing these people who their new leaders were, than in anything else. Taking Kel's hand, she raised it overhead and called out to the people. <font color=\"666600\">\"This man is the Great Warrior of legend - but I am no Cursed Queen. I am his wife, the Last Queen to his Last King, the prophesied leaders foretold to bring glory to a people once divided, now reunited at last. These people are <i>you</i>.
