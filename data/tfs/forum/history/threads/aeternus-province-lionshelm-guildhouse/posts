TheHall is expansive with high ceilings of stone and wide, smooth walls vauntingnumerous torches and paintings. The first chamber, the Atrium, is about seventyfeet wide and forty feet inward \u2013 a capacious room filled with virgin-timbertables and chairs, a bar, an impressive stretch of shelving (some of which isoccupied by various bottles and potions; tomes and grimoires); a chandeliermade of indistinguishable bones (save for what seemed indubitably like thecrest of a pelvis), and stone stairs that led up into the private quarters. Inaddition, an arched double doorway led into a large room with a long diningtable, two weapon racks, and various trophies attached to the walls. Note: Reaching the Guildhouse can be a struggle unless familiar with the path -- three sides of the establishment are steep drop-offs with jagged, rocky sides. From afar, it looks isolated. Within the main room, the Atrium -- there is a large bulletin board that has scraps of parchment pinned to its marred surface -- usually whatever is posted in Aeternus Quests will also be on this board.Outside the Guildhouse is a modest stable usually withseveral tethered horses, and a gated iron fence. Titanic accumulations of rockswere stacked off to the right, the result of such a large area being carved out\u2013 however, an already large proportion had been used to build the Walls aroundAeternus. To the east of the stables is a wide-open field with perpetually-changing obstacles and a range set up for archery.[Upstairs/Private Chambers]: Reserved for the Lionshelm Gentry.[Current Occupants: 20]", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/board/32/aeternus-quests"], "image_list": ["http://41.media.tumblr.com/3637d99e28fa8c7d66e2de242139a860/tumblr_mhjuybECId1ry5naio1_1280.jpg"], "html": "<div align=\"right\"><font color=\"1979e6\"><u><font face=\"georgia\" size=\"4\"><b>Lionshelm Guildhouse</b></font></u></font></div>"}}
