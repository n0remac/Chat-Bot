I thought and meditated and formed Starman into how he looks now. So yeah, I gained Starman through training, I created him. Hm... though there is more to that I hypothesize. I have a theory if you'll entertain it.\"Doobie leaned on a rail and thought up his theory to what a Stand is, which included a story of his origins, \"You see, before I ever had magical powers I was but a mundane Kobold, stupid and incapable of the simplest of magicks. I was in the barren fields of the Moorlands, hoping to find some food to bring home to my family, I was not the best hunter so I usually found things that were already dead. The sun was high in the sky, the heat was sweltering and I was about to call it quits and head home, but I saw something in the distance and scampered over to it. Well, what I found was a magician of some sort, he was dying of thirst and the sun had poisoned him to the point that he could no longer move. I came to the mage as his last few breaths released, there was nothing to do about it, he was a goner. As his life was extinguished however, I saw something leave his body, like a puff of golden smoke, it billowed out of him and created a form similar to the mage. I came over and touched the body to start searching it for stuff, and I was struck with a force of magic! The magicians magic had transferred into my own body, I imediately gained intelligence and aptitude. Once I came to my senses and got up I coughed and the golden smoke came out. I believe the Magicians soul decided to stick with me since I had inherited its magic, like its life's work could continue through me, and it has. I took all of the Mage's things, his books and scrolls, and I studied every night becoming more intelligent and I trained until I was the Kobold you see before you today.\"Doobie sighs, it had been a few years since he saw that Mage's dead body. He'd been thinking for a long time about the golden smoke, and he had realized recently that he absorbed the man's essence and soul. \"I believe that the soul of the dead mage is Starman, given a new form. We work together like brothers for mutual survival. I theorize that all Stand's are made from the souls of the dead, transformed by the mingling with our own souls inside our bodies.
