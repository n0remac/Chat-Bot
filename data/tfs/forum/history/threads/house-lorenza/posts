Once home to the Lorenza family, a group of warriors and knights, they rose to the rank of nobility in Brimiarde generations ago. For a while, they were respected and even adored. But as generations passed, they more gluttonous and corrupt, using their nobility to bleed the town and its harbor dry. Now it is the home of Tanner Lorenza, a professional drunkard and jackass. His parents and siblings have died of various causes, usually their own excessive life style. The building is in poor condition, falling apart and even collapsed in some areas, but Tanner still has wealth hidden somewhere in it, and only he goes in or out of its doors.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/ef/5d/12/ef5d129769942696f09693ee790a2437.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"The facade of the home.\" src=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/ef/5d/12/ef5d129769942696f09693ee790a2437.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/></div>"}, "post-3475": {"user": "The Mirage Tower", "user_num": 305, "timestamp": "1433281031000", "message": "Tanner ran through the front door of his home, out of breath. He paused for a moment, not knowing if the girl was behind him, trying to catch his breath. His alcohol-addled brain attempted to process the information he had. My father warned me. He said, \"Tanner, there's going to be a day when you gotta pay the price for your lifestyle.\" I thought he meant my tab! Pulling himself up, he worked his way inside and climbed the rotting staircase to the upper bedrooms. The boards creaked and bent as he walked, hardly able to support his weight. In his room, he looked above the mantle. There sat the Helm of Damian Lorenza, the founder of his family. While everything around it was rotting away beneath itself, the helm's steel still glistened in the moonlight.His father had made it very clear to him when he was younger. Even with all the damage to his brain his drinking had done, he could remember when he was very young, and his father sat him down in front of the helm. \"It doesn't matter if you lose our fortunes. Fortunes are made to won again. It doesn't matter if you soil our name. A name can be cleaned and repurposed, just as any other tool can. But this helm is our family's pride, and you cannot replace that, no matter how hard you try.\" His father had stared into the helmet for several minutes after that, filling the room with silence. \"My father told me, and his father before him, that someone would come to take this from us. They will come bearing a feather upon their forearm, and claim that my ancestors bargained with them for their nobility. But that is lies! I know my family, and to imply that they did not earn that title themselves should be treason. If I could, I would sever the tongues of anyone who dared speak of it... If you see that person in your lifetime, you cut them down like the swine they are. Protect the pride of House Lorenza, son. That is your one duty.\"Drawn back to the present by the sound of something in his house, Tanner gulped and grabbed the helmet. He wasn't certain if what his father said was true or not, but he didn't want to risk it. Besides, if they took the helmet, they would surely just come back for more til he had nothing! He donned the helmet, and a bright aura shone around him. His body was then covered in a bright steel set of armor, and in his hand was a broad shield with his family crest on it. \"For House Lorenza!\" He screamed as he barreled back through the halls and down the stairs, hoping to hit whoever was chasing him.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Tanner ran through the front door of his home, out of breath.

Well, as nostalgic as memories from... what, less than an hour ago? could be.No one had come out for a while now, and Rose was beginning to wonder if she'd have to burn down the house in order to attract Tanner's attention. With the terrible condition of the house, it probably wouldn't be too hard to soak some of the exposed wood and paneling in oil and light it on fire.But, no, public arson would probably have to be a last resort option, considering that she was in a city and there was sure to be guards nearby. Besides, she had burned down her village recently, and perhaps this wouldn't be the best time to drudge up those memories.After one last shout, Rose finally gave up on negotiating. The door seemed pretty flimsy, and she was sure she would be able to break in. \"Hey, if you're there, I'm coming i\u2014\"And then the fat, burly man in a set of shining armor and a shield strapped to his arm barreled out of the door, slamming into Rose and sending her flying.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Rose felt a sense of nostalgia as she stood outside of the house, shouting and asking if Tanner was there.

It had remained flat to her back, giving her nothing more than a minor bruise on her back from where the handle had been slammed against it when she impacted the ground.And on a related note, Rose's entire chest and torso felt like a mass of hurt. Considering her dulled sense of pain, she wouldn't be surprised if her ribs were cracked or even broken. Well, at least nothing more important had been broken, like her hips, spine or skull.With a grunt of pain, she sat up and hefted her scythe, the length of it slightly unwieldy due to her sitting position, and watched the man bawl his eyes out as he swung blindly into the air with... a shield?What.Rose groaned and slowly got to her feet, using her scythe as support. It would be a ridiculous if she had to tell Ignatius that a man with nothing but a shield had foiled her attempts at taking the enchanted helm.Ah, right, the glowing helmet. That was probably what Tanner was wearing, considering the obviously magical set of armor that he had equipped. She needed to find some way of getting it off of him, preferably without killing him. Although, from what Ignatius told her, getting rid of the man would probably be quite a boon for society in general, not to mention the way he had solicited Rose.Bleh. Killing could come later, after all of the non-lethal methods had been attempted.With that in mind, Rose pulled out a bit of jerky and shoved it into her mouth, chewing and wishing her body would heal faster even as she snuck up to the blindly flailing man.

In his addled state, he had exactly enough time to think Wait, oh shit, that's not good... before the blade was pulled back. Thanks to the armor, it wasn't able to cut into his shin, but with a little bit of force, it easily sent him face first into the ground. As he collided with the hard earth, he let out a mix of a groan and a sob. What little energy he had to begin with was waning quickly between supporting the armor he wore and his wild outbursts. He struggled to lift himself up a few times, but each time his arms gave out under him. It wasn't long until he gave up, laying still with his face in the dirt.For a while, he cried quietly, the sound of his sobbing ringing in the helmet, but as it continued, it became slower and deeper, until eventually it was obvious.

It was a little hard due to his immense jowls, but after a bit of elbow grease the enchanted helm came off, with neither the item nor the man worse for the wear.It was oh-so-tempting to leave the man sleeping drunkenly, but never let it be said that Rose left someone to suffocate in mud on the streets. Or something like that.Strapping her scythe onto her back once more, Rose began the arduous process of dragging the fat man back into house. The door was barely hanging onto its hinge, the lock splintered from the force the man had charged outside with. Her ribs ached in protest, but she dealt with the pain by shoving more jerky into her mouth.It took quite a long time for her to drag Tanner back into his house, but she finally managed to do it after some creative use of the slime and wet debris on the road to aid in his sliding. After flipping the man right-side-up and making sure that he was still breathing, she looked around for something to leave a message on. Nope, no paper or pen in sight. She didn't want to be here when he woke up, so she resorted to painstakingly carving a message into the rotting wall.\"SORRY. IT WAS EITHER THE HELM OR YOUR SOUL. ALSO, I'M UNDERAGE AND YOU HAVE GRAY HAIR. WHY WOULD YOU ASK ME OUT? THAT'S WEIRD.\"After leaving a slightly longer than intended message, Rose grabbed the helmet and shut the door as much as she could manage, then began her trek back to the mirror portal. She didn't want to be there when he woke up, and she really didn't want to be there after her little act of vandalism.Rose made her way directly back to the portal, checking her wrist to see the black jackal mark appear as she neared the magical mirror before stepping through.<Exit to Mirage Tower>", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Once again, Rose was completely baffled by Tanner's behavior."}, "post-3504": {"user": "Bryn", "user_num": 290, "timestamp": "1433296203000", "message": "When Bryn finally arrived at the House Lorenza, faint washes of nostalgia flowed over him.
