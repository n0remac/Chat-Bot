He and his crew had been at sea for the best part of a year now. The well stocked larder of the \"Curious Cutterfish\" was starting to run low with the crew living off stale crackers and moulded oranges. Tempers were short and the seamen were at the ends of their wits. The atmosphere on the ship quickly changed as the crew all piled above deck to get a glance at, what was unbeknownst to them, New Brimiarde. The thirty or so men stood open mouthed under the burning orange sails, the Solarian iconography branded proudly upon it. \"What am I looking at\u00a0Publius?\" The captain turned to the man beside him, his long brown coat rippling elegantly in the light breeze.\u00a0\"I.... I don't know Sir. We have no Charts that lead this far west.\" The small man beside him whimpered, handfuls of charters and maps in his hands which he proceeded to drop clumsily before scrambling along the deck to retrieve them.\u00a0Captain Adephhius sighed deeply, his hands reaching down for his looking glass which is hastily whipped out. Scanning the coast line he noticed the makings of a port town flying a green flag. \"Civilization?\" he muttered to himself puzzled. \"Take arms men and set anchor. Whoever or whatever is out there is likely to intercept us on our way to land. Be vigilant and be ready on my word.\"\u00a0The crew began to scurry around the ship loading the three ballistae on either side and gathering their cutlasses and bows. The light breeze gave way to a drizzle, with rain appearing in a blanket of mist slowly soaking the Solarian crew's clothing and skin.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.picresize.com/images/2015/05/29/1G8vl.jpg"], "html": "<b><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://i.picresize.com/images/2015/05/29/1G8vl.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/><br><br/>\"Land Ahoy!\"</br></b>"}, "post-3179": {"user": "USQUE AR HARA", "user_num": 85, "timestamp": "1432909111000", "message": "From the harbor, the guards spotted the new and unfamiliar ship that was off in the distance.

Hold you bows gentlemen. Whatever happens you are not to show any aggression unless I give the signal.\" The captain was tense. He was well aware that whatever happened here could shape the future relationship between the Solarian Assembly and the human populace on shore. The sound of rattling chains cut through the tension like a knife as the anchor was hauled up from the sea floor. The ship turned towards the port town and, with the wind in it's sails, began it's approach with Captain Adepphius taking a spot at the head of the ship to get the best view possible on proceedings.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Captain Adepphius paced nervously about the ship, still clutching the spyglass in his hand.

A flock of seagulls seemed to hover above, following them as if a flying bestial escort. The captain didn't move from his position at the nose of the vessel, one leg up on the stout wooden railings, the other planted firmly on the decking. This was to be the first sight the people of\u00a0New Brimiarde and indeed the entirety of the Kingdom of Medan would see of the Solarian Assembly; An old weathered man, unkempt and unwashed, stood firmly at the front of his well manned, well armed ship of orange sails, the crest of Solaa shining brightly against the dreary sky.\u00a0Adepphius, upon noticing the hushed whispers of the many people who had come to witness their landing, darted his head around his crew letting out whispered words of reassurance \"Steady now. Steady now\". The Curious Cutterfish glided gracefully into the docks, it's crew looking at Captain Adepphius for orders under baited breaths. \"Tie us up you sea dogs, make it neat and make haste\" Adepphius had come to a rather superficial, risky conclusion on first site of the people of New Brimiarde. He concluded that this was atleast a civilized society and the fact they had not mustered troops or sent a ship or three to intercept meant they must be open to peaceful relations, or slow to react.\u00a0The men quickly went about their duties clearly shaken and nervous at the whole situation. This was what they had signed up for when they joined the exploration and scout specialzed 22nd Centuria and most managed to cope admirably. In no time the vessel was securely fastened into a stationary position against the docks and with a slight motion of his head, the Solarian crew were back aboard the ship. In an attempt to come across as courteous and respectful, Adepphius stood at the top of the boarding plank, which had been lowered previously. His men, stood in line at attention, were behind him awaiting permission to come ashore.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The next few minutes was spent in dead silence, the crew of the Curious Cutterfish too stunned with anticipation and nerves to allow words to form on their lips.

The rain continued to fall in a light drizzle but at this point the Solarians had all but forgotten, intrigued with this foreign land. \"Have the men rest up in beds that don't move during the night, restock then return to Solaa's arms.
