You're not a very good entertainer, Ms. Runaway. Everyone has stories! Is that why you ran away? You were such an awful entertainer that you couldn't bare to face the shame any longer?\"The sculptor rose from his seat, annoyed.\"Hey, leave her alone! Don't just barge in and talk to her like that!\"The salesman's head swiveled around with an awful snap, twisting 180 degrees to stare directly back at the sculptor.\"Was I talking to you, stone carver? I don't think I was. Sure would be a shame if one of these wraith bottles were to break, wouldn't it?\"Turning his head back towards Zrixiana, he continued.\"What can you do, then? Do you juggle? I do so love jugglers, especially the ones with knives and fire. Are you a musical snake? Sing me a song! Do something, at least. You're awfully boring, just sitting there and shivering. Are you cold? How could you be cold, look at the fire!\"In the fireplace, a huge fire roared.

The ache of the cold was starting to ebb away again. Her hands steadily rubbed at her arms, trying to regain some feeling in them.

There was very clearly no way for it to fit in his pocket, but he didn't seem to care about this blatant disregard for the laws of physics.
