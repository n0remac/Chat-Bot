Should Ulfang's champion lose the duel to first blood, however, he would have to withdraw his troops under a ceasefire agreement for a minimum of six months.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was Dantess himself who rode to meet the challenger this day. It would become apparent by rumor from some of the Goraian attendees that he fashioned himself the greatest Swordsman in all of Goraia. Clad in dark Goraian regalia, his athletic build at six feet tall trailed a billowing crimson cape attached to his left shoulder and presented a highly ceremonial appearance, silver aiguillette on his right attached to an ornate martingale that streamed to the swept hilt of his already-drawn cut-and-thrust side-sword. He stood tall, proud and with a grand smile, his immaculate but spiked black hair lending to a handsome and iconic appearance, blade held low in his right hand and his right boot already forward. From here it was easy to dip into a respectful bow as his opponent arrived and took his stance, and he would be prepared to begin.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ah, welcome,\" he said invitingly. \"Shall we begin?\"", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/169/post-first-eastern-border-crossing?page=4"], "image_list": [], "html": "<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>"}, "post-26395": {"user": "The Black Vale", "user_num": 1147, "timestamp": "1456795462000", "message": "The champion of Ulfang could soon be seen approaching upon a black as night destrier.

The blade slid out silently, making no more noise than it's wielder was known to make.\u00a0Ser Avald only fancied himself as a knight, doing his own duty. In this way he was comparatively simple, compared to his opponent who stood before him. His clothing also reflected the man's values, values of simplicity, of effectiveness. Ser Avald came to this bout wearing a brown leather tunic and black leather breeches.There were certain qualities however that made this man stand out nonetheless. He stood at 6'8'' tall, and had the well built body of a swordsman to match it. His actual skill with a sword would be mostly unknown to the Goraians in attendance however, but as he slid into his opening stance, right flank presented to his opponent as he drew his legs apart to stand with them positioned astride from each other, they would conclude he had at least some aptitude. His forward foot, his right foot, was pointed in the direction he was facing while his rear foot was positioned perpendicular, about a shoulder's distance apart. He soon widened this stance however and lowered it, his sword sliding downwards slightly as well into a position where his pommel was positioned on the inside of his right knee and the point of the blade was pointed toward's his opponents chest.\u00a0Ser Avald would incline his head slightly to indicate he was ready to begin the duel.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The champion of Ulfang could soon be seen approaching upon a black as night destrier.

His calculated steps forward bespoke an incredible amount of practice in footwork, and he spared no hesitation in going for the first blow.

Continuing with the inertia of his initial thrust, his arm now whipped the sword upwards. As Avald's weapon finished transitioning and struck its mark with a light clink, Dantess was bringing the weapon slashing up at Avald's face wildly, so that it built up pressure in its tip against the intervening blade and subsequently whipped through the air with an audible swish, threatening first-blood in what seemed to be the timing of lightning. His forward lunge motion canted his body in towards its mark, to further assure the threat of his sword's quivering point.

However, due to the stakes at bay, such a pursuit in the name of itself was foolhardy. He opted for a sort of compromise to his dilemma; as Avald rose his blade into a sort of\u00a0hanging guard, the Goraian swordsman lashed his downwards, disengaging his sword with the same proverbial flow of his weapon's overarching flick. For a brief fraction of a second, both combatants would be disengaged due to their opposing steps from one another, due to the very grace with which Avald had executed his defense. This left Dantess' neck as a target, and just as the opponent went for it, he was ducking down to the ground, his left hand emerging from its cape to brace its palm hard against the soft dirt below. On two legs and a palm, Dantess was reached as far forward as humanly possible to assure he could not evade, slipping deviously beneath the angle of Avald's counter-attack in less than a breath's time. Properly executed, the passata sotto was one of the fastest ripostes available, as his blade struck out at Avald's exposed midsection in parallel angle to his sword in nearly the same timing, its angle slated to slip between a pair of ribs had its full force not been pulled to allow only a minor bloody laceration.\u00a0 \u00a0 And yet, should his sword strike true in that moment, Dantess would still proceed to stand, reassuming his stance with a fiery gaze of passion. His heart pounded, as these very few passes had been enough to say this was a fight he might enjoy over and over again, should the opponent agree for the sake of gallantry, honor, and past-time.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"..Again.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>"}, "post-26549": {"user": "The Black Vale", "user_num": 1147, "timestamp": "1456859085000", "message": "Avald had not committed to his previous thrust as much as he had intended as the two fighters had stepped away from each other.

The speed of Dantess's thrust did not allowed Avald to bring his own sword down in time to defend, but he had another option available to him. As he twisted his body sideways his left hand would reach down and in one deft motion grab the metal scabbard that hung loosely from his left hip and knock the thrusted side-sword even farther off it's intended mark. Avald would do this with considerable force to knock the blade quite a bit out of harm's way.In the same motion that Avald twisted to avoid the thrusted blade as well as knock it aside with the scabbard in his left hand, he would spin past the knocked aside lunged blade and lunge forward past Dantess's outstretched arm.

The point of his sword was guided gently aside by the devious last-ditch defense employed in the form of the scabbard, crossing before the dread knight's contorted body even as Dantess continued his mad dash to safety in the form of a forwards stance recovery. With Avald's left shoulder to the fore and the angle of his body slimmed, Dantess shoved off the ground with the aid of his palm in a forwards dash as his sword dipped forward with the nature of his motion. For a brief moment, as Avald turned his back into Dantess' next forwards step, the scabbard had become the fulcrum to Dantess' sword, which had become like a lever against the defense employed for his previous low strike. As Dantess moved forwards behind Avald's left shoulder and the dread knight completed his turn, the twisting synergy of their complementary movements would serve to forcibly disengage the two blades, the foible of Dantess' sword slipping beyond the scabbard for a draw-cut along his opponent's lower back as he practically danced, with two nimble hops, forwards and out of range.
