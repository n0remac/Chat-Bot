It had been while searching for random pockets of lust and pheromones (always a good place to grab a quick snack) that she zeroed in upon a particularly potent one, fraught with both holy and evil energies. As she focused her demonic scrying orb, she happened upon a most interesting sight.. a blonde mostly-naked female angel, flying away from a forest. Intrigued, she moved in closer, and saw a demon sitting upon a rock.The description matched the one she'd been given for Samael, and Cahryss was pleased by her good luck. Not to mention impressed that this veritable unknown had managed to nail an angel - and quite well, if the pheromones hovering about were any indication. Opening a rip in space-time between Hellscape and the Overworld, the Demonlady stepped through, allowing the portal to close behind her as she walked toward the male, a sway in her hips.

It had taken little digging in the Hellscape information network to get a name, but finding him.. well, that had been tricky, as no one actually had a fix on his demonic energy or his last location. It had been while searching for random pockets of lust and pheromones (always a good place to grab a quick snack) that she zeroed in upon a particularly potent one, fraught with both holy and evil energies. As she focused her demonic scrying orb, she happened upon a most interesting sight.. a blonde mostly-naked female angel, flying away from a forest. Intrigued, she moved in closer, and saw a demon sitting upon a rock.<br><br/>The description matched the one she'd been given for Samael, and Cahryss was pleased by her good luck. Not to mention impressed that this veritable unknown had managed to nail an angel - and quite well, if the pheromones hovering about were any indication. Opening a rip in space-time between Hellscape and the Overworld, the Demonlady stepped through, allowing the portal to close behind her as she walked toward the male, a sway in her hips. No need to hide behind her mortal facade - she stood there in all her bare-skinned, tentacled glory, offering him a smirk. <font color=\"cc0066\">\"Well well, imagine the luck!

He shakes his head a few more times, looking about for the remnants of his clothes. He's at least managed to have some variation of pants on, and was working on his tunic when he felt a massive disturbance of unholy energy permeating the air. Immediately stopping what he was doing, his right hand extends upward, gathering demonic taint as it forms into the massive great-sword he typically possessed for the more serious of combat situations. His rage magnified at the audacity of someone coming for him, and his blackened heart is racing.  Was this the very same Demon he was gunning after, and to remove their crown for his own head?

His eyes slowly wander along their true form as they've opted to approach him, though he holds his blade out to halt their advances. This could easily be a trap invoked by the current Pride King, and he couldn't afford to be ensnared.

He's no fool - he can sense her immense power, and if he were to be honest with himself, he's almost fearful of what her purpose here is. Perhaps that's why he hastily added the last part to his statement, tightening his grip upon his blade as he harnesses demonic energy from around the area.\u00a0\u00a0His hair sways wildly, and the void-like pupils that are painted black stare upon this woman's true form in both awe, and grudging respect...and a bit of something else, that he can't quite place his finger on..among other things.\u00a0 ", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Lost in the treacherous thoughts that besieged his mind, Samael was contemplating on what to do with himself at this point.
