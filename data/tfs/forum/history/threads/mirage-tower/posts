Some speculated that it was simply an incredibly unsafe location to build, while others claimed that the god who the cathedral honored had become dissatisfied with his followers. One worker even claimed to have seen a vision of their god, beckoning him over the edge. Regardless of the truth, the building remained empty for many years, occasionally housing vermin and local fauna.Now the tower is under the ownership of Ignatius Bellefonte Delatoi, an enterprising daemon notorious for openly making deals with the other inhabitants of the realm, and the strict enforcement of these deals. He simply stumbled upon the tower during his travels, and discovered that the area was highly susceptible to illusionary magic. He spent years and decades enchanting the tower and bolstering the natural magic of the area, creating what is now known as the Mirage Tower, his personal offices. To those who do not know about Delatoi, the tower appears as a hazy image from the top of the opposite cliff face, but venturing closer causes the tower to simply seem to disappear into the cliff face. Most assume it a mirage, and that is exactly what Delatoi wants. Inside reside his personal offices and collection of artifacts, protected by magic and... other defenses.Entering the Mirage Tower is a challenge by itself. Besides being unable to see it from outside its walls, there is no direct stairway or passage into the tower. The wooden stairs the workers used during construction rotted away over a century ago, and the passage inside the mountain has collapsed. The easiest way in would be a Mirage Mirror. Appearing as a floor-to-ceiling mirror surrounded by black iron and a jackal head at the top, the mirror holds a latent magic that activates when a password is given. Close to a century ago, an issue occurred that resulted in most of the mirrors going dormant, requiring Ignatius himself to seek them out.Active Mirage MirrorsNew Brimiarde Mirror (Old Storefront in the Harbor)", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/cb/ce/a0/cbcea06408d5914d14ee7ee1f3ec44d2.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"The Mirage Tower, as viewed from a distance\" src=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/cb/ce/a0/cbcea06408d5914d14ee7ee1f3ec44d2.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/><br><br/></br></div>"}, "post-3333": {"user": "Ignatius Delatoi", "user_num": 158, "timestamp": "1433192371000", "message": "Stepping through the mirror, Ignatius was greeted with an empty, dusty room filled with dull mirrors, all circled about the center of the room. The only light came from the mirror behind him. In the center of the room was a metal spiral staircase, extending up into the darkness. He began walking slowly, deliberately, up the stairs. With each step, the room seemed to come back to life a bit more. The dust seemed to be lifted from the staircase and the floor, floating into the air and disappearing, and old candle sconces along the walls were lit, becoming brighter the higher Ignatius travelled. By the time he reached the top of stairs, the room looked polished and clean, though most of the mirrors still appeared dull and inactive.The stairway exited into a parlor-esque room, filled with fine furniture and art, all old and worn through the years, but still of excellent craftsmanship. The room was dark and musty, almost stifling with how much dust was in the air. He shook his head solemnly. I mean really... I'm gone for a few centuries, and the whole place is falling apart. As he thought this, the room began cleaning itself, much like the mirror hub. At least that still is working. Wish I didn't have to be here for it to do that, but better than nothing. He pushed his way through a large pair of ornate mahogany doors, working his way to his private offices and vault.His offices, in contrast to the rest of the tower, were impeccably clean and in exactly the same condition he had left them in. The room was composed of one large writing desk, surrounded by shelves filled with volumes of strange books and old contracts. Towards the back was a simple black wooden door. The vault. His personal depository of magic items and relics. He breathed a sigh of relief at the sight. It had been centuries since he had the energy to overcome his own magical defenses to re-enter the tower, and thus centuries since he had last seen his pride and joy. He passed the desk, lightly rustling the papers that sat on them, and went to the door. Placing his hand on the handle, it burned infernally, singeing his hand, but he continued to grin. The lock was always painful, but nothing he couldn't handle, and an incredibly powerful spell that made sure only he could open it. When it seemed like the metal would burn through his entire hand, the door swung open, revealing the large underground chamber beyond.The vault was filled with magical oddities and wonders, organized by Ignatius' chaotic method of categorization. But at the back stood his pride. From a distance, it appeared to be a relatively normal statue of an angelic being, wings spread wide and arms outstretched in a welcoming embrace. Upon closer inspection, it was far from ordinary, however. The statue itself was close to three stories tall, made of a solid piece of marble with veins of gold passing through. The wings, however, were actual feathers, interlocking and secured into place with fine, silk like filament. The wings were not fully formed yet, patches still missing along the frame, and the feathers were not uniform in color. Some were a bright, celestial white while others were night void black, while more were a gray between the two. When the wind rustled them, whispers could be heard in the air. The face of the angel was also odd, twisted and malformed, so that wherever you stood, you saw a different face with a different expression. Reaching beneath his jacket, Ignatius pulled out a bundle of feathers, including the one drawn from the young soldier in the plains. Time to meet your new home. He began the slow, methodic task of attaching the feathers as the tower slowly hummed to life around him. There was much work to do to restore himself and his tower to their former glory.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Stepping through the mirror, Ignatius was greeted with an empty, dusty room filled with dull mirrors, all circled about the center of the room.

He grinned as he looked around. His offices appeared polished and new, so his magic was still doing its job. Of course, his offices were only one part of the many sections of the tower, and there were still many rooms to be examined. He decided to start with the apex of the tower, and work his way down. Picking up a few old contracts from his desk to read on the way, he passed back through the parlor, and turned towards the grand stairwell.As he walked, the tower appeared to be in good shape. The stone of the giant circular stairwell that rose through his tower was polished and uncracked, and brief glances through the doors and hallways showed good progress on the cleaning. Not only that, but he had found some rather interesting contracts with members of the Solaris family that he had quite forgotten about. He'd have to look up if they were still around. He finished his reading as he reached the top of the tower, where there was a second black door, this one made of the same iron that framed his mirrors. He placed his hand on the door, which had no handle, and waited for the familiar thrum of magic he remembered. He was admittedly a little worried about this room: He didn't allow the magic that kept the tower clean into this room due to the sensitive nature of its contents, much like the vault, but lacked some of the protections of the latter. If anything were wrong, it would be in there. It took a few more moments for the door to activate, which wasn't a good sign, but it did eventually creak open.The room was relatively dark, as he had long bricked up the window to this room for security reasons. However, the room should have been one of the liveliest of the tower. It held most of the magical enchantments that protected the tower, with the exception of his vault which had its own. Normally, runes and symbols glowed and moved, keeping things running smoothly. However, from what he could see, only the mirage around the tower and his maintenance spell were active, and even they glowed weakly in comparison to their original shine. To get the tower back to its full glory, he'd have to re-imbue all of the runes. He paused. If I do this, it will remove the mirage until it's finished. But that should only take a day or two. And I can handle what pests may try to upset me. He sighed. This wasn't going to be fun. And he adored fun. Picking up a nearby chisel, he drove it into the central rune. The whole tower shook, and the other runes faded as the magic that passed through most of the tower was interrupted. When it settled, he began his work of recarving the large circle of runes and glyphs.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Ignatius walked out of the vault, boots clacking on the floor as the black door closed silently behind him.

When she was on the opposite cliff, there had been a hazy image of something there, but it had disappeared after she had painstakingly climbed back down and approached the other cliff.And now it had reappeared, only this time in its full glory instead of a mirage. The front of the building was decorated with stained glass windows, and there were smaller sections that split off into towers. The cathedral was clearly only half-finished, but she could envision the majestic structure it would have been if it were completed.The clearly magical, reappearing structure was too much of a temptation. Rose grinned and pulled out a pair of thick, black gloves from her pouch, then slipped them on. It was time to begin climbing.__________Okay, so maybe this wasn't the best idea.Rose looked down the sheer cliff face, her hands clutching the rocks jutting out in front of her. Despite not being tired\u2014due to her current state of undeadness\u2014the climb was still extremely difficult, her lack of upper body strength and relatively short reach working against her.Something under her left foot shifted. Rose quickly moved her foot to a new location as the rock underneath her boots crumbled away, tumbling down the cliff face until it disappeared into the distance. Swallowing nervously, she continued her climb at a slower pace, making sure to double check each of the handholds before using them.__________After what seemed like hours later, Rose hauled herself over the edge of the cliff, letting out a sigh of relief as she flopped over and brushed away the hair on her face that had been bothering her for the past few hours. She wasn't tired, but she could feel the damage the climb had done to her muscles and tendons, her body attempting and failing to repair the minor injuries.Taking out a bit of beef jerky from her pouch, Rose munched on the snack to supply the required nutrients for the mending process as she got up and surveyed her surroundings. It was night time by now, and everything seemed a little ominous. At first she thought her eyes were playing a trick on her in the dim light conditions, but as she walked up to the cathedral she realized that there was no main entrance. In fact, it was as though something had caved in on an underground portion of the cathedral.Looking up, Rose noticed that there was some light coming out from some of the stained glass windows. Perhaps the building wasn't as abandoned as she thought.In a brief moment of introspection, Rose realized that it wasn't like she could die again. Or maybe she could. Was she technically alive right now? Oh well. Climbing more didn't really appeal to her.Rose took a deep, non-vital breath, and shouted, \"Hey, is there anyone alive up there?\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Rose stared at the ruined cathedral that had suddenly appeared on the cliff face, her mouth hanging open in shock."}, "post-3438": {"user": "Ignatius Delatoi", "user_num": 158, "timestamp": "1433263922000", "message": "The tower sat silent, the light behind the windows flickering dimly in the darkness.

Fancy little title, isn't it? Thought it up myself. Now, to explain a few things to ease your transition. Firstly, that mark I gave you on your left palm, the jackal head, will stay there indefinitely. It will really only show up in my company or around one of the mirrors, but it won't actually disappear unless you leave my employment, for one reason or another. The other mark you now bear is a spell of my own creation. It is what I like to call my 'Contract Tracker'. Each contract you sign on will appear as a small strand stemming from the main line, and that small strand will glow when you are near the contract or the persons who signed it.\" He passed his hand near the mark, and the smaller line glowed a dim, sky blue. \"Get enough active contracts, and it forms a feather.\" He rolled up his right sleeve and showed the feather tattoo he had, which started at his wrist and wrapped up and around to his bicep. \"The mark is also how I will keep in contact. Watch.\" As he said this, Rose could actually feel the line shift and twist in her skin, forming the word \"Hello, Rose\". \"When the mark is like that, I can hear what you are saying, and can respond in short sentences. If you want to contact me, simply run a finger along the length of the line, and I may respond if I have the time.\" The line shifted back to its original form. \"As for magic and scythe instruction...\"He picked up the spellbook he had read from earlier, grabbed another smaller book from his desk, then went to the bookshelves once more. After a bit of searching, he pulled down a rather tattered old tome that looked like it was soaked in blood at some point in its history. Placing all three on the desk, he sat down in his chair and opened them all. The spellbook remained on the page containing a healing spell, the journal from his desk was blank, and the tattered tome was filled with diagrams of men fighting with farming scythes and commentary on their techniques. Taking out his personal pen, he began copying into the journal, his hand moving quickly and creating eerily accurate reproductions of the other two books. \"I'm putting a basic healing spell, as well as several key techniques for the scythe, in this journal.

Aristoph has since slipped off the mortal coil, with no kin to carry on his name. Luckily, his deal was simple, much like the Lorenza's. Aristoph owed me an amulet that I know for a fact he was buried with. Go to his gravesite, dig up the old stiff, and get back the amulet. Or if they cremated him, dump out his ashes and sift through them til you find it. No fire could burn that amulet down, so it's going to be there somewhere.\" He stopped suddenly.

Grinning, he turned to Rose, handing her the contract and the pen he always carried.\"Simply sign in the same place as you did before to accept the job.

It was a small business, managing many of the dockworkers and helping keep them organized, but it covered the mirror effectively and gave Ignatius a sense of who was entering the harbor at any given time. It also allowed Ignatius to use his few remaining contacts to send out the word: Ignatius Delatoi was back and ready to strike a deal. It was one mirror down, several more to go. Speaking of which, he currently had some business to attend to. Going down to the mirror hub of the tower, he stood and waited. If his calculations were right, Gallus Solaris should have reached the mines sometime during that day. He would wait for a few hours, and if nothing happened, he'd need to have a \"chat\" with Gallus about the matter of his family's debt. Luckily, after only an hour, the mirror to Ignatius's right began to hum to life. Excellent. It looks like there is hope for me yet in the Assembly.
