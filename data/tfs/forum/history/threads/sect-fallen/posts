Syralla's dark brown hair seemed to bleed into the purple of her robe and her equally dark brown eyes sat in a pale, but attractive face.

Walking briskly past the other two doors, she moved immediately to the window of Roy's cell. \"Ah, so you are here, Royal.\" She turned and nodded to an unseen youth who had been behind the four lightly armored men and he ran off back up the stairs. She turned back to the small barred window. \"I would apologize for the means by which you were brought here, but I doubt it would be of any consolation. Still, your reputation does you little credit. You are indeed little more than a child given the gift of an immortal, not quite the powerful wanderer that I had heard about.\"\u00a0 \u00a0She nodded to Taus, who then unlocked the large padlock on Roy's cell door. Drawing back the bolt, he pushed the door inward and open for Syralla. When she stepped into the room, Eloria would immediately notice the runes hidden in her robe (Roy might too). They would cast a small bubble of anti-magic around her person. If she got too close to where Eloria was hiding, she would definitely be exposed.\u00a0 \u00a0As the door swung open, the four lightly armored men would be seen to have crossbows all loaded with headless bolts. Roy, being a vampire, might recognize them as oak -- the perfect tool for killing him. After Syralla had moved fully into the room, Taus stood in the doorway, almost as imposing as the door itself.\u00a0 \u00a0\"My name is Syralla,\" she said to Roy. \"I will not pretend to be a host with your best interests in mind, though I have spared little expense to make your stay here as comfortable as possible. And though you might be intent on it, I would not try to escape presently were I you. As you can see, my robes are warded against your magic fireballs, and the men out there are all armed with crossbow loaded with oak stakes. And Taus here,\" she looks up at the grizzled man, \"is his own force.\"\u00a0 \u00a0\"Let me tell you why you are here Royal. You are going to help me bring my lord and master back into this world. Your vampiric healing will let you outlast any mortal for the ritual I need to perform, as copious amounts of blood will be needed. Don't worry though, I have several others from whom I will gather the fluid, so while your contribution might be great, it won't be singular,\" she says, laughing a little to herself.\u00a0 \u00a0\"Once my lord has been brought back into this realm, you will be free to go, should you survive.

Luckily for Roy, being knocked aside saved him from being crushed under the falling knight. He slumped against the wall, shaking his head to try to clear away the ringing in his ears.
