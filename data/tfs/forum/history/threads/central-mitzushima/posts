They were drowned out by the din of people and noise around her, but Miyuri could hear them just fine.\"You're right,\" she spoke softly and she took two easy and graceful steps away from the alley, closer to Hiyama, letting her hand smoothly cascade back down to her hip without ever having touched the grip of her tanto. It wasn't her job to protect the city, nor was it her job to protect its citizens. \"I never did think I'd make a good martyr,\" she said softly, a self-depreciating tone on her wry and humor-filled voice.She took a few more steps away from the alley and from the chaos that might happen, and when she didn't hear Hiyama's footfalls behind her, she turned, those incredible eyes of hers settled on the vague outline of him still in the shadows. Then, they glanced towards the young girl that seemed to be enthralled by the bogey man in the shadows, given the fear on her face and the reluctant steps she took towards the alley.For a moment, Miyuri wondered if she should act. Her heart seized as if she should, given the darkness there. But too many years of self-centered survival pushed the feeling aside, and her silver gaze once more slipped towards Hiyama. \"Are you coming?\" she asked him, her pretty head tipping a little with the question.\"Heh...its good you are not samurai.\"And with that he found himself following her, an absent minded departure from the scene in the same direction as her. Shed hear him behind him, a soft \"okay\" issuing to her question.\"Where were you headed?\"A smirk tipped the corner of her lips at his remark on samurai. No, she certainly was not a person that pretended to follow some moral code. She could still remember the look on a village woman's face when a samurai cut off her son's head for not bowing to the samurai low enough.Her back turned from the bogeyman in the alley way, and she made way into the buildings of the district that were not disrupted by darkness and crows, but seemed to exist in ignorance of any evilness in the world. It made it easy for Miyuri to forget the scene as well, with only a tinge of guilt at the fate of the two young women she had left to the fate of the alley way.\"I was looking for a place to stay,\" Miyuri spoke and let her silver-blue eyes trail towards him. He was young, and he seemed impressionable. \"Do you know of a bed I could lie in?\" she teased him, just because she could. And yet... her face turned just a little more, as if reluctantly glancing over her shoulder at the scene they were leaving behind...", "link_list": ["/post/14276/thread", "/user/192", "/post/14274/thread"], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/xSLDax2.png", "//storage.proboards.com/6046952/images/uCQvKjMwQCSfGa7d4dCT.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@hiyama\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/14276/thread\" timestamp=\"1445799406\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-192\" title=\"Hiyama\"><img alt=\"Hiyama Avatar\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/xSLDax2.png\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/14276/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1445799406000\" title=\"Oct 25, 2015 10:56:46 GMT -8\">Oct 25, 2015 10:56:46 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-192 group-0\" href=\"/user/192\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@hiyama\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Hiyama</span></a></span> said:</div><div author=\"@katsunaga\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/14274/thread\" timestamp=\"1445798573\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-0\" title=\"katsunaga\"><img alt=\"katsunaga Avatar\" src=\"//storage.proboards.com/6046952/images/uCQvKjMwQCSfGa7d4dCT.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/14274/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1445798573000\" title=\"Oct 25, 2015 10:42:53 GMT -8\">Oct 25, 2015 10:42:53 GMT -8</abbr></a>  @katsunaga said:</div>Her gaze didn't move from the proverbial 'bogey man' in the alley, but she felt the young man's presence near her and heard his softly spoken words.
