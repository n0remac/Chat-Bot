So, please post regularly and contact me if you cannot post for a period of time.Isao no Kakita, Hatamoto to Lord Hizashi Genji, summons several personages to the court of the reigning daimyo. The young samurai appears recovered from his wound and presents a regal bearing, his face stoic as he prepares to address the assembly.\"Several days ago a spirit possessing a warrior led a band of bandits and ronin to attack this estate,\" Isao explained. \"The attack was foiled; we exorcised and banished the spirit. Now I seek to see this spirit put to rest for good, might it never threaten my Lordship ever again.\"Isao nodded to the seven before him.\"If you vanquish this spirit and return with proof of its demise, you will be summarily rewarded for your service.\"A servant brought a chest into the court and Isao opened it, revealing a felt lined interior where seven sets of prayer beads rested. \"Each of you should take one, blessed as they are, so that the spirit will never seize you again,\" he spoke.\"Next I send you to a shrine dedicated to Ryu-jin, the god of wisdom. There a shrine maiden will bless your swords-\" Isao looked between the warriors, \"-so you can harm the creature in its realm.\"\"Afterwards beseech the rumored returned drsgon for the knowledge to travel between this realm and the next.
