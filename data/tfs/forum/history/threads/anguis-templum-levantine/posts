The site of the Temple was carefully thought out so that twice a year the rising sun illuminates the statues of the Sicariotes \u2013 the God Dragons. It could be argued that the entirety of Levantine was built around the placement of this temple, almost as an afterthought.Surrounding the temple\u2019s structure is a continuous porch formed by a row of columns surrounding the perimeter. Terraced gardens litter the peristyle, flowers and shrubs, fountains, benches, sculptures and a few fish ponds. The procession of its room and layout emphasizes order, symmetry, and monumentality; combined with geometric shapes with stylized organic motifs and draconic symbolism. Each room opens into the next, each one becoming dimmer and dimmer, banishing outside light entirely in the sanctuary. The Temple itself is divided into five sections, centered on an axis with a slight inclined from the sanctuary down to the temple entrance. On either side of the pylon entrance, two carbonatite obelisks stand with intricate carvings of serpents circling their height; at the top, a great dragon\u2019s maw. Past the entrance is a hypostyle hall, with then large columns on both sides and a stone roof, leading into an open anticum, permitting dim light from clerestory windows. The large columns are decorated with relief, gilded and inlaid with pieces of fluorite and colored glass. They contain calendars, depictions of rituals, and the texts of ancient hymns. Deeper into the Anguis Templum is the inner chambers and sanctuary. The inner chambers are public, but the sanctuary is not. Only individuals with a certain clearance, such as priests, oracles, or acolytes, can enter this sacred room. The inner chambers are dedicated as an offering hall, including several altars. Hexagonal slabs surmounting cylindrical bases, and various religious paraphernalia. In the sanctuary, a shrine made entirely of kimberlite with raw, serrated edges of virgin diamonds protruding out, sat at the very rear of the temple and the room itself is deep and narrow, devoid of all natural light. It is meant to symbolize the darkness before creation. A small but intricate statue of Anguis is centered on the altar.Deities Worshipped:MajorAnguis: The Mistress of All, Mother of Dragons, Cosmic SerpentCihuacoatl: Daughter of Anguis, bore human children, mixed with the blood of dragons.
