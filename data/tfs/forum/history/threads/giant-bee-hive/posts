It is nestled in heavily forested hills, far enough away from the Medani outpost so as not to be a direct threat to the settlement itself, but definitely makes travel, hunting, and camping in the region dangerous. Those exploring the area are advised to be cautious -- the giant bees have driven away most predators, but solitary trolls and gryphons have been spotted in the region.The bees roam the land in a ten mile radius of the hive, in a constant search for pollen and nectar, usually in groups of three to six, and typically do not attack unless threatened. The hive is said to be built in a cluster of ancient elm trees at the base of a great cliff, difficult by those that cannot fly or are not skilled climbers.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The giant bee hive is some twenty miles to the northwest of the colony of New Brimiarde.

Because of this, nowhere in his plan had he included some measure of stopping their indiscriminate destruction; indeed, such may have been part of the strategy.Their objective? To lure the massive Mulleres Centipede from its home in the depths during its feeding time, utilizing the Exousia's illusory spell to lure it to the location of the beehive with the guise of a human village blueprinted off of Wolfgang's own. The Mulleres Centipede, a magical beast of colossal proportions that crawled upon land in increments of eons, in order to consume the souls of land-based life, and it was Wolfgang's desire to lead it into an accidental triggering of the bee's attack hormones as it unknowingly intrudes upon their hive.The location couldn't have presented a better opportunity. Wolfgang stepped out of the dark cover of the woods upon an overlooking boulder that stood atop a breathtaking precipice. Over a hundred archers followed, peeking over the cliff one by one. Wolfgang had no need to climb down the cliff to the nest; such was the ill-fated centipede monster's stage, where an illusion spell designed to tickle all dimension of centipede and human qualia presented a village into which bees seemed to... vanish from existence. Cool, humid sea air blew through Wolfgang's blonde hair as he stood just outside the safe distance from their nest, awaiting the great creature.Energies welled as Wolfgang's arm rose, a concentration of power for a spell that caused the slightest of tangible disturbances to the oncoming gale...\"Come on... where are you... come on... I know you're in there...\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The band traveled in large numbers, wary of the numerous dangers present in these backwoods.
