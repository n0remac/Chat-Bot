The enemy has been vanquished, and the leader turned out to be Prince Harvold, who has just been beheaded. Feruzia was injured and is possibly dying, and they are relocating to the forest where the rest of the involved parties just were. They are no longer part of this thread, but their actions were most certainly observable and are part of the Verri storyline.Rien/Maelik/Cassius \u2013 Are part of the \u201cLast Monarch\u201d quest, have just arrived from the forest with information in hand and a compass that is telling them where to go. Rien and Maelik have entered and are waiting for Cassius to respond with his entry.Mar 7, 2015 19:29:04 GMT -8 Rien said:\"Thiss place sseemss sstrangely... Right... Yesss... I think thiss iss where we are ssuppossed to be,\" Rien told those who she fully expected to have accompanied her; Maelik and Cassius. Her unique accent and pronounced s's gave her voice away as a woman with the tongue of a snake, though whether literally or figuratively was up to speculation. Clearly in her current form her tongue was as human as one could imagine. She continued walking, not being able to help but notice what were clearly the remains of some sort of grand fortress, long past it's glory days. Mar 8, 2015 0:24:56 GMT -8 Maelik The Fellblade said:Maelik followed Rien pensively, making sure to keep his huge bulk in any shadows he could find and hoping that his dark colors would help him hide in the gloom. \"You're probably right little one, this place does have a strange sensation in the air. But that's not all there is, I smell company.\" Flicking his tongue out the great beast of a demon caught the scent of mortal flesh in the wind, and he didn't like what that entailed. That meant there could be more witnesses yet. \"Perhaps we should proceed with caution, what if their intent is hostile or worse... friendly!\" Still crawling on all fours so that he could better hug the ground for additional cover he kept himself about twenty paces behind the snake woman all the while, making a serious effort to keep his demonic aura from seeping out around him. \"Bloody home, to think I'd be reduced to lurking around like a common dretch, disgraceful...\" he muttered under his breath, keeping a keen eye on his partners to make sure they didn't get too far ahead. Though the nearby ruins looked like an interesting place to visit and logic did dictate that they'd be the smart place to begin the search for the next clue. More importantly there were better hiding places there. \"So then it's safe to assume we're meant to go meandering in there right?\" he asked with only a hint of well meaning sarcasm, though the well meaning part of it sounded forced to be sure.Satrage/Klearia \u2013 just arrived, also from the forest, and are in search of artifacts themselves. They are also involved with the quest, but not in the same context the prior mentioned group is.Mar 7, 2015 9:14:38 GMT -8 Satrage said:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At a large, lone broken pillar to a ruin, Satrage waited in silence. His blue cape and spiky hair ruffled in a slight breeze. He was alone, awaiting his companion, and should one be able to see a bit closer, they'd notice he was gazing at some foreign runes inscribed on the pillar, though whether he understood the language or just found it interesting was up to speculation.\u00a0 \u00a0 That is, until he drew energy invisibly into his form; the proximity of the runes seemed to provide some type of advantage to this. Yet as invisibly as he drew the mana, he spent it; within his own mind, he attempted to establish a link with Klearia... if only she would be back, soon.Mar 8, 2015 19:31:03 GMT -8 Klearia said:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Slowly but surely, Klearia arrived from another ruin.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Nothing there,\" she said, after having searched it thoroughly. \"What are you looking at?\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She moved over beside Satrage, and gazed at the runes.
