The cells are also very dark, the only light coming from the torches that hang on the walls. Slaves will be trained here after they are acquired from the streets in Erstonia. After arrival, they will be stripped of possessions as well as collared. They will be trained on proper etiquette and total obedience using the means of torture and fear conditioning.

Even Chataya had not come off clean in the fight with a mighty cut on one cheek that was still slightly bleeding anytime she moved her mouth to talk. The Prince, Kiera and all the rest would be brought in rough handed by the big Ogres. Their hands were chained with heavy metal and some had nasty wounds that they sustained in the fight. All of them would be put into cells, some with up to 5 at a time in cells that weren't meant to hold more than 1 or 2. The last to be put into a cell was Kiera and prince Rafael. She had almost immediately noticed the expensive clothing of the prince and took him for the best hostage, and Kiera had shown a good amount of battle skills so she didn't want her anywhere near the other to rile them up in rebellion against her. They would be brought to one of the cells that were furthest back in the facility. The light of day didn't reach there and even the torched only gave a small bit of light to the cells. The door would open and roughly the two would be shoved in there. \"Nice and cozy for you both.\" she would grin to both of them, especially lingering her eyes on Kiera, the one who had given her the cut on her cheek. She then turned around and started giving commands to the ogres. \"Strip the prisoners of their earthy clothes and check them for any marks. If anyone with my brand is found I wish to know immediately. If you find Tattoo's that might look like it could be a mark of rebellion I wish to know as well.
