It is crowned by a large dome, and several pillared roofed canopies. It comprises four floors: the lower basement containing tombs, an entrance storey, an ambulatory storey, and a roof terrace. On the long sides, vaulted hollows enclose doorways, with an analogous arch-shaped balcony above. These focal arches expand above the roof by use of an integrated fa\u00e7ade. To either side of the main arch are open rectangular spaces, domed and walled on three sides. The design is entirely equal and consistent on all sides of the building.The marble dome that surmounts the ossuary is an arresting feature. Its altitude is about the same size as the base building, and is accentuated because it sits on a cylindrical drum. The dome shape is underscored by four minor domed canopies placed at its corners. Their columned bases open through the roof of the ossuary, and provide light to the interior. Tall decorative spires extend from the boundaries of the base walls, and afford visual accent of the dome height. A great gate is situated to the north of the entrance forecourt, and provides an explicatory conversion linking the worldly realm and the spiritual realm. The corners are articulated with octagonal towers, giving the structure a defensive appearance. The Ossuary is bounded on three sides by crenellated kimberlite walls. The Entrance Storey contains a massive chandelier of bones that resemble humans and dragons \u2013 winged skeletons and other such oddities. Garlands of skulls loop toward the columns that provide description of each bone \u2013 three-thousand all together involve the chandelier. The rest of the room is lined with depictions of serpents, and deities, engraved into the walls. Four alabaster staircases ascend from the corners of the entrance storey, leading up to the roof. The front two staircases expand out into an ambulatory storey that wraps around the edifice as balconies. The terraced roof is a large expanse, with what seemed to be large scorch marks all across its marble floor, and large draconic monuments.Underneath the entire ossuary, the basement is what houses all the sarcophaguses, tombs, canopic jars that contain petrified organs, murals that depict funerary ceremonies, and other such things.Two large sarcophaguses are revered, said to house the remains of Ti\u2019amtum and Abzu.Numerous cenotaphs symbolize the bodies of the other minor deities, and numerous humble, marble tombs (approximately five feet by five feet) house royal family of the Sicarii.
