The chamber is also full of various historical treasures and trinkets that orium dragons are wont to keep, as well as several massive skulls of defeated enemies and some gems, as typical of blue dragons.Asaph has been known to disappear for months at a time before returning to his lair. Anyone caught living in the lair will be graciously moved to the nearest settlement... unless they are hostile, in which case they are promptly vaporized or eaten.", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/426/traakas-jungle"], "image_list": ["http://cdn2.landscapehdwalls.com/wallpapers/1/jungle-mountains-377-1920x1080.jpg", "http://orig08.deviantart.net/f3e3/f/2009/057/a/b/the_cave_by_jamga.jpg"], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"309\" src=\"http://cdn2.landscapehdwalls.com/wallpapers/1/jungle-mountains-377-1920x1080.jpg\" width=\"554\"/><br/></div>"}, "post-29392": {"user": "Asaph, Dream Hunter", "user_num": 770, "timestamp": "1458441532000", "message": "A more recent development.
