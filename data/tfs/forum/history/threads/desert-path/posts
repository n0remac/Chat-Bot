Still, she had witnessed the dwarf head out this way...Homeless and penniless, she just kept going. Eventually boulders and cliff faces and mesas took the place of flat sands, winds were more merciful, and shade could be found. Here, there was slightly more plant life.. aloe vera, yucca, and other sparse offerings from nature.She stopped to rest in the first spot of shade she could find.", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1518/coliseum"], "image_list": [], "html": "Somewhere down south, on the outskirts of inhospitable desert, sands began to turn to dry earth, the lands grew increasingly more craggy and rugged.

He would not let her wander by herself into the desert.

Now that there was more than sand, promising an end to the scorching earth, he recognized some of the species.\"I learned in Sakand once... if you feel the sun's burn too much, you can break one of those open and there's a sort of gel inside. It should help soothe the skin. They called it aloe vera.\"Biggs had abandoned his armor.

Lamina trekked on in silence, eventually and naturally falling behind Biggs as she figured he had more experience in long distance travel and was probably a better navigator. By the time the sun began to reduce in intensity during the early evening, her legs hurt even more.Eventually they would find a small running stream and pools of water. This was also where the foliage was denser and more green for the first time. It was here that she would ask to stop, and rest for the night. Exhaustion and pain had become a theme in this latest stage of her life, and she welcomed the mercy of the sun and the earth.\"Oh thank god..\" she said, half out of breath from the long journey, breaking an awkward silence.\"I'm staying here for right now... I can't go any further.\"With that, she sat on a rock, removed her sandy and torn Goraian shoes, and dipped her feet in the running water.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"Oh.
