It was much larger than a human and could probably make quick work of one. Asaph figured that large creatures came through here so rarely that the poor little thing must have evolved to strike at anything that wandered in. After a long, sympathetic gaze, Asaph felt a slight sting as the creature managed to crack one of his scales. Now mildly irritated, Asaph plucked the creature off by its pale, stubby tail. A red glowing luster rises from his belly towards his throat. Where it would exit his mouth a powerful jet of brilliant yellow flames gushes forth and roasts the screeching worm.
