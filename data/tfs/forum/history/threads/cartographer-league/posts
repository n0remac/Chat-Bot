The Cartographer League is here to help encourage RP and increase your knowledge on the IC workings of the land.((IC characters will be part of this group, but I request that only one being from each government be in the Cartographer League and a few players who are non-governments associated. I would like this to be something that is accepted and approved by all other players and administration so that we can push this forum forward and created a more legitimate idea of what Overworld consists of))", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The Cartographer is nothing short of being important.
