Black cloth draped itself down the horses body, almost to the point of it touching the ground. The rider was silent, a statue almost, his body covered in cloth much like the horse. The horse snorted aggressively, it's eyes wild. Two plated hands tugged on the reins, pulling the horse to the right ever so gently. A cold breeze manipulated the drapes of the rider beautifully, but soon stopped as he made his way deeper into the forest. A second horse appeared from behind a tree, and the rider was joined by a fellow traveler.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The sound of a horse walking across the forest floor alerted squirrels and birds as a rider made his way in between the trees.

Words were redundant to them, for they shared the same life force, the same drive. They were a part of a larger entity. Communication was there and constant, but not in the eye of a mortal man.
