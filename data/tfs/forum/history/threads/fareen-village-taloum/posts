Thanks to devious planning the siege was slowed by destroying two of the Glaive launchers, but eventually resources of food and ammunition dwindled to the point where the walls could no longer be defended and the gate was finally breached.It took time to navigate through and deactivate traps, but it was done. The remaining bandits were killed or taken prisoner. Many had died but Aozora came through victorious, those who survived had become stronger through the experience in battle. With control of the town, Aozora's range of influence had increased and even though innocent lives had been lost as well, this was ultimately for the better for the security of the region. Over the next few months trials would be held, using information gathered from spies that had infiltrated the town months before. With Taloum now under occupation of Aozora, the quality of life would begin on the track of improvement. The Ao got to work fixing the damage to the town and establishing an infrastructure in Taloum. People may be unsure about Aozora because of the destructive power of their siege weapons, but so far things were better than before, they were treated as Ao people. Unfortunately during the week-long siege, Aozora lost an important member of their society, Master Ming Yunxu. The former Katashiman general was a founding member of Aozora and a valuable counsel to the Marquis, his health was in decline but he insisted on going to one last battle. From the start of the battle he had been there guiding the officers, but as the days past his illness became worse and remained in bed for the rest of the siege. A physician was there with him, but it was his time to go. When he heard they had infiltrated the town, he sighed in relief and closed his eyes, knowing he didn't need to hold on any longer, his job was done.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The battle for Taloum finally began, the last step toward Aozora becoming a professional army. While sieging the town, another operation was lead by Ram Jam to sieze the farmlands that provide for the town. When the bandits attempted to meet Aozora in battle many of their ranks were mowed down by the new contraptions Aozora had made, after one of the Glaive Launchers was aimed just right to kill many men with one shot the bandit faction made no more attempts to exit the town without dealing with the weapons. Thanks to devious planning the siege was slowed by destroying two of the Glaive launchers, but eventually resources of food and ammunition dwindled to the point where the walls could no longer be defended and the gate was finally breached."}}
