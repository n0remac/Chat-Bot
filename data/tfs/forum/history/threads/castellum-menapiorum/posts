He didn't feel confident that the wilds were limited to 'small groups' of anything.Still, it was worth it if he could locate some of the harder to find supplies the parade's festivities required, and he heard that Magister Elias himself had been working towards the improvement of the fort fairly recently. This seemed like just the place to find lodging for he and his band of eight when they weren't combing nearby trade routes for the contacts he needed.Peace fell over him like smoke on a breeze as the wagon stopped in front of the fort.

Then he changed it again. He knew that if he could get Aelius to do what he asked, it would work Aelius's mind a little more, trying to confuse it. Whether it would work or not, he didn't know, but he had to try.\"Also Captain, before you go directly to them, why don't you ask some of the others what they saw. I know someone witnessed it. That way you can get a better idea of what happened, that way you can cipher the truth from any lies.\" He spoke to Aelius, \"Once you get done with your duties, would you mind visiting me on my post later.

Lanius was sitting on a rock surrounded by a few other men, they were playing dice and making some bets, Quintus was nearby taking good care of what was left of the stew that was served at dinner. When the soldiers noticed their captain many muted and the culprits arose.\"Follow me.\" Said Aellius.Both soldiers started following until they reached Aelius's tent, they didn't utter a word. \"Lanius, Quintus how many years have passed? How many years we spent fighting and seeing our brothers die in that forsaken mountain pass?\"\"Too many, captain.\" Said Quintus.\"True, and our only recognition was the death of one of ours at the hands of a 'friend'. Lanius, Quintus i wish that what i think is false and i'm beign corrupted by this rotten life i chosed, but i need to ask you. Did any of you pulled out a stupid knife and tryied to gut that red haired idiot?\" Said Aelius.\"I did captain.\" Said Lanius. \"He had no right to act like he owned the place and much less like one of our brothers, i thought a little scare would put him in his place.\"\"Yet both of you were defeated and humilliated by a supposed rookie.\" Responded Aelius. \"I don't care how he acted, your little scare has backfired quite bad. Good thing no one got hurt because if that would've been the case we won't be talking right now. Just this time, you dig the latrines of the entire camp and if the priest needs any help you'll be the ones to help him.\" When Aelius finished talking with his men a woman entered the tent carrying a bottle, Aelius thought he saw her next to the magister when he arrived at the fort, somekind of servant. Aelius gestured both the soldiers to leave.\"I do suppose thats poison and the magister wants me replaced for a man that can control his men.\" Spoke Aelius.\"The Magister sends his apologies about his speech towards your men, he hopes that his words did not offend your honor.\" She left the bottle in the table in front of Aelius.\" This is the first liquor brew from this land, this is a compliment from the lord to you and your men.\"\"When you see the Magister, tell him to not worry about anything. I appreciate the gift but i must refuse, it's not my right to taste it yet, not until there's enough for a whole company.\" Said Aelius with a smile giving the bottle back to the woman. \"Now if you excuse me i need to get my equiptment ready for tomorrow.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"Your post shall be the entire camp, since we dont have a wall yet.
