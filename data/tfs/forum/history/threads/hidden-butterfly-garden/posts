The area is accessible only by the old wooden bridge, as the area is surrounded by a flowing river. Upon entering the garden, you may become aware of the variety of sounds that are present. From the tweeting of the birds to the sound of wind passing through flowers, this place is a varied and abundant place. At the lightest part of the morning, soon after the sun has risen, you may come into contact with the myriad of butterflies which call this place their home. The abundance of flowers welcome these butterflies which creates an almost magical experience. And on the other hand, once the sun has left the sky and the moon is now above, fireflies cover the area, lighting up all of the vast vegetation and colourful flowers. This is a place of tranquility and calm, and is almost straight from a fairytale. It is said that this has been the meeting spot for lovers for years and years. However, that is not to say that individuals cannot find peace and solace in this location.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://hdwpics.com/images/1E053A96D53A/Butterfly-Garden.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://hdwpics.com/images/1E053A96D53A/Butterfly-Garden.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/><br><br/><br/><u style=\"font-style:italic;\">Hidden Butterfly Garden</u><br/><br/><br/><div style=\"text-align:left;\">There is a place, near to the city of Medan, which is only known by few.

It rocked slightly back and forth at her touch. Whilst crossing the bridge, she attempted to rid her mind of any ill thoughts or qualms, and tried to enter a state of relaxation. As her feet met the grass on the other side of the bridge, a small smile reached her face. She looked up to find a variety of different coloured birds, all shapes and sizes, lining the trees and singing their songs. As she walked, the clink of her daggers was almost an unnatural sound in contrast to the area around her. She wandered until she found her favourite place. There was a willow tree, completely white and shining brightly in the sun. Gently, Alice pushed aside some of the long branches and sat herself under the tree. She felt safe here. This was a place of rest and contemplation. You could say that this place was an escape for Alice, as her fears and worries were cast away in the beauty of the garden.'I remember the first time I found this place...' She thought, 'It was with him, wasn't it?'She shook her head at the mere thought and leaned back against the tree. She tilted her head up and closed her eyes, allowing the clean air to surround and engulf her.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Alice took a deep breath before placing her foot on the wooden bridge in front of her.

She knelt down to see tiny, red toadstools with little bugs using them almost like thrones. When she looked up she saw trees covered in twirling vines which hosted a magnificent array of the most majestic flowers.She sat down again on a moss covered log. She removed her notebook from her pouch and began to write with her quill and ink:'Today there was also no work. I'm beginning to get fearful - but I refuse to give up. I wonder what you'd do if you saw me now. You'd just laugh, wouldn't you? I know you would. You'd laugh and lecture me on how to be\u00a0resilient\u00a0and self-sufficient, I know it. But you're not here to tell me that anymore, are you? Sometimes in dreams I see you. You'd laugh at that too, wouldn't you? You knew me well but I knew you better.Nevertheless, I will continue to look for work.'She stopped writing and put away the notebook that was being used as her diary. She sighed gently before taking another glance around the garden.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Alice jolted awake - she had fallen asleep against the willow tree.
