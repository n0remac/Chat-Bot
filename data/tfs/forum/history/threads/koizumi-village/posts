It would be a good Kimono to wear to a night party or a festival. The second fabric was much simpler and made of a light blue. The design on it was of flowers and blue birds with white swirling details to close the empty spaces. It was a kimono that could be worn for many occasions. The third and last fabric she was allowed to pick left her to walk around a long time. The many types of fabrics that were available made her unsure of what to pick. In the end she decided to go with a light green kimono with a design of white and red flowered branches and peacocks dancing past the branches. It would be perfect for spring days and summer parties. They picked Obi's that would fit with the design and a mix of two white and one black under kimono. Just as she was about to think she was done and could call Isao back inside the old lady touched her on the shoulder. \"The way you picked those Kimono's tell me you know a lot about them. Someone who appreciates the art of the kimono's this much is a valued costumer to me. I know you will wear the kimono with grace and happiness. I have a few old kimono's laying in the back, I am sure some of them are your size. If you would like, you can pick one for free as long as you wear a smile when you wear it.\" This almost brought tears to Nakatani's eyes and she was led to a backroom filled with stored Kimono. One of them instantly caught her eyes. It was a yellow creme design with a blue bottom, it was filled with colorful flowers and birds were flying around as free as they could go. She pointed it out and the lady took down the Kimono from its standard and started to dress her. The lady was very practiced and it didn't take long before Nakatani was fit in the kimono, an Obi from a light blue design with a few birds on it attached to her waist and the kimono fitting around her waist. The back was lowered out like a Geisha weirs it on her request and for the first time in a long time Nakatani was stunned by her own appearance. \"Thank you.\" she said with an emotional tone to her voice. As Nakatani redid her hair, she did it in an elegant up do, not something that was usual for a Geisha, but something that she had worn it in many times in casual situations. She stepped back in her shoes and instantly got back in her Geisha routine, her steps were short but controlled, making the back of the kimono look like it flowed in the water behind her.
