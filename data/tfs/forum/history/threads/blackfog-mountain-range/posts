No man has entered the range since the cataclysm decimated the kingdoms of old, and the fate of the once-great Dwarven Kingom that once reigned over the expanse remains unknown to the outside world. The mountain range covers a massive area in the westernmost portion of the continent, a thick, impenetrable fog obscuring all but the highest peaks, visible from miles away. It has been said that once one enters the fog, they never find their way out again. Curiously, this does not seem to affect Dwarvenkind.Unbeknownst to mankind, Dwarves still survive beneath the mountains, although they are fragmented and their once-mighty kingdom is in ruin. The last known heir to the Dwarven throne seeks to change that, however. Having found and united a sizable group of roving Dwarven survivors, he begins his quest to restore the Dwarven Kingdom to its rightful place as the greatest in all of history, toiling away stubbornly to that end, his conviction unbreakable and his devotion to his duty infallible.Under his guidance ,the Dwarven Kingdom will rise again!", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i61.tinypic.com/1z3ru9t.jpg", "http://i57.tinypic.com/f3xqid.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"Blackfog Mountains\" src=\"http://i61.tinypic.com/1z3ru9t.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}, "post-575": {"user": null, "user_num": null, "timestamp": "1425691001000", "message": "They used to call him Berkohm Hammerfist.

Something was finally starting to fall together, as more Dwarves heard of his small gathering and came to join themselves. Finally, he had about two-hundred Dwarves toiling for the glory of the old Kingdom. Every day more expeditions left the growing village to explore more of the twisting caverns. Ironhide's cartographers' maps grew every single day, but not a single exit into the overworld had yet been found. In addition, not every expedition returned, and some brought back with them small hordes of under-Orcs or goblins, which always killed a Dwarf or two before being utterly slaughtered.Still, despite these setbacks, the village continues to grow, and Fenrik sits upon his crude stone throne in the village center, overlooking his loyal followers work. All of a sudden, a Dwarven scout garbed in spider chitin armour rushes out from one of the tunnels that exits into the sprawling cavern that houses their village, his little legs moving almost too quickly to see as he sprints up the stairs to kneel before the King's throne. \"Your Sturdiness, I've found something of great importance,\" he says, barely waiting for an acknowledgement before continuing, \"I was scouting East of our village when I came across an ancient crumbling hold, much like any other, only this one was surrounded by ravenous cave-drakes! I could hear shouting from within -- not the raspy horrid bawling of goblins, but the powerful warcries of our brethren!\"Fenrik's bushy brow raises slightly as he stands, brushing his tattered regal cape over his shoulder as he looks down at the messenger. \"You are certain? In that case, inform my personal guard and gather the warriors. Leave only a handful of elites behind to guard the village. We begin our reclamation today!\"The scout runs off with no small degree of excitement to carry out his orders, as Fenrik removes the mithril circlet serving as a crown from his head, putting it aside as he replaces it with the kingly great helm sitting beside his throne, reaching around to the other side to gather his ancestral mithril battleaxe, running a finger lightly across the serrated blade and wincing as it draws blood. His massive suit of armour would be extraordinarily heavy if not for the fact that it's forged from pure mithril, with Dwarven Steel lining. He steps down the stairs leading from his throne, and prepares to meet his warriors before battle. Glory will soon be his -- he can almost taste it.--------------------------------------------------------------------------Meanwhile, in a quite far off section of the tunnels, a lonely Dwarven scout roams, having lost the rest of his expedition to cavern cats and goblins and subsequently thoroughly lost his bearings. He had subsisted the past few weeks on giant mushroom and hunted cave spiders, as well as a disguisting roasted leg of goblin on a particularly bad day. However, little did he know that he was quite close to an exit to the Overworld. The tapping of feet and a cane can be heard lumbering along, and the scout quickly hides in a nearby crevice.However, when the owner of the tapping cane comes into view, it's revealed to be an old Dwarven sage, and so the scout reveals himself. \"Hail, brother,\" he says with a tired grin, \"I have not seen one of our kind in weeks!

She was forced to pull herself into sitting up against a nearby boulder to get partially upright.
