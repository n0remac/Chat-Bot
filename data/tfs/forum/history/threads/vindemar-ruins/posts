There were no sounds of whistling air; no drip-drops of water; no scurrying of rats.  It seemed entirely devoid of life, sound, and was certainly devoid of magic of any kind.  The sheer silence would be enough to drive ordinary men mad, should they stay here for the night.  Attila would find this place exactly like that: quiet and placid, and devoid of anything.  The walls were dry, constructed of some old stone and polished long ago; the floor was dry too, and maybe at one point it was a light grey in color, but it was no as black as the darkest night.  Columns supported the ceilings, also black.  There were several hallways and rooms stretching out from the center of the keepAnd then, a bootstep.  And another.  And another.  They came slowly, but whoever the person was they wanted their approach to be heard.  They wanted Attila to know that he was not alone.  Making his way around one of the walls of one of the hallways, he slowly appeared from the darkness.  It was Dietrich the Sadist.  He was a Brother, of the Brotherhood, and had been since their crusade against the Wickans some years ago.  But he did not wear the white surcoat and black cross of the Brothers, and he did not don the plated armor he had been given by the Vessian Empire.  Rather, he wore some dark, twisted, beaten plate armor.  Perhaps, even, he had rid himself of the vows and oaths he had taken as a Brother - now he was something else entirely.  He was a killer, a murderer... a Sadist.The former OrdenMarschall of the Brothers of the Sword stood quiet a distance down a hallway from Attila, and within the darkness he'd be hard to see.  But if Attila knew anything about the Brothers, he would know this was the dreaded OrdenMarschall, Hochmeister Konrad's right-hand man, and the executioner of the Duchy of Audria.\"I'm glad you came,\" he said in a hushed whisper.  At that moment Attila would probably hear at least a dozen more footsteps as armored mercenaries came out of the other hallways to surround him with weapons: swords, axes, shields, maces, and other items grabbed from dead bodies on the battlefield.  If Attila tried to move, he would find the mercenaries would push him back to the middle of where he was.  One of the mercenaries had blood pouring from his stomach, as if he had been stabbed; truth was, he had been stabbed, but was miraculously alive somehow..  Dietrich himself drew a long, executioner-style long sword from his back and started walking towards Attila and the other mercenaries, dragging the tip of the blade on the ground behind him as he approached very slowly.\"Do you know where you are?\"  Dietrich asked in a sinister and ambiguous manner.  \"This is Vindemar Keep.  Or at least, what is left of it.  They say you can't die here.\"  Dietrich was now amongst the group and put one hand on the stabbed mercenaries shoulder.  \"My friend here proves that theory is true; we stabbed him, and his wound would have killed an ordinary man, but you see he yet lives.\"  Dietrich turned his head and hollered into another room, \"we're ready.\"Some old hag hobbled out from another room, panting terribly.  Her voice was strained and scratchy when she spoke from beneath her dark robes.  \"We must leave this place soon, Dietrich, my lord!  The lack of magic is most... unnerving.\"Dietrich nodded his head at the old hag and turned back to Attila.  \"We'll be finished here soon enough,\" he said.  \"Bind him.\"The twelve mercenaries would work together to wrestle with Attila, attempt to restrain him, and attempt to tie his wrists and ankles.  Should any of these mercenaries be stabbed, cut, or otherwise injured they would shrug it off and continue trying to bind Attila up; they were apparently brainwashed and heeded the command of Dietrich.Assuming you complyOnce Attila was bound, the mercenaries would lie him face down on the ground.  If he writhed around the mercenaries would restrain him as best they could.\"Now comes the fun part,\" Dietrich grinned as he picked his executioners sword up and placed it on the back of Attila's neck.  \"Know why they call me the Sadist, Attila,\" he asked casual like, as if killing and torturing did not bother him.  \"Because I love to torture my prisoners before I kill them.  Sometimes, I like to hang them up and watch the vultures pick out their insides.  Sometimes I like to strangle them with their own intestines.  I've even eaten their organs while they still live.\"  Dietrich chuckled, \"there's nothing like eating someone alive.  You eat what you kill, that's what pa always taught me.\"  Dietrich laughed but finally exhaled deeply...He brought the large executioner sword into the air and with one mighty blow brought it down onto Attila's neck, beheading him.His head would be hanging onto his body by a few strips of skin for sure, because of the angle of the swing.  But the mighty Vessian Knight bent down and grabbed Attila's hair before ripping the head completely off and holding it up till they were both face to face (or in this case, head-to-head).  Dietrich laughed and chuckled, hollered and giggled as he looked at the body-less head.But Attila was not dead, oh no.  He was very much alive.  It was the curse of Vindemar Keep that kept him alive.  He could still talk, see, hear, feel, think, and smell.  He simply had no body!  \"How do you feel, my good man?\" Dietrich asked Attila, enjoying every minute of this.", "link_list": ["/user/1225"], "image_list": ["http://i273.photobucket.com/albums/jj222/ande012/beheaded.png"], "html": "<span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-1225 group-0\" href=\"/user/1225\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@smarmy\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Attla, the Conniving</span></a></span>"}, "post-39480": {"user": "Attla, the Conniving", "user_num": 1225, "timestamp": "1464452878000", "message": "\"Oh I'm fine my good friend!\" He responded.Well he tried to respond.
