Cooling off after the work the Lord of Winter let his mind wander, thinking aloud, \"What if we were to join a kingdom, like old times. Would we still be sowing fields, and protecting ourselves from wild animals? Would we still be stuck here in the wilds?\" The lord sighed, these thoughts were already known to his people and members of his own family.

He had several cousins and other distant relatives throughout the village, but his aunt was like his mother. The lord moved his horse away from the fields and rode a slow trot back to the castle. His Men-at-Arms would be gathered and ready for the evening patrol. A force of only 20. But each of the men were worth 4 and under Crovan's command they proved to be worth over 100. A fact proven 7 years ago when a large group of bandits attacked Castle Winter hoping to take it over as a base of operations. Crovan was thinking about the fight. It was his greatest triumph and failure. There were 113 bandits, he only knew this because they counted the bodies. A child was assigned as a look out in the castle's main tower, as is often done as punishment. If the bandits hadn't entered a clearing in the woods and was spotted by the child... The story would be different. A bell was rang. Everyone knew what it meant. A simple rule understood by the village; get to the castle or you'll die. Men-at-Arms quickly gathered their gear, ancient but well maintained armor worn by the first of the House of Winter's men on their arrival to the castle. The bandits however were drawn by the bell. The castle was built long before siege engines, low walls to allow better shots from archers, only one entrance to the castle to reduce enemy numbers attacking at any one time. These are Castle Winter's only defensive features. Perfect for this fight. Men-at-Arms manned their position. A defensive line across the entrance to the castle. Crovan, only 17, stood among them.His thoughts were interrupted however by arriving at his destination. The lord dismounted his steed and strode into the castle. A stable boy tending to the horse.
