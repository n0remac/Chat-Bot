Apart from Brewers on the ship, there are a few dozen Dolburrim Marines or \"Marinesoldaten der Dolburrimesisch\" to act as a more official military force. They are armed with long crossbows and harpoons, and all are armed with modified and re-made sabres looted off of repelled pirates. There are a few alchemists, Engineers and a handful of Shamans aboard as well.
