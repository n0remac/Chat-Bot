Anyone can, in my opinion, reach a certain level, should they train hard enough and want it bad enough.\" He looked back at his tribe. \"I would say that those that are here now wouldn't want to leave I am sad to inform you. The men under my charge came in families and close knit communities. None of them I think has any notions of true ambition for adventure.\" He informed Vorkul raising his hands up from his side to gesture he didn't know what else to tell him.He thought about it for a moment, looking at the larger dragonkin. \"I have a question about our kind. Is there more of us? I mean like, lots more. Or are we a dying breed? I just don't know where I come from and I want to find out.\" His mind sparked a bulb in his head. \"I'll make you a deal. Allow me to name one of my men the new guard-captain of this tribe. Leave them be to their own devices and help me find out just who I truly am, and I will join you and your band.\" He offered with a smile. \"I know I don't look like much but you are speaking to a battlemage, graduated from the arcane academy of Gauldin and a former member of its army. Promise me we can return every know and then to check up on these people and I will follow you.\"He looked back at the tribe, \"These people have given so much, but I just can't help but shake this feeling like I am meant for more. And you seem decent enough, and seem to have a sense of luck and good timing. Perhaps this is what I have been waiting for.\" He said offering Vorkul his hand. \"Do we have a deal?\"While Vorkul didn't know for sure about their race, he answered as truthfully as he knew.\"Aye, there are more, but not many. We are rare, usually living alone or within much larger groups of another race. We are not a 'dying race' per se, but we are few. If we have a homeland, I do not know of it.\"He himself had grown up among a small town of elves, but that was only while he was very young, he could not remember it well.Drakken  described his previous military history and experience, then the deal. @vorkul  listened carefully. He forcefully shook his new brother's hand.\"Of course we have a deal. I will give you up to two days time to say your goodbyes, then we'll be off. We can definitely visit in between our travels, even meet a few of our other members' homes if you wish to.\"He looked off at the buildings in the distance. Him and Drakken  would see them again, @vorkul  promised it.Drakken smiled and nodded. \"Well then. I guess I had best make preparations for my new life then.\" He said happily as he turned to head back into the tribe. He would need to name a new guard-captain, explain to the tribe the situation and say his goodbyes to those who had been so dear to him in recent times. All in all, it was going to be a strange, new chapter in his life.<exit>", "link_list": ["/post/55236/thread", "/post/55169/thread", "/user/1827", "/user/1827", "/user/1827"], "image_list": ["//storage.proboards.com/6046952/images/uCQvKjMwQCSfGa7d4dCT.jpg", "http://i.imgur.com/Q0p3CYz.png"], "html": "<div author=\"@vorkul\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/55236/thread\" timestamp=\"1477927144\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-0\" title=\"vorkul\"><img alt=\"vorkul Avatar\" src=\"//storage.proboards.com/6046952/images/uCQvKjMwQCSfGa7d4dCT.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/55236/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1477927144000\" title=\"Oct 31, 2016 7:19:04 GMT -8\">Oct 31, 2016 7:19:04 GMT -8</abbr></a>  @vorkul said:</div><div author=\"@drakken\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/55169/thread\" timestamp=\"1477855661\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-1827\" title=\"Drakken\"><img alt=\"Drakken Avatar\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Q0p3CYz.png\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/55169/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1477855661000\" title=\"Oct 30, 2016 11:27:41 GMT -8\">Oct 30, 2016 11:27:41 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-1827 group-0\" href=\"/user/1827\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@drakken\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Drakken</span></a></span> said:</div>Drakken smiled and nodded. \"I agree.
