The figure, clearly larger than anything that could possibly swim in that river, slowly began to uncurl itself.\u00a0For 800 years, the fisherman in the nearby village had steered their boats around a large underwater outcropping. Legend told of a River Guardian, who would bless those who lived in harmony with the river, and destroy all who did not. For 800 years, the locals had left tributes of sunken canoes, laden with gold panned from the river, delectable fish, and once a decade, a live alligator strapped to the inside. The tributes would disappear, carried off by the flow of the river or eaten by the local wildlife, but the village prospered, and so they continued this ritual.\u00a0Until today.\u00a0The first thing she remembered was the uncomfortableness of centuries of tributes buried around her. Wood and ceramics did not tend to be the most comfortable of beds or sheets. She slowly stretched out, causing plumes of silt to rise to the surface. Fish, inherently attuned to her presence, continued on as if she did not exist, for she did not call to them. The second thing she tasted was the water...which tasted...off. That was what had woken her up from her centuries long slumber.\u00a0The sickening rain from Aaedan had washed into the river, diluted it was not as potent, but left a sickening taste for the River Watcher to discern. Something was polluting her river, and she was going to find out what. Her head shot out of the water like a periscope, shocking the fishermen nearby, who ran screaming back to their village. She chuckled as she enjoyed the warmth of the sun for the first time in a long time. She saw nothing amiss in her immediate surroundings, so she sunk low back into the water, with just her head sticking up, and began to swim downriver.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Deep within the calm, clear depths of the Apparatchik River, a pair of piercing yellow eyes awakens for the first time in almost a millenia.
