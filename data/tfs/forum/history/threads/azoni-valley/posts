The small streams running through the valley could be heard trickling and the birds chirped a song that helped set the mood. All seemed perfect and Rose was at ease. The calm feeling didn't last long as the crunching of leaves and twigs could be heard around him and his owl companion, Sir Hoot. \u00a0A gentle breeze picked up beneath the half barren treetops that didn't seem to stir a leaf on them. On the ground a single leaf was picked up and blowing in front of him like a guide. When Rose was in his home land, he let the spirit of nature guide him despite the constant feeling of being watched.\"Sir Hoot, would you mind looking around?\" Rose spoke to the owl in a low tone so that he might not be heard.Rose had trained with his old leader and had learned the trait of falconry like any of the warriors. He raised his arm up and outwards so that the own would take off into flight. Rose didn't want the owl getting hurt and maybe by some chance this own could scout for him. He would probably have to cipher the message if it could but it was worth a try.\u00a0Night soon fell on Rose and the owl. The stars flickered through the treetops and the Moon glistened like a white sun in the darkness. The forest was beautiful and eerie, making it a scary place to travel at night. The soothing day time forest was no more; the hunt was beginning. Rose still had one more hour to go before he'd reach his destination and whatever was following him never attacked.

Rose stuck his hands out and caught one, watching it flash in his hands. He could feel the warmth of the insect with every flash that lit up. The insect crawled to the top of Rose's right hand and flew off to be with the others, vanishing the moment it lifted off into the darkness.\u00a0A soft smile crossed the face of Rose as he laid witness for the first time on the insect. He had heard many stories but found them to be a myth since he was never allowed outside after dark in the expanse of the valley. Rose could no longer see the tumbling leaf, but the fireflies seemed to guide him along just fine. The worries of the night seemed to wash away as he grew happier and happier, the thoughts of what happened here slowly drifting further to the back of his mind.\u00a0The insects began to fly off shortly after their arrival. With the darkness closing back in on him, his attention returned to the crunching of leaves and twigs around him. Once the insects were cleared, Rose could see a silver light ahead. The closer he got, the more he could see, like the old ruins the radiated the noticeable light. The he heard the growls and snarls of wolves. Rose froze in place and hid behind a tree. He was coming from the wrong side of the woods in new clothes and new magic, making him a target to the wolves.\u00a0Rose was too far in for hiding to do any good and he knew he was being \"escorted\". \u00a0Rose turned to his right, then to his left, then behind him, but when he went to peak in front of the tree, he had a surprise waiting for him. A wolf the size of a bear was looking Rose right in the eyes with his gums pulled back to reveal the razor sharp teeth that could easily pierce through armor with enough pressure. Rose was startled and went to fall backwards until something furry caught him. When he caught his balance and realized it was a wolf, he pinned his back to the tree.\u00a0A total of three large wolves were now present, the escort revealing itself. Their furs were brown and black with gentle splashes on white, giving the fur coat an armor look. A white diamond could be seen on the head of each wolf between their eyes. The wolves were the size of a Kodiak bear. Their muscles were well represented in their fur and their hide as dense as steel. The three wolves would slowly begin to circle around Rose, looking away from him and into the darkness. They were watching for something with all their senses focused.After Rose marveled at their size and furs, he took notice of their stress. Rose looked off into the distance himself, trying to see if he could spot something. Shortly after the wolves formed their defensive perimeter around Rose, Sir Hoot returned to Rose. \u00a0When the owl was fully perched, he began to jerk his head to the right over and over. Rose tried the first thing that came to mind, to turn to his right. The theory was a success; the owl quit turning it's head and spread out it's wings while letting out a powerful screech.Rose would throw his arm out to send Sir Hoot back into the treetops where he could do his best. The wolves began to growl and show their teeth, focusing in one specific direction. \u00a0Rose quickly took an aggressive stance that allowed him to be as ready as he possibly could be without a weapon. What he didn't know is he was in for his first debut with two Succubus that were around nine feet in height and armed.A series of voices slipped into the mind of Rose, hearing the thoughts of the wolves. Their thoughts rested on battle and killing whatever came their way. \u00a0He could even hear the Sir Hoot in their network, but for some reason he could not respond to him. Rose kept quiet and listened while he formulated his own plan to coincide with theirs. In a split second Rose focused on the new sound of a scratchy scream and plenty of unpleasant words about an owl to follow. When Rose went to look at the wolves, they were gone. The sounds of the blood curdling screams and the ferocious barks and crunching of armor. \u00a0While Sir Hoot and the wolves focused on the two Succubus, Rose was caught by surprise by a short Incubus of eight feet in height. He was armed with a short sword in his right hand and chains in his left. The Incubus had a green tint to it and resembled a snake in the face. He was bald all over and had little armor on, expecting to easily catch Rose. It didn't take long for the Succubus to attack.A thunderous boom rang as the Incubus planted his sword in the tree, \"My your a fine looking toy. We could do many things with your young physique and high stamina. I might just buy you at auction if you come available! Now you can come easily or I can make you come, and in more than one way.\" The Incubus finished off his last line as he winked at Rose.Rose stood two feet shorter than the Incubus at 5'8\". Rose would stare into the eyes of the Incubus, ignoring every word he said and focused in on killing it. Rose's eyes began to shift into their slitted form and his teeth began to morph. Once the eyes were fully complete, the human side of Rose was gone. His lips would peel back to reveal an set of fanged teeth that resembled that of a wolves in many aspects. His muscles would slightly grow, stretching his armor just a bit more.\u00a0A deep growl escaped the esophagus of Rose and was followed with a serious of words in a very low pitched voice, \"You will die. They will die. Every last one your kind will die. When I am done here, I will turn to the Holy. They will pay for the creation of you and your evil.\"The Incubus was not pleased and punched at Rose with his right hand, leaving his sword in the tree. This fist did not reach its destination of Rose's face. Rose's right hand shot forward and wrapped around the fist. Rose's feet dug three inches into the ground immediately, forcing his left hand to grab the wrist of the fist. The fist stopped inches from his face that carried a smirk that he made sure the Incubus seen.\"You thought you were fighting Rose? Do you think that boy would have threatened you? He doesn't know his own power... but I do. Here, let me show you what it is!\" Rose's form laughed when it was done speaking.\u00a0Razor sharp claws ripping through Rose's fingertips, sending blood flying like a popped pimple when they first broke through. Once the tips broke from Rose's skin, they would begin piercing through the skin of the Incubus. As the claws grew, Rose tightened his grip, digging the claws as he could into the wrist and fist of the Incubus. The Incubus attempted to come in with his left hand, but as the Incubus tried, Rose dug his right foot into the groin of the Incubus. The Incubus hit the ground holding himself with his free hand while Rose still held the other.\u00a0\"Bow before me, filth!\" Rose shouted at the Incubus as Rose twisted the Incubus's arm in a counter clockwise motion to move with the joints and placed himself behind the Incubus with his foot planted into the right shoulder joint to push the Incubus into the dirt and break his should while doing so.A red pulse surged from the pendant on Rose's neck. The blood that drained from the Incubus began to rise into the air and flow back into it. Behind the Incubus blood was Rose's blood. Rose showed no mercy as he flipped the Incubus over with his mangled arm, making sure to break the bones even worse. He'd plant his left foot on the throat of the Incubus and smile that seemed so innocent. In the snap of your fingers, the fight was over. Blood shot through the Incubus's skin in the exact pattern of it's veins. There was no mess until the chunks of flesh started to fall. The blood swirled in mid air as it would have inside the Incubus, but it ripped through the body like it was a razor line. Once the body came out of shock and the Incubus realized what happened, the remainder of the body fell apart into strips of flesh and bone.\u00a0After the defeat of the Incubus, the Rose and the current mind in control, would have an argument of who needed to be in control. Rose used a very factual discussion and the Darkness used a more theoretical approach. The two knew they needed each other to live, but one believed in working together while the other wanted full control. \u00a0By the end of the discussion, Rose assumed control over his body again and was back in his normal mind.Rose couldn't hear anything around him, hopefully meaning his allies were successful, and they were. The wolves were just returning from their fight when they noticed the cubed body lying under Rose. Like the other Incubus bodies, the wolves would consume the remaining chunks of body to rid of it. There was magic involved in the reason they ate the meat, but it also tasted delicious.\u00a0When the remains were gone, the wolves nudged for Rose to follow them. The group would head towards the lighted ruins once again, this time having no more issues. Sir Hoot had decided to perch on Rose's right forearm again, this time having blood stains on it's, primarily his talons. When the group reached the ruins, they were greeted by dozens of wolves in all different shapes, sizes, and colors. In unison, every wolf, even the escorts, turned to Rose and let out a howl like they would to the Moon. When their howl was done, more howls throughout the valley could be heard; some close and some so far their howls were but whispers.Azoni Wolf Pack home.The communication Rose had earlier re-established itself and a scratchy elder male voice spoke to Rose, \"Child, your father tended to our sick and wounded. He never betrayed our location or asked for payment. The time has come for us to repay him for the many years he blessed our pack. Please come with me, we have much to discuss!.\"All the wolves but one old white and grey wolf left. This wolf resembled a Timberwolf in his looks and figure. This wolf walked towards Rose and right past him towards a smaller structure within the ruins the was probably one of the least attractive structures here. \u00a0The architecture was dull and the plants were consuming the cracked stone walls, breaking them even more. When the two reached inside the elder wolf's home, Rose noticed he had a fire going. The elder wolf made his way towards a burrow he had filled with cushion to form a comfortable bed for his old body.\u00a0\"My boy, it has been a long night for us and I am feeling weak. I am going to rest for awhile and you should do the same. I have so much to tell you and prepare you for before you reach your tribe.\" The elder wolf communicated before lying down and turning his head away from Rose.Rose had no use for sleep, nor did he want to, but leaving somewhere safe to possibly be eaten by another wolf was not on the agenda either. With a slight huff, Rose pulled out a frosted plum from his sack to settle the hunger he faced that wasn't for normal food,\u00a0and ate it before lying down on the soft leaves and going to sleep. Tomorrow was a new day and he didn't have much he could do on this night but go to sleep.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i1373.photobucket.com/albums/ag395/Fireflysongs55/Gifts%20and%20Curses/Gifts%20and%20Curses%20Regions/66_zps7530f86e.jpg"], "html": "A blue swarm of fireflies made themselves present as they lit up around Rose like an endless see of blue sparks.

Rose could feel the warmth from the sun light, a feeling his cold body lusted for. Too much light could become an issue, but the light coming through the treetops was not enough to do any harm. When he sat up, he looked around and noticed the elder wolf was sitting beside him.\u00a0\"Your guardians told us what you turned into out there when fighting the Incubus. The ancestors predicted everything that has happened, and you have a power that could make you stronger than your father. This power also has the ability to control you if you do not master it. Your future is much deeper than your tribe and we know our survival is dependent on you. We have protected your people from outsiders for thousands of years, we need you to defend us from what is now inside our valley... our home. Their lust will not stop on humans and I cannot bare to think of what would become of us if they captured any of my pack. Today you will learn the first lesson on controlling your power.\" The elder wolf communicated before walking outside of his den. \u00a0Rose followed behind the elder wolf to the outside where he was greeted by six wolves of varying breeds and colors. Rose looked the elder wolf who nodded for Rose to go to the other wolves. As Rose moved to the other wolves, they turned around and began to walk off in an arrow formation. A new communication was being formed between Rose and these wolves, one that was discreet and not like the one that connected him with the other wolves. This communication was held only by the hunters and warriors, some Rose would soon be informed on.\"Today we're going for a hunt, but not our normal hunt. Today we are hunting food for the Merosiky boy. Today we are going to hunt a panther for him to feast on. The elder says he needs the blood of a righteous creature with the life of a warrior. This is the only way to ensure he is the one we seek.\" The wolves spoke to each other, excommunication Rose from the conversation.\u00a0A couple hours passed before the wolf pack found themselves in a very wet part of the forests. Pools of stagnant water and buzzing mosquitoes everywhere. The creatures that lurked in these wetlands were hard to spot, especially the hunters from these wetlands. The wolves would follow the solid shore line that had a forestry that eventually turned into a jungle. The wolves were cautious, knowing they were in the territory of a Panther due to the scent markings in the area.\u00a0Instantaneously, the wolves shot into the jungle and hid from Rose to leave him to his hunt. Rose didn't know what was going on, but he assumed he was going to hunt this panther and fight it. It didn't take long before the panther found Rose on the shoreline as the panther crept up a tree that hovered over Rose. Rose was pumping himself up as he looked around while trying to draw on the powers the Darkness offered. So far he had been able t bulk up slightly and change his eyes for better sight, the two things necessary for a hunt. A loud crack was heard above Rose that caused him to jump and roll then look up. A broken limb hit the ground where he stood from the Panthers stepping on a dead branch. The giant cat took a leap from the tree from about 20' in the air with it's front paws towards Rose and the beasts mouth was wide open, revealing all the sharp tools of death inside. Instead of Rose's fear kicking in, he was more aggressive towards the attack just like the Darkness was when the Incubus attack occurred. Rose caught a paw in his hands as the large pushed him backwards. As the two fell over, Rose took his foot and pushed it into the panthers chest as he rolled on back before launching the large cat backwards about five yards. Rose would flip to his feet and stare the beast down. The panther had landed on his feet, but instead of attacking, it decided to circle around with Rose. The panther would hiss and growl, showing it's teeth quite regularly. Eventually Rose started to do it back to the panther. His mouth started out normal, but the more he watched the panthers mouth and heard it's sounds, the more Rose's teeth started to progress into a set much like the Panthers. The claws began to pierce his through his figertips to show themselves.\u00a0Rose was doing his best to be fully confident and his control was showing by being able summon his basic capabilities. It wouldn't be long before his hunger kicked in due to the use of this power and tried to take control. The panther could sense the the disturbance within Rose and waited for the chance to strike. Rose went to reach for his frosted plums and soon realized that he left them in the elder wolfs den. He had to curb this hunger somehow and right now Rose was thinking of killing the Panther to ear it's raw meat. \u00a0When that thought dawned on Rose, a hunters instinct kicked in and pushed the Darkness back into submission. The panther had waited too long and now it's time was up.When Rose came to a halt, so did the panther. It's yellow eyes beat into Rose's like the were already fighting mentally. The panther would swat and Rose would swat the beasts paws as it tried. The opening came along when the panther lifted its upper body into the air to swat down at Rose. The moment the beast was at it's highest, Rose ducked in and sent his left hand directly below the rip cage in an upper hook movement guided by his claws that would rips through the hide and allow him a strong hold. His right took hold of the top of the beasts ribcage and duck his claws in behind the bone. This movement caused the mighty beast to forget the attack and screamed as loud as it could. In the midst of the scream, Rose slammed the panther on its face. When the beasts face hit the ground, Rose's left arm went even deeper into its body while it traveled over the ribs and missed the main organs.\u00a0The panther was out cold and would most likely die if it escaped in the condition it was in. When Rose removed his left arm from the chest of the panther, the creature fell to the ground. The scent of the creatures blood called on him to feast. He knew what his senses and mind was telling him, but something within him was mortified by it. Having no control over his body as it was ready to feast from starvation, his left hand would run across the panthers neck to straighten out the skin. From this point on, Rose blacked out; he was neither Rose nor the Darkness. His teeth extended from his mouth, revealing large and sharp fangs that decorated it. With a slow progression, Rose slid his fangs into the Panthers next as slow as he could so he did not startle the panther. His saliva seemed to nullify the bite, but a quick bite would create shock before the saliva effects kicked in. For the next five minutes Rose feasted on the Panther's blood. When done, the panther had less than half of its blood within itself. The panther was not technically dead at this moment, but it soon would be.\u00a0Rose stood up and wiped the blood from his mouth as he came back to it. He had flicked in and out towards the end of the feasting, but not enough to control it himself; when his hunger was satiated, he would come back to. His features began to subside and Rose returned to normal Rose. The wolves would also returned when he was done with the panther. Nothing was said to Rose as they trailed back to their home, not even among themselves. Rose could sense they respected Rose more, but still not enough to hold a conversation. This left Rose watching and looking at everything as they traveled through the valley to their home. He had never seen such places besides in paintings and he wanted to remember what everything was actually like.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Rose woke when the Sun peeked through cracks in the walls and hit him in the face.

Meeting Rose where he left Rose that morning was the elder wolf. The elder wolf circled around Rose, sniffing him and eyeing him from head to toe. Rose stood still, letting the wolf do whatever it was doing without resistance of any kind.\u00a0\"Did you kill it?\" The elder wolf asked Rose.\"Yes. I broke it's neck, impaled the beasts chest, and drained it of almost all of its blood. I stopped when my hunger was satisfied.\" Rose responded in a voice that sounded ashamed.\"It is good that doing what you did to that beast bothers you. It is bad that you did not drain it of all blood. We must go to my den so that we can talk without being heard.\", The elder wolf spoke as he turned away from Rose and entered his Den.Rose followed behind the elder wolf and sat where he slept the night before, \"What is it? There is no way that panther survived.\"\"Child, your powers are not that simple. It is great that you could control your hunger, but that is a decision you will have to make each time you feast. If you do not drain them of all their blood, they will survive, and come back as a vampire. We have hid this from your people because we hoped you would never have to deal with, but the Darkness has a way of crafting paths that it doesn't share with us. I do not doubt you can control your hunger, but the panther might not be able to. You will have to hunt this beast down and decide whether to kill or control this panther. That panther would be able to wipe out a large portion of our pack if it attacked us in the night. You can rest tonight because it will need to heal, but when the sun rises, you will have to leave... alone.\" The elder wolf spoke to Rose over the small fire between them.Rose lowered his head, \"I do not want to kill it, there was something odd about it. Maybe I can connect to it like I have with you. The beasts of this world should not suffer like the my kind. The animals are natures children, having deeper bonds with them. Maybe that panther has been why nobody has made it through the jungle? There has to be a reason this panther was so easily found and defeated... If I fail at saving this beast, how would I kill it?\"\"Remove the heart or head. These are the only things that can kill this beast. You will have the advantage in the daytime since it will be hiding from resting for the nightly hunt. Until this panther is dealt with, you can not return one you leave. For the time being, I will leave to eat my share of the kill today. A hungry or feeding wolf does not think, so please stay here while we eat.\", the wolf spoke as he stood back up and left his den.Rose remained in the den by himself and decided to sleep. In his sleep, he dreamed of hunting the forest with a wolf and his father. The boy was full of good thoughts and feelings when he was in this valley, continuously pushing the bad memories even further into the back of his mind. The less he angry or fearful he was, the more control over his Darkness he had.

The sound from the trees being turned into a raft parts would echo through the valley forests and carried down the river. In the far distance, a scouting pack of wolves heard the noise. They were one their way to investigate the noise.On the other side of the small river was group of jet black humans with spears and two panthers. These creatures and people hid within the thick shrubbery of the jungle, watching The Enlightened One rip the trees from the ground without breaking a sweat. These beings marveled at his strength, noting that he was to be respected like a predator, but also treated like a predator in their territory.The Enlightened One had wasted daylight and strength by building a raft instead of looking for a shallow spot for carts to cross. A narrow six foot wide stone pathway had been created by terramancers that was one foot below the water to hide it. The stone pathway also stood as a defense to prevent most boats from coming down the river through the Azoni valley.When The Enlightened One and his side kick began to cross the river, the jungle group took off to tell their others of the arrival. On the side they had just left, a pack of six brown and white Dire Wolves lined the shore that the group just left. A loud howl was raised to the Crescent moon that was peeking through the red skies of the sunset. The howl was a signal to their master pack and a warning to The Enlightened One if he crossed back over the river. Until the two foreigners were gone, the wolves would watch them.When the party reached the other side, they would see only one passageway through the jungles\u00a0that was just starting to be overgrown from no travel for a month. Night was less than fifteen minutes away and the red skies were quickly turning purple and black, some stars already twinkling in the sky. The sounds of the creatures within this jungle became noticeable; some sounded mighty while others were just song and chatter.\u00a0The two beings would still have to decide between camping or continuing. The jungle was black when with it's confines. Fall did not bother these plants like they did the other trees mainly because it was at least twenty degrees warmer on the outskirts of the jungle. Humidity was a huge factor here as it rained often in the jungle and misted in the forests most of the time. \u00a0With it's own atmosphere, this jungle thrived on the mountain side it rested on._________________________________________________________________________________________________________To Ayzum:The Azoni Temple is an hour away from the Azoni tribe.

This temple, like the tribe, was controlled by the Incubus and Succubus, preaching their horrid beliefs in the disguise of the Holy.Religion comes and goes, but the beauty of this temple is forever. It is crafted of crystals and black marble. This temple was a source of magic and knowledge since it was the religious center and the library of the Azoni Valley. This place was home to many orphans and mages, and ran off of volunteer work. It is currently filled with Incubus and Succubus, but the secrets it holds have not been revealed to the blasphemous creations of the Holy.Inside the Azoni TempleThe inside of the Azoni Temple is massive, carving into the entire mountain like a city. Massive blank faced structures stood throughout the entire temple with the belief that these statues were guardians. Due to their blank slate, no religion has ruined them since they could be used for anything, such as angels.

What happened earlier was over food and not a direct attack. After so much time had passed, the natives would begin moving deeper into the cave that was an entrance to their home.A mile inside the cave an opening was present. When the group reached the opening, they would see a village carved out of the stones. Their age was unknown, but the deterioration hinted at the ancient age of these structures. There were more of these openings throughout the mountain, but this was the only one The Enlightened One and the Bishop would enter.\u00a0Leading the two to a a structure that was connected to the ground and ceiling of the opening, the Pride was watched as they brought Outsiders to their home. When there, the two were shown to a room that had a bed of cloths for them to rest in. The rest of the pride would continue on to others rooms in the structure while two remained behind with The Enlightened One and the Bishop.\"Please rest. Daylight is only a short time away. We all have important tasks on us tomorrow.\" A native spoke to the two before he closed he shifted into a panther and rested at the entrance of their room.When morning came around, a white panther came to the room and woke the two, \"We have prepared you a meal.\"\u00a0When the two were ready, the panthers and Team Enlightened would follow the white panther to what looked like a respectable beings room. \u00a0Three chairs sat at a small table that was \u00a0covered with meats and tropical fruits. As the two would take their seat, a door opened up and out came a tall, broad shouldered, humanoid with black panther attributes. The creature stood 7'6\" in height and weighed a hefty 340 pounds that consisted of marbleized black muscle. Around his neck, wrists, ankles, and anywhere else it could hang, was golden jewelry and ornaments that decorated his black form. \u00a0 \u00a0\"Please, enjoy this meal.

The remainder of the meal Halu-Kohas remained quiet. When he was finished, he waited for the others to finish their meal before he would stand and invite them to follow him into his office. When they were inside, they would take notice of the fine quality weapons and jewelry that decorated the walls. Vines clung to the walls, maneuvering and twisting around the weapons, showing the rooms age. A small desk was present with nothing on it or in it. They had no use for paperwork, so the desk was more for show.Halu-Kohas reached beneath the desk and pulled out two maps. One map was their jungles and the other was the forests.

These mounts were able to carry their weapons plus a few extra weapons that were always carried by them(daggers, two sabers, and one short spear).A third mount arrived that had no armor but was much larger than the other two.

Gitmo was not in a good mood, at all. His fist was clenched, his teeth breaching his lips in order to convey a toothy, primal rage. Anger swept over him, overwhelming and crashing like the waterfall he was sheltered underneath. He needed to release his rage. He needed something to destroy, smash, wreck, SOMETHING! He couldn't stand being stuck here for much longer. He felt cooped up, stuck, despairing. He hated that. Despised that. He needed some form of action, some way to get back at the demons which alone got him and those also, in this predicament.His eyes flashed over the frightened faces of the ones who had fled with him. They hadn't helped him at all, except for a spare few, when he escorted them to this hiding spot, away from the fierce predators outside. It pissed him off. They should fight. All of them. Adult or child. Man or woman. It didn't matter. Taking up the sword, or the bow wasn't determined by what you are, but what you believe in. He could fight, and he would fight even if he didn't know how! But they don't. Because of their cowardice. His anger, was increased twofold, amplifying itself against the deafening nature of the waterfall.\"Bloody hell.\"He lent himself against the stone wall, cold and damp. The spray caught itself upon his cost, the millionth time. He huffed once again, exhaling with force. Any excuse to get out of here would be wonderful. Else he might explode.
