The Inn is fairly huge, consisting of a main building flanked by a row of bunkhouses and complete with a small port used for independent trade with river going merchants. The main room is expansive and always full of customers, many with large purses and larger egos, although the bar does cater to the rabble with its less expensive drinks. The melodic tunes of a master lute player, obviously well-paid, ring throughout the room, still audible over all the cacophony of the patrons. The barmaids are dressed well yet provocatively, and all the staff is well-spoken. The rooms above the main room are used as temporary residence by those escaping the cold of night. There is also a single hatched entrance to a below-ground room behind the bar, presumably a cellar, though no non-staff are allowed to pass. Despite only having opened a few years ago, it's becoming relatively well-known, after the noble owner renovated the buildings using his considerable inheritance, although with its success there has been a consequent rise in highwayman activity around the nearby towns. The Inn's most recent owner, Ulfang von Haren, does nothing to stop these robbings, however, claiming that it is his responsibilities to serve his guests, not defend them from bandits, although he does also offer mercenary protection to those who are feeling too uneasy about their travels...for a price. Despite the bandits, the Inn remains in business and untouched by the criminals, very likely due to the owner's bearish appearance.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i61.tinypic.com/ifnbbk.jpg"], "html": "<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://i61.tinypic.com/ifnbbk.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/></p>"}, "post-4886": {"user": "Skarlet", "user_num": 257, "timestamp": "1435465135000", "message": "Skarlet enters the inn alone, Pilar and Royal were elsewhere.

Against this backdrop, a massive, strong-featured man with long, snow white hair dressed in a thick hide overcoat and leather jerkin who sits at a table near the back corner, surveying the entire room seems slightly out of place. His one good pale yellow eye instantly locks onto the vampire when she enters, and he stands, slowly making his way through the crowd toward Skarlet, the people parting as he nears as if by his command. The woman had an aura about her. One he had seen before, but not for a long time. A dark one, as they called them in his homeland. Blood-drinkers, black hunters, Nightstalkers. They were stuff of legend. Ulfang had never seen one up close -- he had only ever caught glimpses of the characteristic lack of light they carry with them...until, perhaps, now.He sits beside Skarlet and gives her a small grin. \"Good evening,\" he greets, his deep, normally intimidating tones touched by a convincing friendliness. \"I have not seen you around before, Miss. I know all of my regular patrons, and you are not regular. May I offer you a drink? Our ales are the finest in the Kingdom...though at a glance you appear to be more of a...bloodwine lady, yes?
