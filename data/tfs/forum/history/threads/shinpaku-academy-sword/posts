It had one practical use: strength and swing training. He raised both arms above his head, each bokken held tightly and with near-perfect form. Then, he swung them down towards the ground, stopping only an inch above the tatami.\"Too slow!\"Hideki took in a deep breath, then relaxed his posture and wiped sweat from his brow. He was blind, yet he had no trouble finding the space upon the floor where he was permitted to sit and did so without waiting for it.\"Father, I must rest for a little while,\" Hideki told the elderly man, who sat on the opposite side of the room with his legs crossed and a sword over his knee.\"There is no time for resting on the battlefield, Hideki. Still, I will allow you to take several minutes to regain your strength.\"\"You need not lecture me. I am master of this school, remember. Chosen by your hand upon your retirement. I am more than skilled to lead this academy,\" Hideki replied, his eyes closed. \"Perhaps. You are not yet as skilled as me in the same techniques, however,\" his father explained. \"Your skill with fighting without eyes is beyond the comprehension of most warriors and your Ittou Jougen is feared by many, but there are still secret techniques for you to master.\"\"Secret techniques? I see, so this is why you still attend to my personal training despite your retirement. You have never mentioned this before.\"\"You are master enough to hold the title, but you have not yet surpassed me. No true father can retire until his son overtakes him in his chosen profession. One day you will learn this, when you have children of your own.\"Hideki stood again and took up his position in the centre of the room. He raised both suburito up above his head, then took in a deep breath.\"Now strike!\" The elder ordered, with which Hideki complied. \"Your sword must be faster, your muscles stronger, your skill unequalled. Not until your strike reaches your enemy before the sound of your blade can you truly be legend.\"Hideki struck the air above the ground again and again.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"Too slow.\""}}
