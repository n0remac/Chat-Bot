No birds sing serenely from the tapestry of branches; neither do insects flutter and buzz nor animals rustle through its mazing trails. Flowers and berries refuse to grow and any wildlife forced in are never seen again. Such mysterious events have made its moniker well-deserved and the subject of superstition and attraction from strangers.\u00a0The surrounding villages hold the land is cursed because the trees appear impervious to flame or ax. Tales of demons and ghosts differ from person to person except for one consistency: many individuals claim to have witnessed a woman in white skirting the forest edge while singing an alluring lullaby. Spotters call her beautiful and having long black hair as she roams searching for those she may lure to their doom. Some say she wanders the villages at night and takes those she finds breaking the curfew. However no irrefutable proof of her existence has yet been documented. \u00a0Stories of the woman have brought thrillseekers and skeptics alike to challenge themselves into spending the night within the Silent Forest in hope to catch a glimpse of her. They either return disappointed or not at all. \u00a0So goes the urban legend of The White Siren whose song beckons the listener to death.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/vKOo9Dc.jpg?1"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><b><font size=\"5\"><br><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/vKOo9Dc.jpg?1\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/><br/><br/>The Silent Forest\u00a0</br></font></b></div>"}, "post-36877": {"user": "Dr. Anton Bartlett", "user_num": 1436, "timestamp": "1462743348000", "message": "His gut told him that taking the left at the fork wouldn't get him to the next town, but Lavi didn't listen.
