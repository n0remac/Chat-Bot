A reaper of souls over the battlefield. Those who had dared to go against his troops had paid the price dearly during his campaigns. He had even been given the title of \"Butcher\" by some who had dared to cross his fleet in the olden days. On the battlefield or on the sea, he could contend with whatever threat came his way. It was where the Baron had thrived for some years when he rose through the ranks. It was where he needed to be most of all. Ordering the deaths of men that served not only him but more importantly his enemies. But now.....\"What are you doing?! Get those posts up faster or I'll have you flogged!\" The snarled tone of the Admiral could be heard as he eyed the two men who were struggling to use a hammer and nail for a simple job of constructing a wooden fence line. The perimeter in question was meant to be used for farmland when the area was more secure. In truth, he knew that growing vegetables this close to the sea would be detrimental to the growth. The salt in the air was bound to affect the farmland. But they needed to start somewhere. Some of his men had grumbled about growing a garden when they should have been reaving instead. The Admiral had set them straight with a stern talking too. They had left Venland for this. The chance to not destroy......but to grow. It was a rare opportunity and one that Emeric intended to take. For if he was out here then this colonization would be done under his terms.The commander was sat atop of his horse while he inspected the process with which his men were moving. His gaze flickering from the grassy plains back to the shoreline where his ships were sat. The four dozen ships were not his preferred choice but in truth this was a necessity. Venland had needed to expand. And they had to come heavy with their supplies for this venture. Food, medicine, weapons and whatever else that they could have taken from their nation's offering hand before they departed. Emeric leaned back on his horse while just examining it all. There was too much that needed to be done. When it came to sailing on the seas, all he had to worry about was the tide and any rocky coves. Even the fog was a bother. But this felt all the more different. This was something else.And with his saber sheathed on his belt, the Admiral would close his eyes and listen to the sounds of the world around him. His men who were working on establishing the perimeter just in front of the treeline that was beyond his encampment. The sound of supplies being brought off the ships and even the mild cursing that could be heard between his crewmen. But more importantly, Emeric listened to the sound of the water crashing into one another on that sea. It did calm him so.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Admiral Emeric Ullrich was a great many things. A commander of men. A reaper of souls over the battlefield.

He had brought with him a nameless Rune-Skaald who was also a seeress. She was old, and they simply called her \"Norna\". There was a younger Skaald as well, though he possessed none of the magical talents of the Seeress. Then there were the men. Robust, bearded, generally fair haired and eyed. Some clad in ring-mail, others in studded leather. Many had furred cloaks, and they carried bearded axes, single and double edged swords of both the short, long, and great variety, spears, and shields. As well as a few archers too boot. What was strange was there was also women and children aboard. The families of the men, they had brought them in their voyage. But for what purpose? Why would these men bring their families to war? Perhaps it was because they were not seeking one, despite their militant-appearences. They came in a small but impressive fleet of long-boats, the head of a wolf carved in their wooden prows, as runic-markings marred the enchanted wood of the boats. They would be recognized clearly by the style of the boat, and the men. Fighting between the two factions was not unheard of, but it was also very rare, and it was typically not without a damn good reason. The small band of hardened warriors should have posed a familiar sight to the men working about. The boats moved up the Fjord, about four of them in total. Fenris was the first to get out as he looked at the settlement a small grin on his face and a glint in his eye as if he was immensely pleased with what he saw. He walked towards Ullrich as if he knew exactly who to seek. He heard the crashing of the waves and appreciated them, though perhaps not so much as Ullrich a man born and bred for the sea. Fenris was more than comfortable in the water, but he preferred terra-firma more often than not. \"Hail!\" he raised a hand to Ullrich. His men were behind him along with the two-Skaalds. \"I have come from Norland, and have of your noble-endeavor.\" he said. \"I wish to help you.\" he continued simply. \"I have brought a 1/3rd of my men with me here, because they seek a new-life and many are growing old and can no longer go on raids.\" he told the Admiral. \"They will stay here and work with your men, and serve as this settlements defenders eh?\" he asked. He did not see why Ullrich would refuse, unless for the sheer fact he had no idea who Fenris was.

The cries of the crewmen from those 'wolf ships' were bound to echo in the distance. Their ships were certainly a concern. Enemies? Or something else? A scout had arrived running up to him panting and red faced about the ships that were coming into dock on their shoreline. His head had already turned to face the water as he then saw the wolf head that was used on those prows. With a grunt, he would reach into his satchel to pull out his spy glass and raise it up to his eye to inspect these new arrivals. And from what he saw, these were no war vessels. Not if they had women and children. Were they vessels meant to transport refugees? Or were they headed for a specific location that was not here? That was when he realized just who this 'fleet' belonged too and he couldn't help but grunt in derision. They were his fellow countrymen no doubt. Emeric grimaced as he lowered his spy glass and turned back to the scout. Orders were quietly given to ascertain the situation of these new arrivals and see about getting their men to work. If a Northerner couldn't take an order from a Southerner, there might be a problem. With his head turning back to observe the work of his men for a final time, he would turn his horse around and head back for the shoreline. To run into someone who was in charge of the fleet no doubt.\"Hail, good sir.\" His voice was certainly deep and he sounded the words out slowly as he approached the other while on horseback. Already he was assessing this man who had arrived with men, women, and children to this colonization. There was no smile on the Admiral's face but he doubted the other would care. No. Emeric was a man of seriousness when it came to his work. The offer for help certainly raised his eyebrows just a tad as he stared down the man as he came with an offer of protection for this area. For a brief moment, Emeric wanted to decline and send the younger man and his entourage packing. But......\"Uniting our two defending groups would be best, I suppose.\" The man muttered as he raised a canteen up to his lips. A large gulp would be had as it was consumed by the admiral. The canteen would be lowered as the alcoholic beverage did its trick. \"Your old I can have understood. But the women and children you brought....\" His head shakes as he looked to the men behind Fenris. Along with the two Skaalds. No. He was content to men being under his command. With that, he knew they would die with honor. Even women who were warriors had that honor as well. But children? No. Emeric liked it little. \"We don't know what's out here. We could find war tribes or worse. If they stay then they had best be ready in the event we are attacked. Not only that, everyone must contribute in this endeavor. I will have no one not contributing to the construction of this colony.\"He turns back once more to face the work that was being done. \"Lieutenant!\" He barked out for his underling as he pointed outward then to beyond the plains. \"I want a group of men put together to start cutting down the treeline! We're going to need more wood than what we have. Also see about a scouting party to go up ahead.\" The perimeter would need to be expanded upon. Siege lines could be made with wooden spears thrust into the ground for any that might try to attack them. It would make the endeavor all that much harder and give them more time to prepare for any attack. \"I assume you've brought more supplies from Norland? Food will need to be rationed in the event we can't procure more.\" He would turn to face the northerner with that calm expression once more. They were much different. North and South. And yet, with this endeavor, perhaps they could move beyond the old differences that were between their people.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "He had heard them upon their arrival.

Though this was a different endeavor, Fenris felt it deserved the same respect as a battle in the halls of their history. \"You should be remembered, and the Skaalds shall assure that.\" he told him. The man seemed huffy to say the least. \"The women can work alongside the men... I thought this would be obvious... And any children over 12 can do what they can too aid.\" he said. It was not like there were many. He looked at some of his men, as Ulrrich ordered a scouting party. He looked at Ulrrich. \"Forgive me, but I would like to already begin contributing, I would send my men out with yours, as you know your men are skilled at open-warfare but we northerners are more comfortable in the wilderness.\" and if Ulrich aquiesced Fenris would send a small scouting party out as well, while others began to join the other sentry. \"Of course I brought extra-supplies.\" he said as if anything else would be mad. \"We can start unloading them now if you wish...

The first of settlers had been here for about a week, so the more civilized looking Midlanders would probably know more than the Norlanders.
