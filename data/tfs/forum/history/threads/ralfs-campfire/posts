Grunting, he heaved himself up and cleared the sleep from his eyes, yawning as he did so.  The embers from his fire were still smoldering, so he shoveled some cold dirt over them to extinguish the flames for good.  He stood up, stretching once again, and began to reequip himself.A steel sword, for combat, was sheathed on his back.  Joining it was another sword, somewhat longer and heavier, and definitely older; it was his ancestral blade, a weapon belonging to the Valgards for many centuries.  He holstered his hand-axe on his belt, slung his quiver and bow over his shoulder, and then gripped his Hirhanic shield with his left hand.  It was a heavy load for sure, especially with his mail armor, but the Varan warrior was well-conditioned for such travel.  Still, he would have preferred a horse to assist with the load.He continued his journey down the road, which ran south out of Asgeir and then cut southwestward as it connected to the rest of the Overworld.  It was a popular route for merchants and traders, connecting the northern realms with the east, south, and west.  It was a fine place to meet up with other travelers, adventurers, and wanderers.A few hours into his journey Ralf would hear a commotion ahead.  He observed the sound of a horse... a galloping horse, or several, and then - a scream!Without hesitation the Varan warrior darted off the road to the nearby trees.  He wanted to observe what was happening first before joining a conflict.  He didn't have to wait long as a blue-skinned creature came riding forth upon her strange mount.\"Rani?\"  He wasn't sure if it was her or not; the mount was moving to quickly and the commotion behind them distracted the northman from getting a good look, but he at least recognized it as a troll.Acting quickly, Ralf charged from his hiding place, drawing his hand-axe and throwing it with great precision at one of the bandits.  The wedged head embedded itself into the back of his target and he toppled off.  The man had little time to react as Ralf drove his steel sword into the man's gut.  Collecting his axe, the Varan warrior quickly mounted the deceased rider's horse and chased after the troll and other bandits.\"Oi, troll!  You're not alone in this fight!\"(Rani)", "link_list": ["/user/399"], "image_list": [], "html": "Ralf opened his cold blue eyes in the early morning haze.

She dextrously catches a hold of a higher branch and while up and turns to send magic into the ground, a shockwave cracks through the ground and a pillar of rock bursts forth from the earth that makes the bandit's horse trip and fall over. Rani now sits atop the branch and looks over the crippled horse and it's fallen rider. \"Take ya'self and leave now and I'll stop Uzi, reach for your weapon though ye cannot be saved.\" Rani called down to the bandit, right next to him now was Uzi the Scar Raptor, his rows of dagger teeth inches from the man's face. Uzi hisses and squeals inquisitively, Uzi couldn't actually see the man as he was in his blindspot directly in front of his mouth as his eyes are far out from the sides of his head, similar to a hammerhead shark's but a Scar Raptors eyes faced forward a little more. Uzi looks for his prey but only see's his owner, soon though the bandit reaches for his crossbow and Uzi finally notices him and snaps his jaws into the man's neck with the speed of a hungry hungry hippo.Well now Rani didn't need to feed her steed.
