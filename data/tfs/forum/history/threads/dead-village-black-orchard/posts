A miasma of death clogged the air, from the tall piles of half decayed corpses with flaked skin and seeping, congealed fat to great smoke stacks rising into the air like the obsidian fist of Death himself from the grim pyres constructed by the damned fools who attempted to halt the infection by incinerating the corpses before being reaped by the sickness themselves. Aurelian inhaled the foulness. Wonderful. A perfect place to put his delicate schemes into motion.

There, stood the pale figure of a man frantically dissecting a plague corpse. Whatever color his clothing may have been prior to the outbreak, it had now taken the rancid hues of dark blood and thick pus. Aurelian announced his presence with a loud cough, prompting the man to whirl about. The Elven Sorcerer saw the madness present in his eyes.\u00a0\"Who are you?\" He demanded.\"A friend.\" Responded Aurelian simply.\u00a0Dark eyes ringed with purple tiredness narrowed in suspicion. Humming a melodic tune to himself, Aurelian searched the space around himself, eyes drawn to thin parchment scribbled with various notes.\"Ah-h-h... attempting to cure the plague, become the savior of your little quaint village?\"\u00a0\"What does it matter? I-..I failed.\"\"Ah, but to the contrary!\" Aurelian gestured to the notes. \"What is desperation but the heart of innovation?
