The wood is soft and rotted with age, but it still stands. Beside the pier is a brass bell hanging from a tree. It's tarnished from exposure and lack of maintenance, but will still ring clearly if struck. There are many local superstitions about this pier, most of them conflicting. Fishing off of it will bring great luck, according to some. According to others, you'll pull nothing but mud and boots if you cast a line off the pier. Some say there are women in the lake handing out swords. However, these swords do not signify political power in any way. Others will tell you that ghostly figures come to the pier at night, to fish and swim. However, if there's one superstition that the locals agree on, it's to never touch the bell. No good can come of ringing it, they say. In fact, they're so afraid of ringing it that they're unable to take it down.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/UPU9nmj.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/UPU9nmj.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/></div>"}, "post-68043": {"user": null, "user_num": null, "timestamp": "1495658838000", "message": "From the thick foliage surrounding the lag came the slashing of plant matter and the glint of a thick sword, followed by a woman not even three feet tall.\"Ha HAH!\"  She suddenly cried out.
