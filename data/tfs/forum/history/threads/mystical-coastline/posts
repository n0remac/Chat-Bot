He doesn't want to wake her, but he used to starting early. Discipline and desire war within him for a few minutes before he makes up his mind. It wouldn't hurt to sleep in one day. Settling in just a bit deeper and holding her just a bit tighter he once again closes his eyes."}, "post-38593": {"user": "Moonflower L\u00e0idir", "user_num": 1010, "timestamp": "1463724759000", "message": "Moon was so exhausted that she didn't even feel Mihael wake, despite usually being a very light sleeper.
