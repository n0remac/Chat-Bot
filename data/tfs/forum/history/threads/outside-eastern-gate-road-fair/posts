The circus master knew well, so they did as instructed and moved off the road near the eastern gates of the city. With their place chosen and the caravan now off the road, it was time to set up! Cast up the tents, raise the booths and games! Prepare the arena for the shows! Cooks were already preparing their traveling kitchens - the acrobats smoothing out their flamboyant suits - the handlers were grooming the varying animals tamed for the shows. By late afternoon, as the sun was on the descent and painting the sky in fire, the flags atop the colorful tents and stalls were flying in the breeze - come morning the place would open to any and all. But for now, for the night, excited workers from the troope would run the streets of Isra to decorate the streets in flyers - it would be a grand festival!Come the morning, there would be a number of games to play, sights to see, wonders to behold! Exotic animals from far off places, doing awe-inspiring tricks as they worked with their handlers as if they were born friends rather than two completely different species! Dancing bears, leaping tigers and flittering hawks - oh, my. And the sword dancers, and fire spitters! Jugglers and jesters all about! A myriad of smells from freshly baked goods would settle over the fair - delectable pastries and succulent meats for sale~ Far to the back would be the roughly erected arena - a wide, rounded corral circled by a number of ascending benches for guests to watch the shows at a safe distance.
