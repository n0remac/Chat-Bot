All heat had been drawn from the original storm by multiple beings and the ashen clouds dispersing. As the ashen clouds vanished, a bright light could be seen between the cracks from above. Soon enough, with the dismissal of one storm, another had been brewing.\u00a0The spiraling vortex of flames that had continued to draw on power from multiple sources was added a new source of energy to recycle that would soon be supported by other sources. The fire storm would cast a bright light that cast it's gold and red hues across the lands. As all light does, when what light returned from the surface had not been absorbed by the elements themselves, it would absorb this light to add a small return of energy to focus into what magic it had in works.\u00a0With the fire storm above producing a centralized warm front, the cool front released from Trogdor's storm would collide with it. The two fronts would take separate paths; the warm front was pushed upwards and the cold front under it. To make it worse, with both fronts carry heaving wind speeds, it make things even worse.With such a rapid punch to the centralized warm front in a complete 360, Supercell conditions were made plausible. The moment the fronts collide, red bolts of fire split the sky open, but never left the skies. A deafening boom occurred \u00a0immediately after it that shook the grounds. The firestorm above seemed to begin forming into a mushroom like figure. Within moments Trogdor himself was once again hidden, but in the midst of a fire cloud.\u00a0To replace the water that would naturally be needed to form your typical Supercell, the firestorm used itself, allowing nature to take control of it's figure. Quickly the firestorm unfolded into what would soon become a Supercell Firestorm. Despite not being fully formed, the weather on the ground and lower skies would drastically change.The first thing was the increase in light that was being dispersed. Sacrificing the energy absorbing capability from heat, it's light gathering increased. With the unadaultered sunlight from above and it's reflection on the ground, it would definitely be able keep a steady charge, neither gaining or losing energy. Using mother nature as the crutch took a lot of slack off the magic usage needed to form this storm.The winds on the ground would find themselves blowing at about eighty mph. As the storm grew, the winds would grow also. These winds were very warm due to the fire clouds above heating it. As time went, the wind would get hotter as the speed increased, making it feel like one was travelling through a desert without water.Through it all, the 'Sun' still kept focusing energy into Trogdor in one way or another. Since the 'Sun' could not directly continue to focus it's energy into Trogdor, it worked itself around that. The 'Sun' as the core of this storm, would focus the hottest fires on Trogdor, meaning high magic force involved. As Trogdor is known to do, this fire would continue to fuel him and boost his capability.\u00a0\"When this storm is complete, we will become one... They will be at our mercy.\" The 'Sun' communicated into Trogdor's mind.\u00a0(Just a lot more fire instead of clouds.
