I lived there with my mother and 12 siblings, I lived in the basement of her hovel and sometimes I would get in trouble for accidentally setting things on fire. I always went out to hunt with the other Kobolds my age to bring food back home to my family, enduring ridicule from my peers because I was a smartass. I was a different Kobold then, immature and cocky with a loose set of morals. I always insulted the other Kobolds when they came up with a stupid plan, then they'd beat me. One time I was struck in my leg with a crossbow, I was always fine of course. They just attacked me to try to teach me a lesson. My first good deed towards a stranger was when a human came wandering through, at first I threatened him with my magic, but he was in awe of me and gave me compliments. I decided I would let him live because he was nice to me and shared some sweet bread. The other Kobolds came along soon enough and they questioned me, why wasn't I killing this human, it would be good food. I told them he was my slave and I would not allow harm to come to him.\"Doobie laughs thinking back to that. \"I left that place when I was 2 years old. I was tired of living there, and though I had left my mother and siblings behind, I knew they would be fine. They would soon be old enough to fend for themselves like me. I haven't gone back there since. \"The first place I went to was a desert, the Valheecius desert of Phoenix State. I was almost eaten by a giant worm when i was rescued by Zaltos Kiraxo and one of his companions. I later found out that Zaltos was the Pharaoh of that land and that he wasn't even a human, he was a Phoenix that had taken human form. I learned many things about magic while traveling with him and I genuinely had fun. We eventually encountered Purge, king of the Ethereal Realm. He invited us to his realm to have dinner, we just had to fight our way through a chasm full of monsters first, which was no problem. We were smoking some strange herb, it was pleasing, while doing so and passing through the chasm, I turned a monster inside out through it's anus with one of my spells. Kekekekeke.\"\"So I've been to this place that you've been to, at a different time. I didn't have nearly as bad of a time there though. I met a good friend named Jun, and we're still great friends. I encounter her occasionally and join her on adventures. At that time I was going through a phase, I was very moody and upset all the time, but it was at this point I got great stylish clothes for myself and discovered Starman! A year later I met Xochiquetzal, my love!\"Doobie kisses Xochi and finishes his story, \"There are more adventures, involving Stand Users I've met, but for now let's eat!\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"No. My stand is a rare case.
