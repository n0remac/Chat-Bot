But, if they knew the way, or simply wandered long enough, they would eventually emerge onto a street remarkably similar to one of the many cobble-flagged main promenades, in but one regard - it leads to nowhere at either end.An early construction, this particular street was abandoned when a mismatch in the plans was discovered, rendering the construction far off the beaten path. As the city expanded, it crept up to the lonely road, buildings swirling around the edge of the stone like wild beasts circling a traveller\u2019s campfire. Traders set up stalls in the middle, bars squabbled over patrons at the rim,  merchants plied their wares throughout, and eventually, this lonely derelict became the center of the underlife of the city.A sort of Grand Bazaar serving the poor, the criminal, the privacy-seeking, and the morality-free, this area became known simply as the Nexus - so named for the fact that all of the city\u2019s alleyways seemed to eventually run back into it, orbiting around this central mass of debauchery. At the present day, the street is a maelstrom of exotic smells wafting from the food vendors, sounds of shouting and haggling from the shoppers, and drunken songs and soft lighting spilling out of the bars and brothels rimming the strip. At night, floating orbs in all colors of the rainbow cast a kaleidoscopic glow over the people beneath.At the middle of the Nexus stands a rather new-looking building, set apart from its fellows by the quality of its construction, and the immaculate aesthetic that it presents. As the door opens, disgorging a happy-looking patron, laughter and music sound a fanfare to his departure. The air that escapes smells of spices and mystery, fine liquor and well-used cards, love and lust and seduction. This establishment, standing over the Nexus like a queen over her subjects, is the Midnight Sun. Its doors never close, for the sun never sets on debauchery.If a traveller were to enter, they would find themselves in the main bar area - a large rectangular room, extending upwards some three stories to touch the feet of the figures in an exquisite mural. At the second-floor level, wide balconies with ornately carved wooden banisters and railings line the left and right sides. The right-hand balcony is reserved for favored patrons, and contains high-backed booths with plush benches. Runic arrays inside the benches ensure that the conversations held in them remain confidential.The main floor is covered with round tables and ringed with booths, except for a cleared area in front of a small stage located at the back of the room. On the left side of the room stands the centerpiece of the whole establishment: the bar. Ornate stools belly up to a thick slab of mirror-finished ebony, hewn from a single tree, that runs almost the entire length of the building. Bottles of every possible shape and size fill shelves that tower up to the ceiling. Bartenders dressed in immaculate white suits bustle about behind it, attending to the unquenchable thirsts of the patrons.On the main floor, serving girls flit between tables, ferrying liquid pleasure and liquid ruin to their requesters. At one table, a group of landed gentry are holding a rousing discussion on the proper method of taxing trade. At another, a group of wealthy-seeming men are relaxing in the arms of stunningly -and in one case, scantily- dressed women with orange gems prominently displayed on silver bracelets.To the left, the bar falls away into another large room. From it, the clink of tokens and the swish of cards being dealt mingle with exultant cries and despondent groans. Sharply-dressed employees in black suits deal red-backed cards onto rich green felt. Patrons cluster around gaming tables. At the side of the room, a woman exits a doorway, a heavy leather bag clutched in her hand. A very remarkable and strangely indistinct gentleperson waves goodbye to her from inside the office. On the desk in front of him, a bottle glows faintly.At the far end of the bar, a wide set of stairs, accessible from the casino or the main floor, winds its way up into the building. Behind it on the ground floor, a door marked \u201cEmployees Only\u201d stands vigil at the head of the stairway to the basement. The second floor contains rooms and suites, suitable for rest, privacy, or engagements of a more carnal nature. A balcony over the bar provides access to a set of hallways serving the rooms, and an out-of-the-way location with a few tables, frequented by those desiring less proximal clamor.Any average patron making their way to the third floor would likely turn right around and head back downstairs. A long hallway sits at the top of the stairs, the dark, rich woods of its construction sheathed in plush red carpet, and hung with tapestries and paintings. The roar of the crowd below is but a dull murmur here, like distant waves crashing on the beach. Silver doorknobs dot the walls at long intervals. Those who come here uninvited quickly gain an uncomfortable sense that they do not belong here. These are the offices - the nerve center of the Midnight Sun.At the right of the main room, a set of soundproofed double doors leads to the inn. The roar of the bar dies away as one enters, giving rise to a more comfortable and secure atmosphere. Immediately to the left of the doors, the inn\u2019s main desk changes the currencies of the lands into Midnight Sun tokens and handles room reservations. Homey square tables fill the center of the room. At the back, a twin set of doors leads to the kitchen. To the right of the desk, a staircase leads to the second and third level - the rooms. These hallways are clad in warm-colored woods and rich red carpets. At intervals, brass doorknobs mark the entrances to the rooms. The interiors are well-appointed, but not richly so. Their general quality is higher than that of the rooms over the bar, as befits their respective purposes.There are many other rooms in the building, of course, serving myriad purposes. Those, the general public will likely never know about.[========================================================]The Midnight Sun uses a unique currency, called Midnight Sun Tokens. These coins come in four denominations, each one increasing by a magnitude of ten. In order of least to most valuable, they are called Moons, Suns, Eclipses, and Novas. Only these tokens are accepted as payment for extra services within the Midnight Sun, with the one exception being the bar. At the front desk, one may speak with the exchange clerk to exchange anything of value for Midnight Sun Tokens, including other currencies, jewelry, and solid metal. Exchange is also possible in the other direction, one may exchange tokens for the major currencies of the world. The exchange rate is reasonable, and if one were to do the math, they would find the services fairly priced.For purposes of cost estimation, one Moon may be considered approximately equal to 1 USD. One Sun is approximately equal to 10 USD, etc.[========================================================]Patron Menu- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Specialty Beverages- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Heartbreak - Our signature beverage!

The room inside was completely empty except for a few unlit candles. Grandma then turned back to the door and closed it, and bolted it shut. The only light in the room came from her staff with its pale light that danced across the walls of the room.Placing her hand on the orb part of the staff, Grandma then moved her hand away from it, and something went through the orb and followed her hand. The staff still created light, but it seemed just a bit dimmer. Placing her hand that had the strange pale orb in it near her mouth, she inhaled it and gave a sigh of happiness. For just a second her form seemed to destort and grow slightly, but then everything was back to normal.\"Well, now that was an especially enjoyable one,\" she mused to herself. \"But alas, I must get back to buisness.\"Reaching into a hidden pocket in her dress, she withdrew an obsidian stone with many detailed runes inscribed on it. She raised it up so that she was looking at it, after just a moment of this, the runes on the stone began to glow bright blue. She then glanced at a spot in the middle of the room and the air began to shimmer.After a few seconds of this shimmering the air split and a portal opened to what appeared to be a dungeon of some kind. \"Time to start my inspection of the runes down here. I do hope Hasdrubal remembered to keep his pets locked up, he would be unhappy if I were forced to harm any of them...\" She muttered as she walked through the portal. Several hours later, the door in the back of the bar opened and Grandma walked out and headed back to her rocking chair, continuing her work where she had left off.

He had once worked on building construction in The White City and around Aaedan, before getting involved in a nasty scandal with the daughter of some duke.

Deciding the time is right to make her move, she saunters up behind Mr. Ruben, and taps him on the right shoulder with his tail. He turns his head to the right, while Naoki leans over to his left. He spins back around, and is surprised to see her there. He stutters, \"M-m-Madame Naoki!\".As he looks into her eyes, he finds himself over his inital surprised, and actually feeling quite calm, even a bit aroused. \"Wh- What can I do for you?\"She twitches her ear in a playful way, and purrs a bit as she speaks, \"I have some business with you, Mr. Rrruben.

There is a certain market for tainted souls, but, I assure you, it is most illegal. That is why, as a Spirifer myself, I only deal with willing subjects and those with whom I can find a particular level of quality.\"Nods and murmurs follow these remarks. One of the women at the table is among the soulless herself. She sips at a mug, doubtlessly unfeeling of the burning hot coffee within.

I am so hungry.\"The Senior Tempter draws out a large pocket watch and flips it open and studies the face intently.

A medium toned voice has neither enough qualities of male or female to perfectly nail down any other qualities than this individual's high-browed manner of speaking.\"Mr. Screwtape. The soulless have no place in the Trade of Souls. I do believe that one, such as yourself, would call them a negative externality. They are no longer part of your models and the Spirifer business has one less body to suck dry.\"The soulless woman looks, dulled eyed, at Screwtape. She can't betray any emotion other than pure apathy, but one could fancy a spark of anger in the grey eyes if they felt so inclined. Others could envision pity. All Screwtape saw was an opportunity. \"I'm afraid there you are incorrect, my good friend,\" Screwtape chuckles, \"Most Soul Traders do not run the operations necessary to sell souls back to an empty vessel. It is so dashed difficult to get a soul to stick in a mortal frame sometimes. Think of those false legs you see soldiers sporting on occasion. The wood and the flesh don't always cooperate, leading to the body rejecting its new attachment. The process can be quite painful to the host, even deadly in some cases. It is the same way with souls.\"Screwtape catches up his walking stick in one hand and taps it lightly against his chest, grimly casting his eyes downward as he does so. \"The rejection of a soul by the body, and the body by the soul, creates a most terrible creature. You have a monster corrupted both in spirit and physical form.\" He leaps up from his chair and smiles most charitably at his captivated audience. \"Which is why the Trade of Souls has regulation in every reputable city in our good land. You cannot have just anyone shoving souls into bodies. That would be absurd! I, however, am fully licensed and qualified in this business. Please, remain here for just a moment.\"The minutes tick by.

Then she hurriedly engages the locks, one, two, three, four, five of them, tapping each one, double checking as she goes.The door to Madame Naoki's office, and by extension, her quarters, is probably one of the more secure doors outside of the Citadel. With a wide grain and rich ebony finish, all the woodwork in the room seemed to come from the same tree. This uniformity gave a refined and dignified air to the room. Madame Naoki fits right in with these surroundings. Judging by the number of locks on the door, one could infer a strong desire for security and privacy. With the door bolted many times over, Madame Naoki exhales a visible breath of relief. She strides over to a cabinet, deftly swings open both doors, and begins to rummage around inside.\"Please, please, have a seat anywhere. I've heard the expression. I'd like to know what's going on down there, but that thump...\"She trails off, engrossed in her search.\"Ah, here we go.\"From the cabinet, she draws out a wooden cylinder. It is perhaps a foot long, with a radius of four inches, about the size of a rolling pin. But unlike a rolling pin, this one had small rounded bumps on it, and was covered in a soft cotton fabric.\"I know my place. I am not a fighter. You could take a rusty spoon out of your apron there and scoop my eyes out, if you really had a mind to. I wouldn't be able to stop you. That's why I've positioned myself here.\"Madame Naoki shuts the cabinet, and takes her peculiar instrument over to the wall. With one hand, she places it against her back and the wall behind her. Luxuriously, catlike, she massages her back. \"It's dangerous at the top. From here, I can see everything, and everyone can see me. I have loads of followers too. Artemis would die before she allows whatever terrible abomination is downstairs to knock at my door. Nearly all of the staff are contractually obligated to assist me however they can.\"After a few dozen rolls of massage, Madame Naoki, satisfied, finishes and sets the roller on the desk. In the process, she shifts an ink well, two bottles, and several large stacks of parchment. Although her desk seems overburdened, she easily moves things about.\"Situations like this really get to me, though. I leave... I was out, until recently, at the Citadel, making introductions. I leave, I was out for perhaps five hours at the most. And when I return, this. Mr. Cresno, my feed of information, sitting there comatose. A hole in the roof, literal demons fighting in the street, and I suspect whatever is downstairs is one of Hasdrubal's beasts. It just gets to me to see my systems and the general order shattered like this...\"Naoki trails off again, staring malcontent at her hands. She looks up and stares at Kate.\"I shouldn't ramble like that. I'm going to get changed, alright?

I am dearly afraid this night is not yet over.\" The man struggles out of his cloak, jacket, and vest, leaving himself robed in shirtsleeves and trousers. Slowly he treads the hallways. Every time he passes a group of employees, Screwtape hustles them backwards along the way he just walked. They didn't need to be this close.

Sorting through the clothing, she momentarily considers a number of garments in turn. As she searches, her tail waves back and forth slightly. Over her shoulder, one could glimpse a great variety of outfits. A plaid pleated skirt, a cashmere sweater. A mess of strings, even some floral print leg warmers. \u201cOh,\u201d her tail stops moving, and her eyebrows rise and fall silently. Pulling her selection out of the drawer, she holds it up in presentation. The garment, -to call it a dress would be an overstatement-, was a thesis on positive and negative space. A full length garment, head to knees, it was cut of a silky maroon fabric. When worn, it would swirl around the body of the wearer like a great snake, covering some areas under its smooth spiral, but leaving other parts as bare as the space between the coils. Holding it up beside Kate, Naoki could see that it wasn\u2019t proportioned properly to fit Kate in the intended way. In fact, if she wore it, one of the blank spaces would be right\u2026 Oooh.She flashes a lecherous grin, and watches for Kate\u2019s reaction. \u201cAh, not quite. I\u2019d like to see you in it, but these things have to be custom fit.\u201dNaoki\u2019s chest heaves as she tries, unsuccessfully, to repress a laugh. She consigns the garment back to the drawer from which it came. After a moment more, she selects another garment, an actual dress this time. Holding it up, she compares it with Kate\u2019s form. It is a traditional, green ballroom style dress, sleeveless, connecting up over the left shoulder. It hugs the upper body smoothly, transitioning with a repeating V pattern into the lower part, where triple layers of diaphanous fabric flow down, hanging around the legs loosely. Along the upper body, sequins and small gems are used to create diagonal floral patterns. \u201cLook at this! This is almost too fitting, and it looks like it might fit your body, too.

If one were to reach into a person and extract this mind, they would be holding an astonishing thing of beauty. One possibly marred by the now-twitching vegetable of the former owner in front of them.Reese's mind didn't match this normal structure. As a being composed almost entirely by and out of mental power, he felt it his obligation to jazz it up. From his own internal perspective, his mind resembled a vast library. Most of the books within held memories, both his and those whose minds he had touched. Indeed, there was a book in the corner with a pen floating above it, scribbling away to capture the latest moments.The most crucial part of the library was the exact center, where a set of couches and armchairs circled a cylindrical bookshelf. The books on this shelf weren't mere memories. These books detailed how Reese's artificial mind worked in excruciating detail. Every facet of his personality, every simulated emotion, every natural reaction or habit had to be placed down in here. Of course, they weren't actually books, just as the library wasn't a library. It simply made it easier for Reese to alter the inner workings of his mind.From the moment Reese had returned from leaving the angel in Hasdrubal's lair, he had set to work on some drastic changes. The ease at which the angel had entered and began hostilities meant that Reese's defenses just weren't sufficient. Improvements must be made. A day had been spent at the speed of thought, amending the contents of the books in the center. The final book was tucked back into place, and the mental projection of a still-very-much-fleshy Reese sprawled back on a couch for a moment of rest.I suppose I don't have the time to rest. There are others out there waiting on me, and I need to get work on the physical modifications.Reese sighed and stared at the ceiling. Duty was a terribly pernicious beast at times. The projection slowly faded as his mind returned to his corporeal form. A skull had no eyelids to open, but the analogy applies. As vision was restored, Reese glanced around the room. His poor doorframe remained empty, slivers of wood poking out of the sides. Other than that, the room seemed in order. \"Buddy, can you show me what happened while I was out?\"There was a whirring and clicking noise behind the curtain, immediately followed by a small marble of crystal that rolled toward Reese's chair. He stopped down and snatched it up, absorbing the memories stored in the swirling depths. A matter of moments, and Reese was up to date on the happenings with the walls of the establishment.Hasdrubal died, then. I made a choice to lead the angel to him under the impression that he could handle the problem, and it was the wrong one.He steepled his fingers and held them before the face of his skull, brooding.The issue was me. I didn't want to fight, because I wanted to avoid causing harm. If I had been capable of stopping him, the problem would have been solved. This must be corrected.Some time later, Reese noticed the Madame and (presumably) Kate heading towards his room. He brushed his thoughts and plans for the future, straightening his jacket and adjusting his sleeves. There was no need to look like a disheveled ruffian.He was terribly amused by the way the Madame crept into his office, but no one in the building had a better poker face. Nor a whiter one.\"Come on in. I hear that you stopped by when I was out.

Beyond that I find cleaning, washing, scrubbing and arranging to be highly calming exercises so we can go from there.\" From within the desk, Naoki pulls out a small number of partially completed documents and contracts. She spreads them across the desk, and takes the quill to one of them, filling in blank spaces and completing the document. \u201cThat works out perfectly. As you\u2019re well aware, the recent renovations included the kitchen, but we\u2019re a bit short of staff who are able to cook. You\u2019ve come at just the right time.\u201dFinished with the document, she slides it across the desk and turns it so that Maelik might view it. \u201cThis first paper here is your formal\u2026 indoctrination? No, that\u2019s not the right word. Perhaps\u2026 acceptance? It\u2019s a formal document stating that the signee has officially joined the Family, and agrees to uphold our rules and ideals. Those rules include such things as helping other family members in need, not acting against the family, and general sorts of things like that. It\u2019s to prevent infighting, mostly.\u201dLeaving Maelik to read and sign the document, she begins work on the next one. \u201cI\u2019m going to go ahead and appoint you as \u2018Head Chef\u2019. No existing member of staff is qualified for such a position. The crew working the kitchen now are only filling in until we can hire properly qualified individuals, such as yourself. This document here is the one about employment. It says that I, Madame Naoki, employ you, as an employee at the Midnight Sun, and will pay you this sum biweekly, and provide you the benefits listed here, and in addition, you agree to work in a manner that aligns with these basic standards of quality, and understand the above.\u201dMadame Naoki slides this, second document across the desk to Maelik. Should they be inspected, both documents would be found to be fair and equitable to both parties. The salary is fair, the listed benefits are reasonable, and there isn\u2019t any fine print. \u201cI think you\u2019ll find nothing disagreeable in those. The first one, about Family acceptance is a new one, actually the first of its kind.. Along with the renovations, I\u2019ve redone a lot of the Family\u2019s inner workings. Sometime in the next few weeks, I\u2019m going to bring everyone up here at some point to sign a copy.\u201dNaoki rubs her chin as she considers what else has to be done. \u201cOh, if you\u2019d rather not join the Family proper, that\u2019s also fine. It\u2019s an opt-in sort of thing. However, if you do decide to, you\u2019ll also be given one of these \u2018Cat\u2019s Paws\u2019.\u201dShe points to her amethyst stud earring with one finger. \u201cIt sounds pretty awkward when I say it, doesn't it... Anyway, all Family members wear one of these purple gems somewhere on their body to show their affiliation. In addition to acting as a badge, the gems are enchanted with communication enchantments and are scying foci. Just across the hall is the office of Mr. Resee Cresno. He\u2019s our sort of eye in the sky, if you will. He has the ability to magically see the area around any of these gems, and initiate voice communication with the wearer. It\u2019s very handy, when he\u2019s not doing his potato impression.\u201dA touch of her earlier frustration creeps into her words as she recalls how very useful Mr. Cresno was during the last crisis.", "link_list": ["/post/13498/thread", "/user/60"], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/POiay80.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@demonlordmaelik\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/13498/thread\" timestamp=\"1444713776\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-60\" title=\"Maelik The Fellblade\"><img alt=\"Maelik The Fellblade Avatar\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/POiay80.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/13498/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1444713776000\" title=\"Oct 12, 2015 21:22:56 GMT -8\">Oct 12, 2015 21:22:56 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-60 group-0\" href=\"/user/60\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@demonlordmaelik\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Maelik The Fellblade</span></a></span> said:</div>Maelik giggled a bit as Naoki laughed, he rather liked bringing a smile to someone's face without physically tearing the gash into their faces himself.

He had known full well the untempered rage he with which he would have to deal if he kept Zuu within the Midnight Sun against her will. He knew all this. Yet he could fix it. Short, heavy chains ran from Zuu's ankles down to the foot of the bed. The bed itself, a massive, wooden affair with four tall posts and rungs for curtains, was carefully bolted on to the floor as well. The curtains were missing, of course, taken to be used in some other area of the Midnight Sun for reconstruction or some such odd purpose. Zuu's wrists had similar chains leading directly to the floor. Heavy metal plates insured that these chains held their captive arms directly alongside the body. After Screwtape had entered, the sound of bolts and locks being secured on the outside of the door rose and fell quickly. With the exception of the windowed wall facing the end of the bed, every open space of wall had large plates bolted in place. Screwtape had instructed his workmen to secure the room into a slapdash room of metal before caring for the patient. The smell of fresh soap and flowers stood in stark contrast to this effective prison cell. The Senior Tempter steps forward towards the window, leaning his back against the wall and crossing his arms.\"Zuu. Please focus on my voice here. I do not deserve your wrath.

I, along with my fellows, took it upon ourselves to help you.\" He chuckles. \"These restraints were put in place not to bind you, but to insure our safety.

Her anger boils up to the surface almost immediately, and she lets out a feral and inhuman roar, throwing herself away from the bed with all her might, causing the metal of the floor to creak and groan in protest, and the chains to snap taut. She's too weak to break the bindings, and so after a few tries, she simply falls flat back onto the bed, cursing her ineptitude. She should be able to break from these weak mundane bonds...are they mundane? She can't even tell. Her energy was all expended on keeping her body alive while the other daemon did his work. Then, the door creaks open and closes just as quickly, and she hears the sound of clicking locks, her glowing orange eyes flashing as she stares through the darkness. It's a New Moon, and the room is pitch black, but her vampiric roots allow her to see through the veil of night and stare directly at Screwtape.

You will DIE for your hubris!\" she yells, her voice not of one being but of two speaking in tandem; her regular, high-pitched and girlish voice harshly contrasted by a deeper, daemonic voice that would strike terror into the heart of a mortal man. Despite her weakness, she's still quite strong in comparison to a mundane being, and she uses all her strength to try and knock Screwtape to the ground so she can steal his lifeforce for herself. There is something...different -- perhaps too kind a word -- about this human, but it doesn't give her any pause. She's dealt with more powerful beings before, she'll do it again now.

The body (sans the faceplate) is loaded into the coffin, and invitations to attend the funeral are sent out to a small group of the Family\u2019s highest members and others who were close to Hasdrubal. On the day of, Madame Naoki is in her room, dressing for the event. Her mood is somber; to match her chosen outfit. A black silken dress, with the same black gloves she wore on the day of the crisis, along with a veil. Her thoughts rotate continuously through the events of the past few weeks, stirring up mixed feelings. The bittersweet day of the crisis, speaking with Resee. The improvements made to the Midnight Sun in the wake of the crisis, and the new employees. She pulls the right hand glove on, wiggling her fingers. Her gloved hand forms a fist as she silently curses the powers that be. She was unprepared for the last week; the emotional rollercoaster that was that fateful day, and the events that followed it.Naoki\u2019s hand relaxes, and she sighs. Why must life go to such extremes? The high points, beyond anything she could have imagined. The low points, not as extreme, but still far too much for her delicate spirit. And today, she would be expected to speak at the funeral; a task she was dreading more than any other. She attempts to rehearse what she might say in her head, but doesn\u2019t get far. Even in her mind\u2019s eye, Naoki finds herself at a loss for words. She pulls the dark veil over her face, and hardens her features. She would at least be composed. Finished dressing, she exits her room into her office. Trusting Artemis to follow, she doesn\u2019t pause, continuing out the heavy office door and downstairs to the ground floor. The usual cherry din of the bar is today dampened. Word had gotten around, and all were aware of today\u2019s significance. Madame Naoki gestures to a waiting bouncer. It was time. The bouncer nods, and disappears into the door marked \u2018Employees Only\u2019. Within a few moments, the door opens again, and the bouncer emerges, carrying the front of Hasdrubal\u2019s coffin. The rest of the coffin and another bouncer follow close behind. What had before been a dampened din now became another one of those terrible silences. All eyes were trained on the coffin held between the two bouncers. A few patrons rose from their seats in respect, and held their hats to their chest. Within moments, nearly all other patrons had followed suit. A few of the more inebriated customers had attempted to join in, their failed attempts to stand the only thing to break the somber silence. It was clear to all; Hasdrubal would be serving no more drinks. A few more moments pass in silence, before Madame Naoki signals the end of it. With a nod, she motions to Paul and the other bouncer. They nod in acknowledgement, and begin making their way to the door, coffin held between them.Madame Naoki and the others who would be attending the funeral fall into line behind them, the start of the funeral procession. As the group exits the bar, the drunken populace breaks into  song, an off-key, parodic rendition of a solemn religious chorus, lamenting Hasdrubal\u2019s passing. The lyrics are mismatched and poorly executed, but the intent is still clear; all would mourn the death of their favorite barkeep.The coffin is loaded into a carriage, and the procession sets off down the street, headed for the graveyard. <Exit to A Graveyard>", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Over the course of a few days, quiet preparations are made for Hasdrubal\u2019s funeral.

That's when she hears the jangling of the chains and the weight upon her wrists. Her vision clears and she looks around herself, her eyes narrowing. This was not somewhere friendly, clearly. Her anger boils up to the surface almost immediately, and she lets out a feral and inhuman roar, throwing herself away from the bed with all her might, causing the metal of the floor to creak and groan in protest, and the chains to snap taut. She's too weak to break the bindings, and so after a few tries, she simply falls flat back onto the bed, cursing her ineptitude. She should be able to break from these weak mundane bonds...are they mundane? She can't even tell. Her energy was all expended on keeping her body alive while the other daemon did his work. Then, the door creaks open and closes just as quickly, and she hears the sound of clicking locks, her glowing orange eyes flashing as she stares through the darkness. It's a New Moon, and the room is pitch black, but her vampiric roots allow her to see through the veil of night and stare directly at Screwtape. His words brush through her enraged mind like a gentle breeze through a field of grass, but before long it rights itself, and she springs from the bed at breakneck speed, aiming to tackle Screwtape to the floor with an animalistic growl.\"You thought you could contain me? You will DIE for your hubris!\" she yells, her voice not of one being but of two speaking in tandem; her regular, high-pitched and girlish voice harshly contrasted by a deeper, daemonic voice that would strike terror into the heart of a mortal man. Despite her weakness, she's still quite strong in comparison to a mundane being, and she uses all her strength to try and knock Screwtape to the ground so she can steal his lifeforce for herself. There is something...different -- perhaps too kind a word -- about this human, but it doesn't give her any pause. She's dealt with more powerful beings before, she'll do it again now. She is strong now, and no one can stop her. Or so she thinks...\"Pride is only a fault if one is wrong, dear heart.\" Screwtape manages to quip as the daemon form hurtles through the air towards him. Such an opponent would not merit any more zingers, he realizes with disappointment. Best to get the fighting over and done with. Screwtape anticipates the impact, but is slightly behind in actually planting his feet beneath himself. Zuu hits him like a runaway carriage lead by a team of overzealous steeds. Something in the back of Screwtape's mind awakens. Dark and abhorrent memories of a place beyond this, the intangible thoughts of a war far greater and terrible. That was a fight destined to be lost. Today there was only one angel, a fallen one at that, and Screwtape was free to dictate his own role. This day was winnable. That day was not.The Tempter slams into the wall with a grunt of alarm. His right leg deftly strikes the back of Zuu's unprotected knees with a keen application of force, staggering her slightly. Screwtape follows up by ducking out of her reach to the right, but not before earning a rake of claws across his chest for the effort. He lowers his shoulder and lunges towards the patient. If Screwtape could knock them both out of the window, he could draw the fight away from the Midnight Sun.

That\u2019s a sizable sum.. Her left eyebrow elevates slightly. Twenty percent stake? That\u2019s outright outrageous. Her right eyebrow matches the left, and the two climb further together.As he details the changes he would like to see made to the atmosphere, the two eyebrows climb even further together, reaching new heights with each proposed alteration. By the time he has finished, Madame Naoki\u2019s eyebrows are practically floating above her head.Once he is finished, Naoki\u2019s face returns to its default, flat expression as she considers silently how to handle the situation. Accepting the terms he just proposed, changes and all, is out of the question. Not only is a twenty percent cut far, far too high, his proposed alterations would obliterate business as The Midnight Sun knew it.That left two options. Either negotiating for a more favorable deal, or, alternatively, tossing him out her office right then and there.Madame Naoki seriously considers both options. The man didn\u2019t seem like a skilled negotiator, nor a self-made businessman. She surmised that his fortune was made on some lucky break, such as getting another business to agree to terms as favorable for him as the ones he just proposed, or perhaps he had inherited his wealth. With her very particular set of skills, she was confident that she could convince Mr. Swartz into a deal that would at least be fair. However. She was already in a bad mood. Who is this bird-brain to come in here and propose he get 20% of her attention, much less 20% of The Midnight Sun\u2019s profits. \"A fool and his money are soon parted\":A proverb proven millions of times over, by the very existence of The Midnight Sun. Madame Naoki decides that she will continue negotiations, but only if Calico responds favorably to some of her stimulation. As if on cue, the lights in the room dim, almost imperceptibly. The atmosphere shifts, from a clean, professional air of business, to something ever so slightly more\u2026 mature. Madame Naoki\u2019s expression and body language change as well, the smallest of smirks, the slight tilt of the head. None of these changes should be major enough to garner conscious notice, intended merely to appeal to Calico\u2019s... subconscious; to grease the wheels of negotiation in Naoki\u2019s favor.\u201cHmm.\u201d she mocks contemplation. \u201cYes, let\u2019s\u2026 negotiate.\u201dIf one observing the conversation derived meaning based solely on enunciation, they might think that Naoki had just proposed something very indecent.\u201cTo start off with, I\u2019m not convinced on your proposed changes\u2026 This place is already very successful as it is, and I\u2019m not sure that trying to appeal to the upper class would result in increased profits.\u201d", "link_list": ["/post/13643/thread", "/user/717"], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/iBQsIHB.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@calicoswartz\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/13643/thread\" timestamp=\"1444891161\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-717\" title=\"Calico Swartz\"><img alt=\"Calico Swartz Avatar\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/iBQsIHB.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/13643/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1444891161000\" title=\"Oct 14, 2015 22:39:21 GMT -8\">Oct 14, 2015 22:39:21 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-717 group-0\" href=\"/user/717\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@calicoswartz\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Calico Swartz</span></a></span> said:</div>\"Well, I'd like to invest approximately  40,000 gold for a 20% stake in the business's profits.

After waiting for Artemis, if Artemis were to follow her, she shuts the door, and throws all the locks. As she is sliding the bolts into place, she winces. Naoki\u2019s hand was still very sore from the punch she threw earlier. Her right hand too, she wouldn\u2019t be able to write. As the implications of this sink in, she sighs, and curses Hasdrubal for the upteenth time. This would be a lingering anger, she could tell. There wasn\u2019t anything that got her quite as mad as when one of her companions deliberately worked against her. She could cope with loss, accept failure, or live with a sub-optimal decision. Those sorts of things couldn\u2019t be helped. As so long as they gave it their best, there wasn\u2019t much more that could be done. But betrayal. Betrayal truly aggravated Madame Naoki. Not only the act itself, but what it implied. Betrayal stated outright that the companion wasn\u2019t entirely loyal to Naoki, and implied that she wasn\u2019t worthy of that person\u2019s loyalty. Hasdrubal had been there since the inception of the modern Midnight Sun; a significant number of years by this point. He had kept mostly to himself, and she hadn\u2019t had very many personal discussions with him, not nearly as many as she has had with the likes of Cresno, or Screwtape. Perhaps that was why he didn\u2019t respect her, she mused. Perhaps he just didn\u2019t know her well enough to truly respect her.That was a problem that she would have to fix. As soon as she stopped wanting to forcefully stuff him into that coffin, that is. Having finished locking the door, she turns, and notices a box on her desk. Approaching it, she peers in the top to see the contents. Clothing. Specifically, Kate\u2019s clothing, that she had left behind on that eventful night. It was now cleaned and folded neatly, along with some of her own laundry, and left in this laundry box on her desk, as was routine. It usually didn\u2019t take quite so long for the laundry to cycle, however. The staff have been pretty busy over the past week, and it was correct to prioritize repairs over such things as laundry, she thought.However, the sight of the apron has a profound effect on Madame Naoki\u2019s mood. A\u2026 pleasant effect, she decided. The clothes would need to be returned as soon as possible. She could easily send Artemis or some other ununiformed member of staff to deliver them right now. Or, alternatively\u2026 Madame Naoki\u2019s lips break into a silent smirk, her plan formulated. Leaving the box on her desk, she retreats to her room, where she would sleep easily, visions of tomorrow dancing in her dreams.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<Enter from A Graveyard>"}, "post-13787": {"user": "Empress Naoki", "user_num": 607, "timestamp": "1445081422000", "message": "The following post is completely out of character.For those of you attempting to keep track at home, here is a coherent timeline of Madame Naoki\u2019s recent actions.First, the eventful evening of the attack. The next morning, repairs had begun. Then a timeskip equating to about a week was initiated, during which the repairs were finished and Naoki made changes to the administrative structure of the business. After this timeskip, Madame Naoki had three guests in her office. In order, beginning sometime in the morning, she met with Demonlord Maelik on the topic of employment, Skarlet on the topic of her continued residence and eventual employment, and Calico Swartz on the topic of his investing in The Midnight Sun. After negotiations had concluded with Calico and he had left, Naoki went to sleep, and on the next morning, she attended Hasdrubal\u2019s funeral. She has since returned from the funeral, and plans to visit Green\u2019s Greens tomorrow morning.I apologize to all participants and readers about the condition of this topic, and how terribly out of order these posts are.

She fell into a loping stride, quickly covering ground. An effort was made to conceal the efficiency that marked a warrior, something that could draw suspicion from areas she wouldn't like.

Anyone who spared her a second glance would have been convinced that she was a businesswoman, one late for a meeting of some kind.Upon encountering Skarlet the first time, she merely brushed past with a soft apology. The woman rounded a corner and took a different route, her speedy movement enabling to cover more ground. The next time Skarlet would pass her by, she was in the guise of a haggard beggar, down on her luck. Assuming the vampire found nothing amiss, she would begin to follow her from a distance: the other side of the street, a couple of blocks behind, perhaps maneuvering herself in front and walking past yet again with minor cosmetic changes. Dashes through alleyways and over rooftops upon which she would be unseen from below enabled her repositioning. If and only if Skarlet had remained oblivious this whole time, which was probably rather unlikely, a tiny quarrel would thunk into the doorframe as the girl turned her back to walk through.

His voice regains it's usual cheer as he continues.\"The short version is that I recently ended a long term employment contract. It was my first job and though I imagine the skills I learned are still in demand I am not sure if I wish to continue in that line of work. Unfortunately I find myself I'll equipped to find or perform other jobs so... I guess we will see how things turn out.\"Alden sits in silence for a long moment before a flash of realization crosses his face.\"OH! Where are my manners I mean all I know about you is your name! I should ask some questions in turn right? Where are you from? What brings you to the Free City?

He wore a simple garb, a light grey jerkin and black breeches which ended halfway down his shins. Over all of this he wore a black cloak which completely enveloped his form.

He was completely spotless from head to toe, with not a speck of dirt tainting the black cloak, so clean in fact it seemed almost unnatural. His movements were fluid, calculated, as he sauntered in, sliding the hood off his head as he entered, revealing his black hair and youthful face, which was also untouched by dirt or any other imperfection.

Dark brown eyes that almost black would slide across the room taking in every face, every detail hungrily, before moving to take a seat.\u00a0The other patrons did not seem to notice his presence immediately, and instead the din continued on, the sound of loud conversation and clank of glasses ever constant. This solace did not last long however as soon they noticed the boy's apparent age, a particularly rowdy group of patrons, perhaps already thoroughly intoxicated began to to shout crude jokes to the boy who sat alone at a table near them, as well as just seeking to disturb him. \"Who leh dis green boy 'n here?\" he slurred, \"You, boy. Was wrong with ye? No other place to go, I bet yer have some sob story ta tell us now to get are money, same as every other street rat.\" By now the loud ranting of the drunken man had attracted more attention from nearby patrons who watched with mild interest as the man staggered over, obviously up to no good.Still the black hair boy stared at the man, his dark eyes made him look almost bored with the situation. As the man stood over him, the boy could smell the alcohol in his breath as well as the sour scent of sweat. It seemed the man sweat out as much as he took in, giving him a rather rancid smell. \"Well? Get ya ratty ass out o' here, no one will give ye coin here and we don't need no rats scurrying about.\" he stood over the boy, perhaps to intimidate him into moving, but he sat still, staring up at the man, whom was almost twice his size. Almost indiscernible at first but soon growing more apparent, a smile formed on the boy's lips bearing pure white teeth, almost as if he was amused by the man. This only seemed to infuriate him.\"Ya think this is funny? Well I'll show y-\" the man had begun to say as he reached to wrench him up out of his seat by his jerkin before he was cut off. His hand brushed lightly on the front of the boy's shirt before a blank, horrified look washed over his face before he collapsed in a heap at the boy's feet un-moving. The boy looked down at the now motionless body, the previous smile now having disappeared, he seemed to take a rather disinterested demeanor again as he turned around in his chair, forgetting about the man collapsed on the floor as a couple of patrons whom had been with him tried slapping him awake to no avail before carrying him away. A few of them glanced nervously at the boy as they did so but did not bother him again. Any who followed the patrons to find out about the condition of the man would find that he was dead, the life snuffed out of him as easily as a drunk might pass out.\u00a0What queer creatures these are, he thought to himself mildly as he waited for a waitress to serve him.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "A boy with straight black hair, who seemed no older than twelve walked into The Midnight Sun.

His current state of employment was something he had no real reticence talking about. Alden's issue was that Sail probably wasn't curious about his current state of employment. Alden was fairly certain that Sail was curious about what he had been before. What Alden still on some level was.Alden weighs his options on one hand he still did not feel entirely comfortable discussing his past especially in a public venue. Alden could interpret the question literally delivering an adequate though unsatisfying answer before trying to redirect the conversation. On the other hand Sail had paid for his meal and Alden felt that his new friend deserved at least some kind of straight answer. Alden's mind resolved on the choice of being honest but vague. With that settled Alden begins to speak slowly and deliberately choosing each word carefully.\"Well currently I am unemployed which explains the begging. I assume you would be more interested in my previous work which I am uncomfortable speaking about especially in a public place.\"Alden gestures at the other patrons surrounding them before continuing.\"I will give you an answer though you will have to forgive me as it will be a bit vague.\"Alden takes a breath organizes his thoughts then continues in the same slow tone.\"I was in a long term contract with an organization of professional... lets call them problem solvers. If a person had the right connections, and enough gold they could hire us to solve their problems. Our group had 6 main members and one rotating support member. We all excelled in different fields, and we worked as a well oiled team. My position in the group could best be described as... a conflict resolution specialist.\"Alden chuckles humorously at this description and continues to speak.\"If a client had a conflict it was my job to resolve it for them, permanently. Unfortunately for the rest of the team I eventually got out of my long term contract. Free of metaphorical and literal binds I decided I had a personal conflict with all of them which I proceeded to resolve.\"As Alden remembers how he resolved his differences with The Set his grin changes from jovial to cruel.

Alden his usual friendly grin back in place thinks on the other thing Sail had talked about. \"Really there's no professionals in soul collecting?

One cook in particular (the same one who had to gall to hesitate before cutting some carrots) was more nervous than the others as he realized that he was already on the expert chef's list and wanted no part in finding out what happened to anyone who disappointed him.He could feel something was off about his boss, something that screamed sinister and volatile, a dangerous aura that threatened to suffocate him whenever Maelik happened to pass too closely. The cook was desperate to never give reason to allow Maelik a moment alone with him for fear that something horrible would befall him and his paranoia brought him to new levels of attentiveness.The demon on the other hand had no such plans to punish any of the staff in the traditional sense, they were employees of the bar after all and not his own personal underlings. At most he'd give them a harsh lesson or two in how to do the job right, and possibly invade their mind to psychologically torture/repurpose them until they shaped up.In fact he was about to give a good and proper tongue lashing on how to always cut the vegetables with the thinnest knife available in order to reduce waste when he heard a commotion going on out in the main floor.With a groan and a hiss Maelik carefully placed his ridiculous chef's hat at the door and ordered the others to continue on like nothing was happening while he saw to the issue.\"The Madame is not going to be pleased with this...\" he sighed before calmly walking through the door and quickly surveying the situation and its seriousness.\"Okay so one skewered kid, one appreciative customer going full throttle towards the apparent offenders and one group of uncouth ruffians looking for thrashing. Alright then time to get to work.\"As the Demonlord walked past Kevin he was sure to give him a friendly wave and a smile that said 'what can one do?' before turning his attention to the crowd. With a deep rumbling voice that brooked no argument he ordered for the crowd to clear some space and not to get themselves into a tizzy and start a rabble rousing bar fight.If the crowd new what was good for them then they would have at least given him a clear line to the heart of the problem because to get in his way was tantamount to standing in front of rockslide, with his determined stride not slowing in the least.It would take him a moment to get to the troublemakers themselves but woe be to the them when he eventually makes it there for you see, his sleeves were rolled up and his apron was removed.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Maelik and his crew were toiling away in the kitchen as was the norm for them, every living soul taking unprecedented care with their duties with the demon's watchful eye scrutinizing their every move.

The body seemed to go unnoticed for now, with the more immediate danger at hand that needed to be dealt with, the boy seemed far beyond help. So predictable these humans are. Revenge is a powerful motivator for them. Perhaps unbeknownst to those in the bar, who seemed more worried with the attacking ruffians, a dark sinister aura had begun creeping throughout the area, permeating everything within the room. I have absolute control now.The lifeless eyes of the boy seemed to come back to life, his eyes breaking their lifeless stare as a luminescent white light seemed to replace them. A moment later the fighting and commotion would seem to have come to a grinding halt as a powerful, primordial magic took hold of the room. Those caught within would find themselves frozen within their own bodies, unable to move as the magic bound them in place. The only thing most would be able to move would be their eyes. The room was now dead quiet as the the boy rose, but was he simply a boy? The bright white lights that seemed to replaced his eyes left a trailing white aura in wake in the air as he moved. Moving his hand to his neck he pulled the bolt out of neck but in the wound there was no blood or flesh but instead an empty blackness, the wound soon closed up again. He clutched the bolt in his hand for a minute, looking it over with a morbid curiosity, a few moments later the bolt disintegrated into a few wisps of darkness as well before disappearing into the air. Standard crossbow bolt, shaft of wood. Iron quarrel head. Crafted about... two years prior in this region.\u00a0Slowly he sauntered over to where the men who attacked him stood frozen, only their eyes could follow him as he made his way over. He stood in front of the man who seemed to be the leader of the trio, staring straight at him with those alien blazing white eyes, \"Imminent death seems to cause them... distress.\" The man stood there un-moving as the he placed a hand on his chest, and just like the crossbow bolt previously, the man disintegrated into black wisps of darkness, before disappearing all together. He did the same with the other two men, all three standing there un-moving, but their eyes told a clear story of unparalleled anguish as they fell apart. \"Hm... there is much to learn about this world.\"\u00a0Another spell would be cast at that moment, the same dark magic this time would wipe the memory of those minds more feeble in the face of magic, and they would completely forget of this incident. The boy would then disappear, as soon as he appeared, sauntering out of the Midnight Sun the same way as he had walked in, it would be a few long moments before the patrons within would be let go of the magic hold. The amnesia spell had momentarily knocked those within unconscious, so most would wake up thoroughly confused, for perhaps a few moments before they would go on about their day once more.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The man with the crossbow would be hit square in the face with the glass Alden threw, the glass smashing apart on his face and cutting him up real good.

One of the targets speaks to the assassin some pathetic attempt to intimidate the target is ignored. What the assassin does not ignore is the magic he can see permeating the bar. Turning to face the targets the assassin searches for the source of the dark magic and he sees the dead boy stand. This is enough to temporarily jar the assassin's concentration and he does not have time to react as the dead boys magic seizes hold of him and the rest bar patrons. Of course there wasn't much the assassin could have done to a avoid the paralytic spell. The assassins armor had carried runes to ward off magical attacks but he didn't have his armor anymore. The assassin watches and waits his fury slowly rising. Of course the assassin is too controlled to allow the fury to show on his face. The assassin face is an emotionless mask the only hint of what he feels is in his eyes. Normally Alden's eyes sparkle with a barely contained mirth, a genuine joy at the world around him. The assassins eyes contain no joy they simply smolder with his controlled rage, violence waiting to be directed on a target.He watches the dead boy as it disintegrates the three thugs one after the other. What the hell was this thing? How many powerful magical beings lived in this blasted city? These are the thoughts that run through the assassins mind as he waits to see what will happen next. The assassin sees tendrils of magic flow from the dead boy he feels them trying to enter his mind. The assassin can tell that the being behind this magic has considerable power perhaps enough to crush his mental defenses with a concentrated attack. This is not a concentrated attack and the assassin has been trained to fight against mental assaults. The assassin focuses on his fury allowing it to fill his mind to consume all other thoughts to fight all attempts to control him. The assassin focus's on a single thing, his title, his emotion, his purpose, his sin, his name. \"Wrath.\"His absolute focus on his Wrath allows the assassin to withstand the dead boys attempts to wipe his memory. Finally the dead boy leaves and the assassin slowly relaxes letting out a deep breath. The assassin observes the other patrons of the bar as they shake of the effects of the mental assault. Slowly bit by bit Alden regains control of himself through deep calming breaths. The last vestiges of Alden's fury fade away and his customary grin returns to his face. Alden spots Sail who seems fine which is good he had no idea how the dead boys magic might have effected the strange creature. Alden also sees the chef who had strolled out of the kitchen to deal with the thugs. Smiling brightly he says to the chef.\"Oh you are the chef right! I didn't have a chance to say it last time, but you make the best sandwich I have ever had! Thank you very much for your work you are truly a master of your craft.\"Alden gives the chef a little bow, deciding to tactfully omit the part where it was the only sandwich he had ever had.

That's when she hears the jangling of the chains and the weight upon her wrists. Her vision clears and she looks around herself, her eyes narrowing. This was not somewhere friendly, clearly. Her anger boils up to the surface almost immediately, and she lets out a feral and inhuman roar, throwing herself away from the bed with all her might, causing the metal of the floor to creak and groan in protest, and the chains to snap taut. She's too weak to break the bindings, and so after a few tries, she simply falls flat back onto the bed, cursing her ineptitude.

Thank you kindly.\"He then departed for the lone stairwell, discovered that first door on the left, and knocked three times. He gave his tunic a tug, as though it could possibly make him look less bedraggled.As Madame Naoki relaxes in her chair, a whisper rings out from her earring. Not loud enough to be heard to anyone else, the voice tells her of Karath\u2019s approach. \u201cMmmm? What? No, I\u2019m not ready for- \u2026. Dammit, Reese.\u201dWith a groan, she sits up, surveying the room. Completely unprepared for visitors. Despite her exhaustion, she launches into a flurry of action. The baskets of purchased goods are ferried into her chambers, to sit in a decidedly crooked line on the floor next to her bed. The half-finished contracts now visible on the desk are stuffed into a desk drawer. Cabinets are closed, books are stacked away onto one of her many shelves. Artemis had been kind enough to remove the blanket from the floor, but Naoki herself was still hardly presentable. From her dresser, Madame Naoki hastily selects a bright red sweater and a pair of what she usually used as loungewear pants, regretting not being able to spend more time to choose an appropriate outfit. One usually wears a sweater over something, after all. If Kate had decided to follow them back to the office, Naoki would gently usher Kate into her chamber, with an explanative apology and a suggestion to freshen up for dinner, gesturing to the cleaning and self care supplies atop the dresser before closing the door.Now with the room and her appearance taken care of, Madame Naoki thinks back to the words Reese used when informing her of the visitor. According to their code, his very particular wording told her a little bit about the impending visitor. Specifically, that they were a singular individual that appeared to be male, didn\u2019t appear to be particularly dangerous, and didn\u2019t explicitly state the nature of their business with her. She silently curses Resse once again, she didn\u2019t have much to go off. After a hurried moment of consideration, she opts to go for the bubbly and likable. Leveraging her considerable skills of self-presentation and body language control, her demeanor -and with it, the atmosphere of the room- shifts; no longer is Madame Naoki exhausted from a day of passion and a long walk back, still far away, consumed in her enamourment, but rather filled with energy, each movement expressing a wealth of youthful exuberance, each lighthearted word springing from her lips like birds taking flight. Cracking her knuckles, she hopes that whoever it is that she\u2019s about to meet will take well to this attitude she\u2019s adopted. After Karath knocks, she waits the appropriate amount of time, as not to seem like she was standing just on the other side of the door, before opening the door inwards. It would be apparent to Karath that Madame Naoki\u2019s office had been spared no expense, fully benefiting from the massive success of the business as a whole. The center of the room is dominated by the wide desk, large even as desks go. On the side facing the door, two visitor chairs sit, lined with comfortable red cloth. The walls are paneled with a similar red velvet fabric, fastened in an eye pleasing geometric pattern. The far wall is completely covered in book cases, and is mostly filled, with tomes of varying size and color. Three doors, two to the right, one to the left, lead into other rooms, the likes of which wouldn\u2019t be immediately obvious to Karath. All of the woodwork in the room, the doors, the desk, the chairs, all of the cabinets, bookshelves, and edging, all seem to originate from the same, dark ebony tree, all polished to a fine finish. This contributes a sense of continuity and cohesion to the room.Madame Naoki nods her head in greeting to Karath, and offers her hand to shake. \u201cHello! I\u2019m Madame Naoki, owner and proprietor of The Midnight Sun. I understand you have business with me?... Please, have a seat.\u201dShe gestures to the guest chairs, and after Karath seats himself, she would take her own seat across from him, listening to whatever he might have to say.", "link_list": ["/post/16146/thread", "/user/786"], "image_list": ["//storage.proboards.com/6046952/avatar/VCvZgCHAvudMDRlrcZo3.png"], "html": "<div author=\"@karath\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/16146/thread\" timestamp=\"1447645483\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-786\" title=\"Karath Durson\"><img alt=\"Karath Durson Avatar\" src=\"//storage.proboards.com/6046952/avatar/VCvZgCHAvudMDRlrcZo3.png\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/16146/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1447645483000\" title=\"Nov 15, 2015 19:44:43 GMT -8\">Nov 15, 2015 19:44:43 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-786 group-0\" href=\"/user/786\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@karath\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Karath Durson</span></a></span> said:</div>\"Excellent.

It glides smoothly across the table towards the broker, clinking softly against the glass of their own container. A diaphanous shimmer rests within the bottle as it spins. The light from a nearby chandelier strikes through the glass, casting a sparkling shimmer onto the tabletop. The devil smiles.\"You said something about souls from humans with red hair earlier, I do believe. It is an all too common misconception, something the Lowerarchy has had a dickens of a time eradicating.

It belonged to a particularly talented member of the theater in a certain city. The poor owner was indebted to the local Acting Guild. I saw her talent. The guild did not.

The second is tied to it, but involves some heavy doses of theological bylaws, Nonlinear Eschatology and such nonsense.

According to their code, his very particular wording told her a little bit about the impending visitor. Specifically, that they were a singular individual that appeared to be male, didn\u2019t appear to be particularly dangerous, and didn\u2019t explicitly state the nature of their business with her. She silently curses Resse once again, she didn\u2019t have much to go off. After a hurried moment of consideration, she opts to go for the bubbly and likable.

Cracking her knuckles, she hopes that whoever it is that she\u2019s about to meet will take well to this attitude she\u2019s adopted. After Karath knocks, she waits the appropriate amount of time, as not to seem like she was standing just on the other side of the door, before opening the door inwards. It would be apparent to Karath that Madame Naoki\u2019s office had been spared no expense, fully benefiting from the massive success of the business as a whole. The center of the room is dominated by the wide desk, large even as desks go. On the side facing the door, two visitor chairs sit, lined with comfortable red cloth. The walls are paneled with a similar red velvet fabric, fastened in an eye pleasing geometric pattern. The far wall is completely covered in book cases, and is mostly filled, with tomes of varying size and color. Three doors, two to the right, one to the left, lead into other rooms, the likes of which wouldn\u2019t be immediately obvious to Karath.

It should only take about ten minutes give or take the time to send it out.\"With that he gave one more cheek pinch apiece and hurried back into the kitchen, promptly ordering the other cooks to give him space and to not get in his way. He got the prep done in a matter of seconds, magically manipulating the pots and pans and the first of the raw ingredients into place as he lit the fires and poured the water. Once completed he took special care to carefully rub the necessary spices into the meats, starting with the thick pork roast and then the ham, leaving the bacon alone because it was... well bacon.Once the meats had the right spices and flavorings gently massaged into them he grabbed a heat rod and lifted it up to his mouth before letting out a steady stream of intense black flames. Once it reached the desired heat he cut an incision at the rear of the roast and slid the rod into it, allowing it to cook the pork from the inside out first so as to not put the spices to waste. With that out of the way he was free to fry up the bacon and glaze the ham, simultaneously putting the sweet potatoes in a small iron box and setting it atop the counter in a vacant spot. Another gout of hellfire would come blazing out only this time its intended target was the box, heating it up to the point it was glowing red. He continued until the unholy element of his flame began to deteriorate the box, even when he held back the intensity of he flames he could not help that facet of his powers. Although since the potatoes within were no subjected to that same unholy soul scorching flame they were not damaged by its demonic touch.Satisfied that they'd be boiled to perfection he focused his efforts of the next phase of the plan, the salted bear for Karath. In terms of complexity it would be far easier to create than the pork but its taste would be on par with it when paired with the rest of the dish.It didn't take him long to finish up when he was on a roll, the remaining vegetables were boiled in the pots, the cake was in the oven, the bacon was fried and the pancakes were being flipped as the eggs were almost done. The other cooks could only look on in awe as Maelik went about in a flurry of blurred movements accentuated by the occasional blast of demon fire. It was amazing that he could accomplish so much in just under ten minutes.And at last, when the figurative dust finally settled the Demonlord looked on at his work with a contented smile, everything was cooked to perfection thanks to a mixture of his own unnatural flame and use of unconventional equipment. Not only that but each dish was arranged to be as aesthetically pleasing as possible, a concern that Maelik always made sure to address when cooking for others.\"Good, now then if you'll excuse me, I must go and deliver the goods. You all just... I dunno do what you do.

Attempting to prevent the dinner from degrading into a knife fight, Madame Naoki tries to placate Skarlet, resting a reassuring hand on her shoulder.\u201cHey, easy there, Skarlet. I think we\u2019d have something to say to any angry mobs. There\u2019s no need to fear disgruntled and lightly armed members of the general public.\u201dHoping that Skarlet has been mollified enough as to not lunge over the table to shank Alden, she removes her hand and addresses Alden, with a more sumptuous tone, for she is to speak of her personal code and policies.\u201cI am an equal opportunity employer. I always choose the best candidate for the job, irrespective of race, history, gender, or any other superficial factor. I\u2019m aware of the negative social stigma that some races carry, and frankly, I don\u2019t care. As so long as my employees perform their jobs to the quality I expect, and no factor of their being interferes with their ability to be the very best, I couldn\u2019t care less as to what sorts of horns, tails, strange fetishes, or other irregularities they may possess.\u201d\u201cWith this policy, I\u2019ve come across an untapped wealth of talent, that was previously shunned or discarded by society. To provide one example, I once, during the infancy of my management of this establishment, met a man named Desmond. Desmond is, to put it simply, a werewolf. An honest to goodness werewolf, who unwillingly transforms every full moon into a feral beast. This effect, understandably, made it rather difficult for poor Desmond to hold down a job for longer than thirty days. However, the circumstance that brought him to The Sun was far more tragic than just that. In the rampage of the previous night, Desmond had unwittingly mauled his fiancee to death. She was aware of his trouble, and knew the risk, but that didn\u2019t help her much. This misdemeanor was known to the village he inhabited, and they intended to hunt him down for the murder. He ran all the way to Isra, some thirty miles, on foot, and stumbled into The Sun wreaked with the worst sort of guilt. He planned to drown himself in drink before taking his own life.\u201dShe pauses here in her story, to catch a breath, and allow her last words to sink in for the appropriate amount of time.\u201cHowever, one of our associates here, Mr. Cresno, had heard of Desmond\u2019s activities, and managed to speak with him before Desmond made any rash decisions. Let it suffice to say, Cresno was able to talk Desmond down, ease some of his guilt, and offer him a job. Today, Demond works with Mr. Cresno, keeping tabs on current events within the city. He has managed to cope with his guilt, and is provided with an alchemical concoction that allows him to retain his full mental facilities during his transformation. As such, he makes for an excellent example in a discussion such as this, as an individual who has found peace and a new beginning within these walls.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my belief that an individual\u2019s decisions are is determined solely by that individual. And by their behavior, any individual is free to break the stereotypes associated with their race, and be their own entity. In this respect, Desmond is an imperfect example, as one of his characteristics was such that he was unable to make his own decisions, and in that period of no control, murdered his fiancee, but my point stands.\u201d\u201cAs such, I think it\u2019s rather impudent  to assume things about an individual based on something such as their race, especially relating to alignment and personality. I recognize that some characteristics are very common among members of some races, but it\u2019s impertinent to assume, when meeting someone for the first time, that they will carry the same tendencies or temperament as others you may have met before. Though I\u2019ve not known Ulciscor or Skarlet for very long, I find them both to be perfectly polite and individuals worthy of my respect. Ulciscor is one of the most well spoken and outgoing individuals I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of speaking with, and Skarlet seems eager to find her new place in this world, not embracing any of the negative aspects of her condition.\u201d\u201cRegardless, I hold everyone under my employ to the word of the local law. Not a single one of my employees, to my knowledge, has committed any major infraction of Israsian mandate during the time that they\u2019ve been under my employ. I think that, before we start labeling people as \u2018sinister\u2019 and \u2018evil\u2019, we should find some basis to warrant those sorts of descriptors.\u201dFinished with her small speech, Madame Naoki folds her hands in her lap, and tilts her head slightly upwards with a small huff, still a bit indignant about Alden\u2019s labeling.

I poured a heart and soul into this and I do so hope that you'll enjoy it.\"With a flamboyant twist he flashily slid the plates to their proper spots. For Skarlet the demon made a plate of fluffy pancakes liberally sprinkled with powdered sugar with a heaping side of crispy bacon and hash browns cooked to a beautiful golden crisp in a pan that substituted any form of oil with butter to increase the richness of the taste. Tagging along were a few slices of pre-segmented french toast(or is it Gauldin toast now?) that had decidedly less powdered sugar on them but was accompanied by a small glass of syrup to allow for dipping. Finally there was the bottle of syrup proper and a pitcher of chocolate milk nearby. The demon almost envied Skarlet, he had an infamous sweet tooth that urged him to make himself something along the lines of this just as soon as he was able.Alden would receive a juicy plump glazed pig roast that was cooked internally from a heat rod and slow cooked over an elderwood fire to give a smoky aftertaste before finally being seared by a quick blast of fire in order to endow it with a pleasing texture.. In addition there were mashed sweet potatoes that were pseudo-steam cooked within an iron box, the dryness of cooking environment doing wonders to assist in the latter stages when mixed with butter, high end cow milk and just a dollop of cream. Bringing up the rear was the coal grilled corn, each kernel carefully removed from the cob so as to minimize any waste and a bottle of Medanese gold wine, the same variety as the kind he intended to serve Naoki for her mini meal.Karath's plate was perhaps Maelik's favorite to, adorned with his ever favored salted bear sitting atop a bed of lettuce so crisp that one could swear even looking at it made it crunch delightfully. Included in this was a side of fried jasmine rice, assorted grilled vegetables mixed in among the grains to make each taste a more explosive experience. Lastly there were three healthy sized cuts of freshly made and lightly toasted pita bread and if one were to give them a sniff they'd discover that at some point in the baking process it had been infused with garlic.Reyna's dish was a tricky thing for the demon though, indeed it was the reason he had taken as long as he did with getting the food out here. He had no idea what it was she would prefer and being a beast of the lower planes he was at a loss on how the purer beings from up on high handled their food. All in all it was a puzzling dilemma for Maelik but just like always he managed to find an acceptable route to take. For the once-angel he prepared a seafood platter, he wasn't certain of it but he felt that celestial beings didn't often consume underwater delicacies, or anything for that matter. A red lobster still steaming from the the pot dominated the plate, flanked by two crab arms and a circle of garlic shrimp, once again rice was used as a side but this time it was not mixed in with anything, its purpose merely to balance out the taste of the plate and help a little with the digesting process.And finally moving on to his boss, Naoki's plate was not nearly as robust as the others at the table with only a small portion being visible. That was not to say that it was lacking in finery though, far from it in fact! Since he was aware that she would not wish to partake in too much food off the get go he deemed it fitting to give her a fruit parfait, something not too big and it looked classy to boot. He made sure as to put it in the best cup he could find and allowed only the shiniest silver spoon to pierce its nut coated shell and dive deep into its creamy goodness.Once finished handing everybody's food out Maelik took three steps back and swept into a low bow.\"Once again please do enjoy the meal, I shall return in a short while to clean up any empty plates and see if any of you will be requiring a desert to finish off your dinners.\" With that he shuffled away, never straightening from his bow and never turning his back... all the way down the stairs and then some.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Maelik slipped into the room carrying his massive load of food carefully balanced on his equally massive platter. \"Thank you for your patience sirs and madams, dinner is served.

Relax, allow me to assess any potential injuries.\u201dNaoki leans over and reaches into the top drawer of her bedside table with her unoccupied hand. She rummages around in the drawer, sliding books, loose pieces of parchment, and numerous small trinkets aside to obtain the object she seeks: a wide strip of black velvet, fastened on both ends to a string. A sleep mask, a blindfold; Naoki would often wear it to block out light and sleep more easily. \u201cI am concerned that you may have a concussion. I am going to put this over your eyes for a moment, and then check to see if your eyes are dilating properly.\u201dWith that said, Naoki leans over, and slides the mask down over the top of Kate\u2019s head, positioning the band of fabric to rest over her eyes. With the blindfold properly in place, Kate may find it hard to see through the opaque black fabric. And, presuming that she didn\u2019t suffer any sort of brain injury, her pupils would widen, attempting to adjust for the suddenly lowered light levels.Madame Naoki seats herself on the edge of the bed, and grasps Kate\u2019s hand again. The book had confirmed her recollections: the reason one falls unconscious in a situation such as this is due to irregular fluctuations in their heart rhythm, brought about by their stress, violent displeasure, or what have you. She figured that it would be prudent to monitor Kate\u2019s pulse, to ensure such irregularities have ceased. As such, she rests two fingers from her other hand on Kate\u2019s wrist as she sits for another precise minute, counting pulses.\u201cYour heart rate is fine. I\u2019m going to check your eyes, now.\u201dShe slides the blindfold up, to rest on Kate\u2019s forehead. Naoki leans forward, bringing her face down to hover just a handful of short centimeters from Kate\u2019s own, and stares intently into Kate\u2019s amber eyes, watching the pupil shrink as more light enters the aperture. The reaction seems in line with the norm, as stated by her book.However, Naoki finds herself lost in those amber globes, her own pupils widening, a response that has nothing to do with the light. She stares for several seconds longer than is necessary to accurately assess the functionality of Kate\u2019s pupillary response.After a few moments, Naoki reluctantly tears herself away, pulling back to sit upright on the edge of the bed. \u201cYour eyes are dilating properly, I believe.

I am going to put this over your eyes for a moment, and then check to see if your eyes are dilating properly.\u201dWith that said, Naoki leans over, and slides the mask down over the top of Kate\u2019s head, positioning the band of fabric to rest over her eyes. With the blindfold properly in place, Kate may find it hard to see through the opaque black fabric. And, presuming that she didn\u2019t suffer any sort of brain injury, her pupils would widen, attempting to adjust for the suddenly lowered light levels.Madame Naoki seats herself on the edge of the bed, and grasps Kate\u2019s hand again. The book had confirmed her recollections: the reason one falls unconscious in a situation such as this is due to irregular fluctuations in their heart rhythm, brought about by their stress, violent displeasure, or what have you. She figured that it would be prudent to monitor Kate\u2019s pulse, to ensure such irregularities have ceased. As such, she rests two fingers from her other hand on Kate\u2019s wrist as she sits for another precise minute, counting pulses.\u201cYour heart rate is fine. I\u2019m going to check your eyes, now.\u201dShe slides the blindfold up, to rest on Kate\u2019s forehead. Naoki leans forward, bringing her face down to hover just a handful of short centimeters from Kate\u2019s own, and stares intently into Kate\u2019s amber eyes, watching the pupil shrink as more light enters the aperture. The reaction seems in line with the norm, as stated by her book.However, Naoki finds herself lost in those amber globes, her own pupils widening, a response that has nothing to do with the light. She stares for several seconds longer than is necessary to accurately assess the functionality of Kate\u2019s pupillary response.After a few moments, Naoki reluctantly tears herself away, pulling back to sit upright on the edge of the bed. \u201cYour eyes are dilating properly, I believe. How do you feel? Do you remember hitting your head?\u201dKate grudgingly stand up and take the water and down it with one gulp, her hands were shaking as she extended the glass back to Artemis. She felt her heart skipping a beat when Naoki spoke about caring for her. Hihi! I should faint over more often!As she was being examined by Naoki, Kate lay back and subjected herself to Madame's treatment. She had learned to take care of her illnesses by herself, so the situation was strange (if not unpleasant) to her. She would blink as the blindfold was removed. \u201cSee anything you like, doc?\u201d Kate chirped and followed with a smirk. \u201cI don\u2019t mind you staring, but I really would like some food now.\"When Naoki moved, so did Kate, seating up with effort. When asked about her condition, Kate turns her head away, pursing her lips. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Don\u2019t worry. I don\u2019t think I hit my head.\u201d She rolled back on her back, setting her palm on her forehead and placing her legs on to the armrest. \u201cBut you know, it might have been my fault. I was too exited for the dinner and didn\u2019t have anything to eat today. I already felt woozy when I walked in and, well\u2026 I might have been asking for this.\u201dShe waved her hand on front of her face as to dismiss the whole ordeal as insignificant. \u201cBut never mind that. I was overreacting.\u201d Kate let out a disgruntled wheeze. \u201cShame about the carpet, though. I guess we need to dine elsewhere.

It was true, yes, very true, but that wasn\u2019t a very eloquent or witty way to word what she wanted to say. Rashness of emotion was getting in the way of her otherwise excellent speaking skill. She continues, trying not to dwell on her poor choice in phrasing. \u201cIn the time we spent apart, I met with a group of\u2026 adventurers? Business associates? I didn\u2019t get a very good read on who they were, or why, exactly, they were working together. Two men, Karath and Alden, and one girl, who wasn\u2019t introduced. I was approached in my office by Karath, he wanted to sell The Midnight Sun some mushrooms. Funny looking, pink mushrooms. Powerful psychedelic, he said. He left a sample- it\u2019s still on my desk. I\u2019d like to ask you to assess it later, and give me a reasonable unit price at which to purchase the rest of his stock.\u201dShe gestures with one hand to the doorway leading out into the office, where the pink mushroom still sits on the desk, perched atop a stack of books.\u201cThey seemed nice enough, though. As they lead me to understand, they\u2019re newcomers to Isra. The one of them, Alden, claimed that he was once a very skilled assassin. Very personable for an assassin, I think, even if his social skills were a bit... unrefined. Karath seemed perfectly polite, though he didn't\u2019 speak much at dinner. The girl was a bit strange, though. She wasn\u2019t introduced, and didn\u2019t speak so much as a single word in my presence. Something was off about her... I can\u2019t quite place what it was. Carried a strange sort of feeling about her that I didn\u2019t recognize.\u201dNaoki pauses here for a moment, thinking about Reyna. Naoki was often able to read people very well; the fact that she couldn\u2019t understand Reyna was both a bit strange, and slightly concerning to her. She doesn\u2019t dwell on it for long, though. A more important figure was present. \u201cAnyway, I provided them all lodgings, over in the Inn. It is my hope that they stick around for a while; they seem like a useful group I\u2019d like to work more with, perhaps employ.\u201dShe stands, takes Medical Maladies from where it was left on the edge of the bed, and places it on her bedside table. Madame Naoki\u2019s mind moves from one topic to the next very quickly; she doesn\u2019t often replace books on the shelf, instead preferring to leave them around on any available flat surface. To enable this habit, she\u2019s decorated her abode with a number of shelves, tables, desks, and the like. All covered in books, layers deep in places. She\u2019s nearly due to finally become fed up with books lying around everywhere and have another fit of organization, although the order introduced in that spree would be painfully short-lived.Sitting back down in her chair by the bed, she surveys the room. Her eyes slide from the piles of books, to Kate\u2019s wiggling feet. From the table where they were to eat, to Kate\u2019s heels, discarded to the floor. She bites her lip, considering whether or not to share what she\u2019s thinking. After a moment of hesitation, she starts, choosing each word carefully. \u201cYou know\u2026 I\u2019m not sure what I expected, out of today. I wasn\u2019t sure of myself, or how I felt. I wasn\u2019t sure how the events of today would affect me, or the future. And it can\u2019t be said, with that recent incident in mind, that everything went just as I would have liked.\u201dShe pauses here, again considering her words. \u201cBut I\u2019d like you to know. I really enjoyed the time we spent together today, even though there were a few bumps. I\u2019ve come to know both you, and myself, better. I thank you for today, it has been my best yet.\u201d\u201cNot only but that, but it\u2019s important to keep in mind, not only is the night still young, but so are we. Ulcicisor?

He wanted to make it the best dinner either of the women ever had, not only so that they could experience a roller coaster ride of taste and texture, but also because he really really really reeeeaallly wanted to look good at what he did.As such he chose only the richest of ingredients from his personal stores, in particular a fresh flank of elk, large and juicy and already marinated in a sweetened red wine with not an ounce of fat on it. But it would take more than a simple elk to satisfy the demon's craving for prime venison, it had to be special and Maelik made sure that it was something beyond extraordinary. He had taken extreme care in breeding a herd of the creature that he once acquired in a trade with a wizard, and in the Lord's opinion it was well worth the three days he spent bound to the decrepit old geezer before fulfilling his contract. From there he started to introduce some of the more exotic species he found on other planes of existence into the breeding stock, celestial variants being his favorite. What was produced from decades of strict care and a frankly unhealthy obsession was an animal enthusiast's dream, an elegant six pronged giant with the unearthly grace of the heavens and the obedience of a trained slave. But above all of that was the naturally sweet taste that came with their flesh, something that years upon years of eating bales made from select grains and crushed fruit seeds naturally ingrained into the sinew of the meat.The elk that this flank in particular came from was the cream of the crop, a true majestic beast that Maelik raised from birth up until the day it was at its physical peak before brutally and relentlessly brutalizing it with his bare fist until it became a nice tender corpse of unrivaled tastiness.Reverently setting it down upon a counter he set the fire in the stove, making sure that it was fueled by apple wood logs before transitioning over to the side dish, stuffed peppers with chard and scallions. The first step being the hollowing of the yellow peppers with his trademark sociopathic methodicalness, leaving nothing but the thick rind of the pepper. After that he set to boiling rice and the chard on separate burners and then switching his focus to the scallion onions, swiftly chopping the stalk with a flashing knife sharp of purest silver sharp enough to shave lead. Once the rice was cooked he proceeded to fry it with the onion stalks, adding a bit of garlic powder to the mix and stuffing all the components into the empty peppers and replacing the tops before finally letting them sit in the oven at a medium heat to finish up.After that he checked up on the elk and pulled it from the oven to fine tune the spices and sauces, lathering it with a fruit based meat sauce and placing it back in the stove for another minute or so to heat up the sauce and finish cooking the meat.All that remained was the traditional addition of bread, in this case a batch of dinner rolls with the butter cooked into the swirls of the roll itself accompanied by the thinnest hint of some sort of jam used sparingly in the baking process.Surprisingly it only took the chef extraordinaire only a mind boggling twenty minutes to create the whole thing, putting his special knowledge amassed from ages of study and utilizing his magic to maximize efficiency to do what most other chefs could only dream of doing.When it came time to choose the plates that would cradle his food babies to their destination Maelik went with a neutral porcelain dish and took painstaking care in placing the food out in three equal portions and not allowing even a stray drop to mar the aesthetic perfection of his masterpiece.And when the stars all aligned and the time of prophecy came to pass, the imposingly large monster from the nightmares of both child and adult alike skipped happily up the stairs with a cheery whistle on his scaly lips. He'd continue along until finally stopping just short of Naoki's door, doing his best to approach silently and listening at the door to find a good time to enter as he did not wish to ruin the mood once again. Besides, he had confidence that his magic could keep the food piping hot and perfectly preserved until such a time that it would be appropriate to step foot inside.The demon was almost salivating at the thought of the reception his food would get, and this time he hoped to see the whole thing go down in person.\"Then again,\" he thought, \"it may be detrimental to the overall experience if I was lurking in the corner and staring at them the whole time so it may just be best if I make myself scarce after that first bite. Yes, that would most likely be the best course of action... Maybe I should go and get some clothes made up or something? Or maybe go out and try to find a girl?

The door opens to reveal a room of approximately equal size to the office. The far wall is lined with shelves holding labeled boxes; the others sport tasteful tapestries, paintings, and other pieces of art. On the right-hand wall, an unobtrusive door of dark wood, with a silver doorknob. In the center of the room, an assortment of richly-upholstered couches and chairs circle a square coffee table. Under a protective lacquer finish, the top of the table is adorned with fantastic designs, swirls and geometries and patterns carved into the wood and covered with vibrant paint and gold leaf.

After receiving a negative response or fulfilling any other requests, she picks up the tray, and disappears into the doorway on the right of the room.The room's architecture is contiguous with that of the rest of the office, but the feel is much different. A tall wardrobe and a dresser sit side-by-side against the left wall. A queen-sized bed with blue bedclothes nestles in the far right corner, a short bookcase-endtable combination at its side. A large, sturdy desk, chair, and a locked chest occupy the wall to the right of the door. A simple, worn, gray woolen blanket lies neatly folded on the foot of the bed. A few assorted small portraits and other memorabilia lie in orderly fashion on top of the dresser. The room is simple, efficient, and comfortable. Artemis places the tray down on the desk, sits down, and regards the meal. Maelik really is an exceptional chef, she muses. The plate is a work of art itself, a feast even before a single utensil touches the food. Every element worked with the others in a seamless concerto of smells, colors, and visual textures. She lingers for some moments, simply staring at the plate. She finds herself almost reluctant to take a bite - it feels almost like taking a knife to a famous painting. Hunger and curiosity eventually drive her to take up the fork, however.The meat separates effortlessly under her touch, releasing an entirely new blast of fragrance as the sear is breached. She's almost quivering with excitement as she raises the bite to her mouth.The taste is everything she was expecting, and more. The meat is juicy, and impossibly tender. The depth of flavor is stunning in its intricacy. She sits there, stunned, for several seconds after swallowing, before reverently cutting another piece. The sensation is no less intense the second time.With barely-constrained anticipation, she prepares a bite of the stuffed pepper. The high standard set by the elk is fully met; the side dish is an insightfully conceived and perfectly executed masterpiece of texture, flavor, aroma, and visual appeal.

Almost of the knowledge I have, I have learned through personal experiences or books, and I\u2019ve never attempted to share my methods with anyone. The ways in which I try to tell you things may not make sense, or I might omit a critical detail I thought to be self-evident. I would like to apologize in advance for any awkwardness or misunderstanding by my methods due to lack of experience.\u201d\u201cWith that said, though, I\u2019m going to try my best. If you have any questions, just ask.\u201dTurning back to face the desk, she gestures to the papers lying before her, and the world at large, making small, focused movements with her hands as she speaks.\u201cAs you\u2019re well aware, I own and manage The Midnight Sun here. My duties relate to the administration of the establishment and the employees. It\u2019s my job to watch over everything, and make sure everyone else has what they need do their jobs properly.\u201d\u201cAllow me to preface the explaining the technical portion of explaining my job with a few words about my policies and business practices. And, allow me to preface that with a bit of my own history. In the earliest stages of my youth, I observed, and was made to be part of, a business; one that was not unlike this one, at least as far as the services offered went. However, there were a number of policies and fundamental parts of running that business that do not at all carry over to The Midnight Sun of today.\u201d\u201cTo put it bluntly, there was no respect. The employer did not respect his employees, the employees did not respect him, nor their fellow employees, or even the customers. The atmosphere was\u2026 toxic. People hated each other. Managers worked their task-force like slaves. Heck, in some cases, the employees weren't \u2018employees\u2019 by definition, but actual slaves, in the most literal sense of the word.\u201dShe pauses here, caught momentarily in memories of the past, before continuing.\u201cEveryone hated everyone else, there was more spite, discontentment and anger in everything done by that business than one could reasonably shake a stick at.\u201d\u201cThis atmosphere didn\u2019t stop things from functioning, outright. However, it was obviously apparent, even to those who were taking part, that the atmosphere of the company was massively detrimental. When people start murdering their superiors to take their place, it becomes difficult to sanely describe it as anything other than detrimental. Let it suffice to say, that company has long since been... dissolved... and I carry memories of it only as an example of how operations should not be run.\u201dNaoki pauses here, to assemble her next point. She twirls a quill between two fingers, the feathered end waving around in short, tight circles. \u201cHowever, my experiences there have influenced the way I run The Midnight Sun today. A business, at its most basic level, is a group of individuals working towards the same goal of providing a good or service to the public in exchange for currency. It is my belief, first and foremost, that any group of individuals seeking to work towards the same goal, must first respect each other. Only from that foundation of mutual respect, can greatness be born. Once that basic establishment of shared respect is laid, it becomes so much easier to work together effectively.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a staunch believer in the concept of holism. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts, and by promoting coordination and cooperation between individuals, the group can accomplish so much more than it would otherwise. The best way to conduct joint operations is to identify the strengths of each individual, and then intelligently assign tasks that would be best completed by that individual. It is this grand concept that is the philosophy that I founded The Midnight Sun today under, and is still the way I run it to this day.\u201d \u201cI realize, as I say, this, that it sounds a bit... specious. A bit pretentious. But one can hardly argue with the results. The fact of the matter is that, by using this set of ideals to conduct operations, the business not only runs, but does so with a massive degree of success, as is evident.\u201d\u201cDo you have any questions so far?\u201d", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Naoki waits for Skarlet to be seated, and turns slightly in her chair to address her."}, "post-19402": {"user": "Skarlet", "user_num": 257, "timestamp": "1450738733000", "message": "Skarlet nods as Naoki begins. \"Yes ma'am.\" She listened carefully to Naoki's history.

She finds herself unsure of the etiquette regarding vampires, and their transition. She decides to skim over it and continue. \u201cRight. Excellent. So, with those ideas in mind, I\u2019ve still got to do the actual business administration. My responsibilities include keeping track of each day\u2019s profits and expenses, paying, raising, and negotiating salaries for each employee, negotiating agreements, making executive decisions regarding operations, ensuring that every employee is aware of what is expected of them, and making sure that they have the tools they need to fulfill those expectations. Those are general descriptions of the most major things, and there are also an innumerable amount of smaller tasks to be done. Making sure each of our suppliers meets their end of our agreement, making sure they\u2019re paid for their materials. Checking to see that all of the goods and services we provide meet my expectations. There are tons of tiny jobs and daily maintenance things I do. I\u2019ll often offload some of the workload to Mr. Cresno, as he often finds himself with a lot of free time, but it\u2019s still a massive amount of dry, tedious work. I don\u2019t really find the itself work enjoyable, but it\u2019s what needs to be done for The Midnight Sun, and with it, all of us, to continue growing. With any luck, you\u2019ll take a liking to, and have a talent for this sort of thing, so I can have you do all of the most boring tasks!\u201dAt this, Madame Naoki chuckles, and lightly nudges Skarlet with her elbow jokingly, in a grand display of her poor sense of humor.\u201cOne of the things I do is write contracts. A contract, in the sense that I utilize the word, is a written agreement between two parties, usually between an employee or supplier and myself, that states that both parties agree to the terms of an agreement, which are laid out as the body of the contract. These contracts can have varying levels of detail, and may or may not include agreed upon consequences if the agreement of the contract is broken, or stipulations regarding the methods each party will use to meet their end of the deal.\u201d\u201cFor example, one term that I include in all of my employment contracts is such that if I am forced to cancel their appointment, through no fault of their own, I agree to pay them a sum equal to six months of their salary at the time of termination as a severance package, and make the parting of ways as painless as possible.\u201d \u201cAnother term I always include is one that states that the employee agrees to follow the local laws of Isra, in the state that they are at the signing of the contract. If one of my employees breaks the law, and is brought to justice in the eyes of the public, it reflects poorly on the business as a whole. Some may say that there is so such thing as bad publicity, but there\u2019s certainly undesirable publicity. The Midnight Sun will never be known as a bunch of criminals. Each term of each agreement has a purpose, and not all of the terms I could use are applicable to each contract. No two contracts are quite the same, and I\u2019ll often need to create new terms on the fly, to account for the unique conditions related to each employee.\u201d\u201cSeeing as how a significant portion employees have been with us for multiple years, and how rapidly the business, and the city are growing, I often find myself needing to update contracts. For each one, the process is mostly the same as the initial singing. I have to write the thing, and they have to read the new contract, and agree to it. Oftentimes, I won\u2019t rewrite the entire thing, just make a little, few page addendum to the last one, but that still requires a new signature. For example, today I need to update the contracts of those employees who are now chefs. Mr. Maelik has drafted some of the formerly part-time preparers of food into full time chefs under his direct instruction, and their contracts all need to be updated to reflect their change in job title, along with a few extra terms have in mind, regarding the preparation of the food. The understanding that they won\u2019t poison it, and such.\u201dShe gestures to a stack of papers on the desk. A cursory examination would reveal them to be employment contracts, of those mentioned individuals Maelik has drafted to be chefs. Next to them, a small, informal note has a few bullet points relating to the content of the addendums, written by Naoki to remind her what needs to be done.\u201cAllow me to guide you through the creation of one of these documents from beginning to end. And since you\u2019re here, why not your contract of employment? I don\u2019t usually draft contracts with the potential signee present, but I think that this is a fine exception. Perhaps by the time we\u2019re done, you\u2019ll want to fill in the job title as \u2018administrative assistant\u2019 or somesuch.\u201d\u201cThe first thing I always do is create an informal outline of the terms I\u2019d like to include, so I can put conscious thought into grouping the terms together with others like them, so the whole thing reads like one document, not a haphazardly thrown together collection of clauses. You can then use this later as a sort of table of contents. Let\u2019s start with a couple of standard terms, like the ones I mentioned earlier, and go from there.\u201dOver the course of the next two hours, Madame Naoki takes Skarlet on an adventure though the wild and whimsical world of creating legitimate legal documents, and in the process, drafts an employment contract for Skarlet. The process of creating a single document takes so long, not because Naoki is a slow writer, but rather because she pauses often to explain concepts to Skarlet. Fun and interesting things, like the importance and distribution of paid time off, contractual liability, percentage based raises, healthy and unhealthy workplace practices, and the proper way to write an expense report. (Even though expense reports have nothing to do with the task at hand.) It\u2019s an exhilarating task, really.\u201c...and I think that\u2019s about it. There\u2019s still a bit of work to be done, as far as job description, and the expectations and specifics of that job go, but this is a perfectly workable skeleton we can adapt to whatever job you\u2019d like to do.

I don\u2019t mind it too much. Most of the time, he can be trusted to sit down there in the basement, and do the work I need him to do, without exposing himself to everyone and their cousin, waving appendages everywhere. And even when he does display his\u2026 crass side, it\u2019s usually pretty harmless.\u201d\u201cHowever, Miss Green doesn\u2019t find it to be so.

Her clothes were left folded on the desk and she sat in the chair with the hosiery in her hands and carefully puts her feet in. She then slowly slides the dark silky material up her pale legs then stands up to pull them up to her waist. Skarlet looks down to inspect that they're on properly and smooth, the material felt nice and comfortable. She then puts on the cuffs, collar and tie before picking up the black suit part while stepping into the slippers. Bending over she puts each foot through the leg holes and pulls the suit up. As she pulls it up and the material slides over the hosiery and it hugs her bottom tightly, she must admit if feels exciting putting this outfit on. Pulling it further up past her abdomen, the fabric holds close to her body, the sheer fabric feeling like just another layer of skin. Once up to her busty chest, Skarlet tugs at the suit to pull it up more, at that moment it looks like there's not enough. She reaches down and slides her hands up the outfit a few times, making it come up higher but causing it to become tighter on her, squeezing her round booty a bit more. Now she's confident there is enough afterall and pulls it up under her arms and lifts the it up to fit her large breasts in the cups of the outfit. With a few extra tugs her nipples are safely covered and her bust has been lifted a bit, she plays with her tits a little to make sure they won't just come popping out of the outfit then looks back to check her butt, seeing now the fluffy tail attached to the suit just above her butt.She moved around a bit, this outfit felt really comfortable and made her feel excited. She reached down for the last part, a headband with two dark bunny ears on it. The girl slips the headband on top of her head and plays with the ears a little while making sure it was situated alright and wouldn't fall off. Skarlet now had the entire ensemble on and walked toward the door, she'd look down at herself again and see how revealing it actually looked! Anxiety welled up inside her now as she placed her hand on the doorknob, she was frozen there for a few moments, unsure if she should really go out there or put her clothes back on. Finally she works up the courage and opens the door to head downstairs....Skarlet felt very embarrassed walking downstairs, feeling like she was wearing nothing at all. She worried about everyone's reactions to her appearance, what would they think of her? Skarlet walked timidly over to where she saw the Madame and Artemis, flustered and feeling eyes all over her. She didn't know what to do with her hands, pressing her two index fingers together nervously, \"M-m-madam N-Naoki, I'm h-here. I-I got dressed like you asked. Is th-this really okay to wear?

Then, it was life as a possession, meant to keep silent in the background.Thank every god from all beliefs that disease took that old man. On the eve after his departure, she just took his equipment, hammered it to her own size, and left home.Her hand clenched around the locket as the memories flooded back. Not happening, conscious repeated.Yes it is, said conscience. It's the only way to find him.Waaaaiiit, he said it was needed to keep the energy topped up. I'm gonna ask what he means. Reiea started, as if about to speak.She quickly hesitated, and bit her lip. Conscience asserted, No. Don't ask too many questions. Just go and find the man.You can't tell me what to do! wailed conscious. Reiea straightened herself, loosened her grip on the locket, and inquired of Reese, \"Just what powers it? I mean, why must I wear it?

Two portions of paper lazily drift to rest side by side on the desk\u2019s surface. At this impressive display of quality, Madame Naoki\u2019s eyebrows raise. What extraordinary fortune she was experiencing of late, regarding skilled individuals. He said he could do weapons- swords, as well. This man sitting before her is not only, as evidenced, very skilled at his craft, but is also an immense tactical asset. One that she would have no trouble justifying.Finished with her appraisal, she slides the knife back across the desk to Artaxerxes.\u201cImpressive. I will employ you, if you\u2019ll accept my employment. Allow me a moment to prepare the necessary paperwork.\u201dMadame Naoki slides back in her chair, and begins rummaging in the desk\u2019s drawers. From within, she extracts a small handful of half-completed employment contracts. \u201cThere are a few things you should be aware of, before entering into any sort of agreement here. Being employed by The Midnight Sun is more than just that. Not only do we provide food, lodgings, and other benefits, but by signing on with us, you also agree to a number of other things. To become a part of our family, as it were. These contracts here, they outline the terms exactly, but the gist of it is such that you agree not to work against the wishes of the organization at large, agree to respect your employees, and do your best at your job. Oh, and you can\u2019t break the local law. You are, of course, free to read them all in their entirety, but that\u2019s a succinct summary, I think.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re a bit more than just a business, I think you can understand.\u201dShe gives Artaxerxes a particular sort of look, that lets on a bit of what she\u2019s trying to imply. Based on what he said of his past work experience, she thinks that he\u2019ll follow.After a minute more of writing, Naoki slides the documents, now mostly completed, across the desk at Artaxerxes for his reading and signing. One is a form, that asks some things about the subject. Name, birthplace, age, and the like. Another is the formal contract of employment, that would employ Artaxerxes as a \u2018Sharpening Officer\u2019, and pay him a fairly generous salary for \u2018fulfilling the duties expected of The Sharpening Officer\u2019. It also goes into some terms about not wronging the family, and such.The last contract is an explanation of benefits and additional terms. He is to be provided with food, lodgings, clothing and the like, as well as a nice health and dental plan, among other things.\u201cIs there anything I should be aware of when striking a deal with you? Do you have any unique conditions, or quirks I should know about? Will you need any equipment, or special accommodations to do your job?\u201d", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Naoki takes the knife from the desk carefully, by the handle.

One the way down the stairs, she considers which rooms are still available. A side-effect of such a massive employee growth was such that they were running out of rooms. Only a handful of second-floor quarters remain unoccupied. Leading Cyronin to one of these empty rooms, she opens the door, and steps inside. <br/><br/>The room is square, nine meters to a side, walls and floor of wood. A single, naked bed sits in one corner. A tall wardrobe and dresser sit to either side of the bed. In another corner, a square table is flanked by two wooden chairs. Next to the door, a small painting of some mountains hangs over a sturdy chest. A circular gray carpet sits in the middle of the floor, and few more bits of furniture and living accommodations fill out the remaining wall space.

She had heard a lot about it as of late. Perhaps she would have to visit sometime soon. Or, maybe not, she muses, as an image of her nearly-overflowing wardrobe passes through her mind. \u201cWell, as far employment goes, you've got a lot of options. You mentioned the last time we spoke, you have a background in assassination and covert operations. If you\u2019d like to continue in that line of work, I know a group that would make excellent use of those talents. Their business practices are on par with my own; their mission is one that I admire, and one that I think you may also appreciate. I could easily put you in touch with their administration; and I have no doubt, with how you described your accumulated experiences, that they would have little trouble justifying your employment.\u201d\u201cBut, you also said that you were looking for a job in another profession, one without killing. Which is where the options begin to appear. And as I mentioned, I\u2019m fairly well acquainted with most of the best businesses here in the city, and run the best one myself. If you\u2019d like to take part in what we do here at The Midnight Sun, there are always openings for operations personnel. Wait staff, cooks, dishwashers, bouncers, table managers, card dealers, that sort of thing. Or, if you\u2019d prefer, I\u2019ve recently begun hiring multitalented individuals such as yourself as Operatives, paying them to hang around and help in whatever ways they\u2019re able. The needs of the group vary a lot, day to day, so it\u2019s helpful to have a handful of competent individuals around who are prepared to fill in for others, do odd jobs and the like.\u201cAlternately, you might consider working with Mr. Cresno, across the hall. He does a lot of work with gathering information from around and making it usable to us. However, one thing he lacks is a proper set of eyes.\u201dShe chuckles a bit, at the anatomical joke she didn\u2019t intend to make before clarifying.\u201cI mean to say, I\u2019m not suggesting that you look at things for him because he can\u2019t see, but rather, that he\u2019s a spymaster without a spy. Your skills would be very useful to him, I think. That may be a good fit, because your skills of concealment would be put to excellent use, but not necessarily to bring harm to others.Naoki pauses for a moment, considering how much information she\u2019d like to share with Alden. She decides to keep things vague, lowering her voice a bit to signify the semi-classified nature of her words, glancing sidelong at Davous, to ensure he\u2019s still asleep.\u201cAnd if that sounds a bit dull for your taste, you might consider sticking around for a little while. Keep this following information to yourself, but sometime in the near future, we\u2019re going to be expanding our operations into a new area, and I think you would be very well suited for the sort of work we\u2019ll be doing soon. I think it would align neatly with the desires to do good you spoke about before. I would be happy to cover your expenses as an Operative until that time when the job I have in mind becomes available.\u201dRaising her voice to a normal level again, she continues. \u201cAs I said, I\u2019m also in touch with a bunch of excellent businesses around the city who may be looking for employees. If one of them strikes your fancy in your wanderings, you need only ask. There\u2019s a particular botanist I know; Miss Green, I believe I mentioned her in our earlier meeting. She might be interested in hiring an assistant to help with things around her greenhouse, although she hasn\u2019t specifically mentioned looking for one. It might be worth asking, if you\u2019re interested in botany as a profession. As she speaks, she waves the bottle of ink around. The contents slosh around within their container, providing inky emphasis to her words.\u201cOh, and as one last possible path of action, if you\u2019ve got the mind to start your own business, in whatever field, I would likely be willing to invest in whatever... entrepreneurial\u2026 venture you may have in mind.\u201dSetting the bottle of ink down on the desk, she leans back in the chair and considers for a moment, before concluding her piece. \u201cThat\u2019s all of the options I can think of at the moment. If you were to ask for my personal suggestion, I would suggest that you sign on as an Operative until the other job I mentioned becomes available, or work with Mr. Cresno. At the risk of sounding arrogant, I truly believe that from an empirical standpoint, the benefits of working with the Midnight Sun far outweigh the benefits of working elsewhere.

He wasn't sure if working for a botanist or another business would work out exactly, he may not want to be an assassin anymore, but it was also all he knew.

Connected to the primary roads of the city by an alley wide enough to fit two carriages side-by-side,  it is here that The Sun\u2019s many suppliers bring their wagons full of supplies. Each day, many carts piled high with alcohol, fruit, vegetables, freshly butchered meat, and other ingredients unload their contents through wide, sliding doors into the small warehouse attached to the rear of The Sun.Today, however, instead of any small supplier\u2019s cart, carrying fruit baskets or whiskey, a new and unusual vehicle stands in the alley. It is a carriage, in the technical sense, in that it is a box, drawn along by wheels, by a beast of burden. It is at this point that any comparison stops. The sheer scale of the carriage, if it can be called that, dwarfs any previous bearer of the word. Where one would normally find wooden wheels, perhaps a meter tall, held together with spokes, here, you find six thick metal discs, each standing a full three meters tall. The body of the vehicle itself is a massive, boxy looking thing, paneled with dark metal plates. Along the side, circular windows sit in a row, each about the size of a dinner plate and surrounded by a ring of reinforced metal. A large Midnight Sun logo has been painted on one of the larger panels. On the rear of the coach, a ladder has been placed below the door, leading to a small platform to allow passengers easy movement into the interior. The angular metal and thick lines of the construct give off a feeling of effortless, unlimited strength.Instead of a standard team of horses or oxen, a single beast stands at rest in front of the carriage. It measures a full half meter tall, barely coming up to one\u2019s waist. It seems to be a miniature horse. Appearing exactly as a horse would, but\u2026 small. The body of the pony, at least what can be seen around the harness, is a light brown, lacking dapples or pattern, and its mane is a darker shade of brown.A great system of straps, ropes, rods and bracings connect the diminutive beast to the titanic bulk of the vehicle, making for a strange dichotomy. That any single animal short of a dragon possesses the strength to pull the great iron carriage beggars imagination. Even so, as the beast stands patiently in its harness, the whole system moves with it, reacting to even the smallest idle movement of its head, betraying some hidden incredible strength. Some railings are visible around the top of the vehicle, suggesting that one can stand on the top. And indeed, though it isn\u2019t visible from the ground, a small hatch allows access to the roof from inside. Additionally, on the top of the carriage, towards the rear, a metal construction of some sort is embedded into the roof. Though it doesn\u2019t seem to serve any purpose at the moment, it may be possible to mount some sort of device there later.As Skarlet and Cyronin would likely approach, Madame Naoki can be seen through the open door in the rear of the cabin, inspecting something on the wall. Artemis is standing at the bottom of the ladder, hands clasped behind her back. As Naoki sees the two approaching through her peripheral vision, she turns and waves enthusiastically at the pair.\u201cHey, you two! Check this thing out!\u201dShe gestures around, obviously referring to the vehicle.

Hopefully, before Benny gets here with his ten o\u2019clock pork delivery.\u201dShe retreats into the interior of the cabin, expecting the two to come up the ladder. The interior of the cabin is furnished surprisingly well, considering the borderline militaristic exterior. To either side of the entryway, there\u2019s an amount of partitioned storage, perhaps for storing suitcases and the like in. Beyond that, it opens up, into the primary sitting area. Two long couches line the walls, and a raised surface sits between them, serving as a table. The couch cushions are removable, revealing empty space within the couch to store things. Cabinets line the lower regions of the table. A door in the opposite wall leads forward, presumably toward more rooms. It\u2019s evident that the vehicle is designed to provide safe transit for a small group of people over long distances. To use it for small errands like this is perhaps overkill, but that doesn\u2019t seem to bother Madame Naoki, as she reclines on one end of the long couches, and speaks again. \u201cIsn\u2019t this great? So roomy! Like I said, we\u2019re going to go visit the citadel.

The demon used his own demonic flame as the catalyst for the cake's rising and took painstaking care when creating the chocolate icing, the cocoa beans that formed its backbone would inject the cake with a small amount of caffeine as was the norm. However since from what Maelik could tell from Raulio was that the man was looking for a jolt the demon was sure to add an additional base of coffee beans that would add a slightly bitter taste. To combat this he had to increase the ratio of cocoa beans in relation to everything else to offset the taste to better suit the richness of the chocolate. It was a delicate procedure, requiring a careful hand, a precise eye for measurements and decades of experience.When the cake itself was done the Lord moved on to brewing a batch of simple coffee, only adding a small dose of peppermint to compliment the choco-goodness of the cake and soften the bitterness of the coffee.Assuming that the Fletcher stayed close by Maelik would personally deliver the treat to him and offer him his most heartfelt thanks in choosing the Sun for his culinary craving.\"Consider this one on me, it's my deepest pleasure to serve another who may understand how it feels to express one's self in an artistic medium.

Unable to do so, he allows himself to be entranced by the sheer, geometrical perfection that lay before him. It was a perfectly shaped cake. He leaned in for closer inspection, desperately searching for flaws. There was nary an out of place air bubble in the icing, a single stray crumb anywhere on the plate. It was so uniform, so perfect, an effluence of divinity itself.How was this possible? Raulio respected all forms of art, from the lowly crafting of a young teenager's angst-ridden haikus to the grand, lifetime consuming spectacles that bedazzled the finest of cathedrals. But this cake, this work of art, was created by an entity who only pursued but one single branch, but pursued it to such terrifying extremes as to be able to make... this... this chocolate gemstone.His hand trembled as his fork approached the cake. He almost hated to destroy its perfection. But the art of food was by its very nature fleeting. Food could not last. Its very purpose was to paint memories and sensations rather than to exist itself. Raulio almost wanted to say a prayer for the cake, blessing it for its valiant sacrifice, for to achieve its full potential, it must be destroyed!He dug into the cake, prying apart its delicate warm flesh. It was so... so willing. It was begging to be eaten. He could almost hear the spoonful's triumphant cries of martyrdom as it so valiantly flew into his mouth. He took the bite.Darkness. Deep, sinful, darkness. Everything was darkness. But this wasn't an ordinary darkness. It was... warm, loving, deep. It was bitter, but sweet. It graced his tongue like a melancholic poet, trying desperately to bestow the wisdom of her tortured soul as it entered the gates of death and nirvana. The bitterness of despair and cocoa, the sweetness of love and sugar. And once more, there was light. There was a light at the end of the void. This darkness, this sinful darkness, a darkness that he never wanted to leave anymore than a man madly in love with the poet would dare leave her bedside in her darkest moments, it gave way to a light. But how?The frosting. It was the frosting. How was this possible? The creamy, tangy frosting. It was light-hearted and playful. In contrast with the dark, vampiric nature of the cake itself, the frosting told a story of light, a... sunrise, a kind visitor, a respite from the all-consuming and otherwise addictive blackness that so lovingly embraced his soul. Combined, the chocolate cake and its frosting told a wonderful tale which captured the entire human experience.This bite, this singular bite, had taught Raulio the meaning of of love and compassion, of understanding, of inner peace, of enlightenment.And then he swallowed. It was over.Raulio was in tears. \"That... that was beautiful.\" He contemplated what he had experienced, and suddenly shook his fist at the heavens!\"You've done it! I have been inspired!

And in her recent trip to The Citadel, Madame Naoki had wasted no time in purchasing a number of prime locations. A small stack of deeds were already safely filed away with other like documents, and she plans to make more acquisitions once she has more information about the area. Resting in the center of the desk, is an old, yet carefully preserved bit of parchment: a sketch. One of Naoki\u2019s own, drawn some number of years ago. It depicts a house. A rather nice house at that, from several angles. She had attempted- with what limited knowledge of drafting she could garner from some outdated, secondhand tome, to professionally depict a home. The drawing features many peaked roofs, and large, spacious rooms. As she sits, considering her old work, Naoki chuckles inwardly at her naivety. She had paid no heed to structural integrity. If constructed, each and every one of those wide open rooms would collapse, unable to support a ceiling without any sort of bracing or pillars. She had also completely declined to include any sort of kitchen or food storage. Hardly something she could hand over to a construction team. The third document is a long scroll, upon which Madame Naoki is creating a list. A few of the items under the heading \u2018Study\u2019 are as follows.Wraparound deskFreestanding fireplaceConnection to M.Bed and libraryNumerous sturdy shelvesCabinet for chess setAs she constructs this list of lists, she often finds herself wondering.  How would one go about building a greenhouse? What sorts of materials could a fireplace be constructed of? What exactly went into building a professional kitchen, and how wide ought the counters to be?Hmm. She would need to consult others. Filing the land deed and drawing away into the closest available drawer, she takes her list, quill and a small bottle of ink. These items in hand, she exists her office, and descends down to the first floor. On the way down the stairs, she performs her habitual overlook of the bar, though her mind is elsewhere. Things seem to be running smoothly enough. She makes her way back to the kitchen. Pushing the door open with her elbow, Naoki pauses for a moment on the threshold to fully appreciate the assortment of  appetizing aromas that characterize the kitchen. She reflects for a moment, on the immense leap in quality that recently affected the kitchen, and the individual who heralded it, as well as the incredible boost in business that the expert chefs have brought about. However, a cursory examination of the chefs currently working their unique brand of magic reveals no horns, black scales, or any of the other very distinctive characteristics that make obvious the presence of the individual she seeks.Her musing is interrupted as a server approaches from behind, with a polite request to be pardoned. Naoki returns an approving nod, and steps aside, out of the kitchen door. The server continues into the kitchen, likely to obtain their next set of meals to serve.She bites her lip. He must be out. Hm. Well. She didn\u2019t have much else planned for the day, and it was about time for a snack, anyway.Quill and paper still in hand, Madame Naoki selects a vacant table near the kitchen entrance, and selects a seat at that table that allows her an excellent vantage of the main entryway. Though she doesn\u2019t usually take dine on the first floor, she figures it might be an interesting change of pace from the silence of her quarters. As a member of the wait staff approaches, Naoki politely requests a plate of cookies. Before long, they arrive, still warm from the oven. Over the course of the next short while, Madame Naoki would sit there, in her seat near the kitchen, cookie in one hand, quill in other, her gaze wandering from the page before her to the bar around, alternating between making additions to her list, and scanning the room. In addition to watching the door for Maelik's return, she also keeps her gaze tuned for Raulio. A few days have passed since her delivery, and she hasn\u2019t heard from him since. He\u2019s likely caught up in his work, she supposes. He seems the sort to get caught up in his art. Though, she would like to commission the work she mentioned at their first meeting sometime soon. She finds the whole situation rather pleasant, taking a measure of pride in each and every satisfied customer and transaction that takes place around her, finding satisfaction in watching the business she's built operate, and knowing that she would soon leverage that success to actualize one of her oldest aspirations.

If he ever learns to fully harness that\u2026 thing\u2026 She shudders at the thought, and pushes it from her mind. Apparently, the beastman downstairs seeks an audience with her. Standing upright, and wincing at the action, Naoki waddles over to one of her wardrobes, and selects a dress; a rather simple, sleeveless blue one, lacking any real texture or pattern.

Panicked, she glances up to either side, checking the tops of the bookcases flanking the door, half expecting to see an army of resentful rods descend on her from above to have their revenge. Amber globes flick from surface to surface, checking for mad members. Seeing none, other than the prominently curved subject still sitting on her desk, Naoki relaxes. Striding over to the desk, she takes a moment to examine the tool. Hm. Not one of theirs. A cautious hand reaches out to grasp it, dextrous fingers reaching around to grasp the girth. She recoils, caught off guard by the texture. Pulling back, she looks at the residue left on her hand. She sniffs. Is that\u2026 chocolate? Despite the best efforts of her danger-sense, Naoki sticks one finger into her mouth. Chocolate. Good chocolate, at that. Cleaning the rest of her fingers, Naoki considers the veined sculpture again, silently cursing the approaching visitor. This would have to wait. Taking a clean cloth from a cabinet, Naoki first cleans the rest of her hand, before moving to carefully grasp the base of the chocolate replication with the rag, attempting not to distort the shape or marr the craftsmanship as she takes the thing over to the door of the dungeon.

Madame Naoki stands to meet them on the threshold, and nods to Aithen, then to Kevin in silent greeting. As she does, she subtly takes stock of Aithen. A different sort of cat-person.

We run this establishment, where the citizens of Isra can come, and exchange their currency and goods for the best food and drink available.

Regardless of race, history, or any of that, if an individual agrees to abide by Isranian law, they are welcome. I take that ideology of acceptance to a rather extreme degree here at The Sun. The only characteristics that matter to me are characteristics relating to one\u2019s character. If one is willing to cooperate with us, abide by our rules, and work toward our general goals, all are welcome within The Midnight Sun. I employ demons, monsters, flesh abominations, and vampires, among other sorts. And they all are both loyal and content with my leadership.

For example, our head hostess, Miss Skarlet. She was encountered by one of our associates\u2026 a few months ago now, alone, starving. Lacking a home, a job, a family, and companionship. She has found all of those, as well as a feeling of contentment here at The Midnight Sun.

Another terrible disappointment.The family artifacts had been a compilation of enchantments, the development of which had been a life's work. This was all well and good, but his life was quite noticeably over. He now had, in theory, multiple lifetimes to perfect his craft. Rational thought like that did nothing to cast aside impatience, and perhaps a bit of trepidation.A transition from life to undeath required many sacrifices. Emotion was lost, each day becoming a quagmire of choices based on logic and calculation. The flesh had melted off the bone, denying basic physical pleasure of any sort. No longer could he enjoy meals, the breeze against the skin, the warmth of a fire.The only remnant of the person he had once been was the mind. His entire existence was now based upon scholastic and philosophical pursuits. There was an infinite amount to learn out in the wide world, a world of systems social and governmental, moral and societal. The though that his mind might not be as capable of innovation as it once was, that indeed it could be slowly degrading, was absolutely terrifying.Enough. Contemplation of this nature is a distraction from delicate work. Reese tore the thoughts away and sequestered them into the back of his mind. They were certainly something to ponder later, but not while he was attempting to be industrious.Crystal was a perfect medium through which one could channel magical energy. The repetitive, predictable patterns allowed the path of the power to be calculated almost to perfection. It was difficult to find a gem that had no imperfections to divert that power, but once that was done, all manners of enchantments could be constructed within the interior.Parts of Reese's former work could be applied here. The portion designed to siphon energy from the owner or host would do quite well to power it. The difficulty came in binding other spells into the gem, in such a way that the weaves would all mesh together in a coherent, functional manner.

He would have to make apologies afterwards, but he was so very close to success!Mere minutes later, Reese discovered the problem. One of the clarifying strands was being routed through a power stream. He carefully teased it out and sent it spiralling through the inside of the gem, binding it to the proper thread. With breath that would have been bated, had he lungs, a bit of magical energy was channeled into the device.The first thing Reese noticed was a conspicuous lack of an explosion. This immediately set the newest attempt apart from the others. He gently lifted it before an empty eye socket and examined it carefully.

The aromas of cooking food waft over, rudely reminding Naoki that she hasn\u2019t yet eaten today. She places a hand on her midsection, and glances over to one of the nearby tables, where some manner of potato and cheese dish is steaming away. She feels another small pang of pity for Skarlet, for she would never be able to fully appreciate the unparalleled quality of Maelik\u2019s cooking- or even the cooking of his chefs, which is usually nearly as good.

Just no fairy dust spices or... imp-bacon or any of that nonsense.\u201d Naoki waves her hand dismissively, referring to those sorts of unorthodox ingredients. Her distaste for mythical animals stems from the same incident in which her distaste for seafood is rooted, one particular occasion wherein Artemis had caught some manner of exotic magical fish. Ordinarily, she would have shied away from eating something rainbow-colored with two tails, but hunger does strange things to one\u2019s sense of edibility. The fish tasted great going down, but gave them indigestion and nightmares for weeks. She realizes that one of the wait staff would probably say something if she requests something that she wouldn\u2019t be able to stomach, so as not to earn her ire\u2026 but there\u2019s no harm in making doubly sure.\u201cYou going to have anything, Artemis?\u201d Naoki speaks to Artemis without facing her, turning to glance around at which tables might be empty and suitable for their dining activities.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Naoki nods slowly, somewhat disappointed with Skarlet\u2019s response.

I was just going to pop over and let you know that I needed to speak with you, but you seem to have saved me the trip.\u201dFrom the corner of Naoki\u2019s peripheral vision, Raulio saunters up to the table, prepared to leave. Keeping in mind the active silencing spell, she raises a single finger in his direction, and mouths two words at him. \u2018One moment.\u2019Trusting Raulio to be seated again and not try to lip-read the rest of the conversation, she returns her focus to Maelik. \u201cThank you. I would be happy to answer any question you might have, to the best of my ability. And, when I\u2019m done, I have a few questions of my own. But let\u2019s start with yours. Everything has been going swimmingly in your absence. No complaints regarding the kitchen, and when I checked in yesterday afternoon, all day shift chefs reported no problems.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t\u2026 believe there have been any policy changes while you\u2019ve been gone. At the very least, I haven\u2019t made any sweeping, company level changes to the way things are done. Though, something may have slipped my mind. If you give me a hint as to what prompted the question, I could probably give you a more satisfying answer.\u201dSinking down into her seat, Naoki idly begins to braid a lock of her hair as she speaks. Left over center, right over center, as her hands maintain constant motion. \u201cThe Black Tower is a militarily inclined and combat-oriented sort of organization, whose publicly stated goal is to maintain world peace, and deal with any troublemakers where the nations of the world find themselves unable. They have assembled a team of some of the most powerful individuals around, and dispatch them to deal with major incidents and national criminals and the like. Almost like a vigilante organization, in that they\u2019re not associated with or bound by the rules of any nation, but not quite, in that they are, in some ways, more powerful than the nations themselves. Currently, in addition to their primary base of operations, the titular Black Tower, which you\u2019ve surely seen out in the plains,\u201dShe gestures with a nod of her head in a direction behind, and slightly to Maelik\u2019s left. If one were able to walk straight in that direction, through all of the walls, buildings, and other obstructions of Isra, they would eventually find themselves at the foot of the Black Tower. \u201c... they also have a branch headquarters over in Gauldin, which is where you were taken to recover. The interesting bit, though, comes in how they\u2019re related to us. The Black Tower is a child organization of The Midnight Sun, almost like The Moonlight Eclipse. We fund them, their bills are paid by the profit of this establishment. They have their own management structure, lead by Grandma, but ultimately, the whole thing falls into my dominion, should I decide to command it. I utilized one of their agents to deescalate your fight with Zuu, and requested that Lum'Valia bring you to the local tower to recover, which she did. I had the garrison of the local tower clear a room for your recovery, and had medical staff on standby in the event that Lum'Valia wouldn\u2019t be able to fully address your injuries. Fortunately enough, though, she was, and the medical staff were unnecessary.\u201dFinished with her braid, Naoki glances around for something to secure it with. Not having the presence of mind to have brought a ribbon or any sort of string, she shrugs in defeat, and tosses it back over her shoulder, where it will doubtless unravel itself over the course of the next hour or so. \u201cI should probably mention, even though it may have been obvious, either at the time, or based on what I just said, I was watching and managing the entire affair of your fight and the events that came afterwards from here. I notified Lum'Valia of your predicament, and guided her to your location so that she could assist, as well as directing the forces of The Black Tower to further aid you. Unfortunately, your assailant managed to escape the operatives I assigned to her destruction, and is still at large. It also goes without saying, please keep the nature of the relationship between The Midnight Sun and The Black Tower under your helmet. I prefer that the two remain separate for political reasons.\u201dReaching over to the end of the table, the latest object of Naoki\u2019s unending fiddling is a salt shaker. Placing her palm over the opening, she rotates it slowly, watching the salt slide around within the glass shaker. \u201cTo answer your next question, last night, Lorelei and Lucia attempted homicide. They attempted to kill Miss Moonflower L\u00e0idir, who turns out to be a personal friend of Alden\u2019s. When asked, they admitted to trying it, and I explained to them exactly why they shouldn\u2019t go around killing people, and how angry Alden was with them. Which is to say, very. They seemed to take my words to heart, and I don\u2019t think that they\u2019ll be attempting murder again, at least as far as Miss Moonflower is concerned. As soon as we\u2019re finished speaking, I\u2019m going to drop by her shop, apologize for the twins\u2019 actions, and put into place a few security measures on her establishment. They didn\u2019t give me any trouble when I was speaking with them, and as long as they don\u2019t try something similar in the future, I will consider the matter closed and dealt with in an agreeable manner.\u201dFinished with the salt shaker, she sets it back in its place, and dusts the salt off of her hand into the ashtray sitting at the end of the table.

A beautiful, large, house\u2026 mansion, chalet,  up in the Nokari Mountains. I had it built as a sort of vacation home, and plan on taking Miss Green up there some time soon, but I would like to offer its halls to you. It\u2019s a very cozy sort of place, very secluded. If you had need of such a location, perhaps to take Miss Lum\u2019Valia, for a little sort of\u2026 vacation\u2026 or for your own, personal relaxation, feel free. It\u2019s a great place. You can consider it an employment benefit if you\u2019d like. The kitchen is done exactly to your standards, and perhaps when I end up taking Miss Green up there, you might enjoy coming up and doing some cooking and the like. I\u2019m not sure. These are suggestions, do what you will, but know that you\u2019re welcome in any home of mine.\u201d\u201cBeyond that, I have nothing more that I feel that we need to discuss as this current moment, though my invitation for further training remains open, whenever you\u2019d like to continue.

The glowing symbol on the table fades, and the standard cacophony of The Midnight Sun returns, the loud and boisterous shouts of its patrons, the clinking of glasses and silverware.Madame Naoki stands, and after Artemis exits the booth, follows suit. She addresses Raulio, wherever he might be waiting in proximity.\u201cThank you for waiting. I didn\u2019t anticipate all of these delays. However, I must apologize, but there is going to be a brief detour on our trip. I need to visit a particular shop in the city, and speak with its owner. It shouldn\u2019t  take long, though. In the interest of proceeding with all due speed, allow me to excuse myself to go change. We\u2019ll be back in just a moment- meet you at the front door.\u201dWith that said and a nod given, Madame Naoki and Artemis proceed to the rear of the bar area, and out of sight up the stairs. A short while thereafter, the pair arrive at the front door, prepared for the trip. Artemis is the designated backpack carrier, the large canvas pack held on her back with a pair of straps. It bulges in a few places, obviously full of supplies. Meanwhile, Naoki carries a strange contrivance; a wrought iron lantern hanging from the end of a polished crook. However, instead of the customary candle or flame inside the lantern, an orange, tetragonal crystal is affixed.Additionally, Naoki has changed from of her Midnight Sun \u2018uniform\u2019 into some more comfortable traveling clothes. A deep blue, knitted sweater, and a pair of fine leather boots. As good as the uniform looks, and as excellent a word as \u2018peplum\u2019 is, the thing is simply uncomfortable to wear for any length of time. Very much a dress uniform, not something Naoki will be wearing for the fun of wearing it. With a wave of her hand, she directs the group into the entryway of The Midnight Sun, but stops just short of the door. \u201cNearly prepared to leave, allow me to activate this.\u201dIn her boots, Naoki finds it awkward to stand on her toes to reach up into the lantern, and instead tilts the crook downwards to allow her to easily reach the interior of the lantern. Holding the crook in one hand- carefully, she reaches a finger inside, and gently presses against the surface of the crystal. It sizzles, and wisps of smoke rise from the point of contact. A sharp intake of breath, and Naoki instinctively withdraws her finger and moves her other hand to clutch it. CLANG. The sound of dropped lantern hitting stone floor is muffled slightly, as it smashes into the toe of Naoki\u2019s boot, but is still loud enough to echo through the vestibule of The Midnight Sun. \u201cOH FOR- \u2026 \u201dNaoki bites her lip, bends her knees, and quietly seats herself on the floor. She sits there for a moment, knees up to her chest, rocking forward and backward on her heels, one hand in the other, both clutching the toe of her boot. She stares directly ahead, and silently curses Reese and his understatement. \"Sting a bit\", he said. She speaks in a curt, measured tone from her place on the floor, \u201cDon\u2019t touch me, please.\u201d\"Sting a bit.\", he said. But wait! With her uninjured left hand, she reaches across the front of her body, into the small pouch hanging on her right hip. She probes the contents of the pouch cautiously, attempting to select a gem from inside based on shape alone. After a moment or so of careful selection, she pulls out a small gemstone. An ascher cut ruby. She thinks back to what else Reese had said, regarding the spells attached to each type of gem in her bag. \u201cRuby for vigor.\u201dHoping that she hasn\u2019t misremembered his instructions, Naoki clutches the gem in her left palm, and activates it. A slight reddish shimmer envelops her hand, and spreads, dissipating across the rest of her body. Almost immediately, the pain fades from both her finger and toes, courtesy of the gem\u2019s magic. She holds her right finger up, and examines the tip, where it had touched the lantern-gem. No red mark, no cauterized flesh, nothing. Just her finger, perfectly fine and unseared. Placing her hand across the toe of her boot, she wiggles her toes within the boot, and finds them all fully functional and surprisingly unmangled. Amazing. Reese\u2019s gemcraft is potent, if nothing else. Replacing the ruby in her pouch, drawing the drawstring shut again,  and picking the lantern up from the floor, she stands, and dusts herself off. \u201cI\u2019m fine. That smarts a bit, but I\u2019m fine.\u201dIt is at this moment that the effects of the lantern become obvious. Now activated, the tall orange crystal glows brightly, illuminating the entryway of The Sun with ease, the tinted glow drowning out the soft yellow candles mounted on the walls. Additionally, the more easily noticeable effect is the heat. The lantern positively radiates with heat, the temperature within the vestibule begins to creep upwards at an appreciable pace. Naoki holds the lantern at arms length, and shields her face with her other hand. \u201cThis is a specially made sort of lantern, designed to not only shed light, but also to provide heat. It is ideal for situations like ours, where we need to walk a distance in the cold. It seems to be working very well, too. Unless any of you have an objection, let\u2019s be on our way.\u201dWith that, Madame Naoki, with a grand shove, pushes wide the doors of The Midnight Sun, and leads her group out into the cold, starry night. Their path is lit by the glow of her lantern, and the first stop is Lone Wolf Creations.", "link_list": ["http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/a/ac/Taric.move4.ogg/revision/latest?cb=20121127011112"], "image_list": [], "html": "Leaning forward once again, Naoki reaches down under the table, and disables the silencing rune.

He made sure to scour every spec of dirt from his scales then started work on baking up a fresh loaf of black bread for Alden, and in the process begin preparation for Moon's meal as well.Once the younger cook came back with the load of fresh ingredients (including some nice, crisp and chilled cabbage) the demon would start chopping and peeling up a storm. One of the advantages of having multiple prehensile limbs was that one could do a great deal of multitasking as was evidenced by Maelik's ability to get almost every portion of Alden's meal ready within minutes.Soon the demon chef would have the chicken plucked and gutted while the carrots and turnips were peeled and ready for their respective turns with the cabbage. He paid meticulous attention to the chicken as it roasted away on his hellfire rotisserie, twisting it slowly but taking care to not let too much juice sizzle off into the flames. He'd rub some butter into the cooking flesh as it turned, not too concerned about the heat of the flames and sprinkled on the occasional dash of ground lemon basil.While his hands were busy with the chicken his wings went to work in splitting the cabbage and his tail speared some solidified boar lard before setting it down on a nearby plate and shearing off a fine layered cut of it. The fat would then get flipped into a buttered pan where it would be brought to a melt. Afterwards the carrots would be gently scooped up and poured in for a quick fry in the butter and melted fat.Moon's dish was even more complicated than that, he didn't have a name for the dish he was gonna whip up for her just yet but he figured that in order to wow a new customer he'd try something new.Hers was a project in which he had to block out anyone else from helping, taking it off to the backroom where nobody else could view his secret techniques and odd preparation styles. Oddly enough he didn't take anything with him besides a single bowl of water but when he returned in but a few short (meaning within less than two minutes) he carried with him an entire loaf of spice bread, a blue boiled lobster, a plate of yellow peppers stuffed with jasmine rice and sweet beans. Also a single cinnamon roll.Apparently the roll was for himself though as he set that off to the side and ordered the rest of the food on plates in the most pleasing way possible before busting back out into the Sun.\"Voila!\" he exclaimed as he swooped in and placed the meal on the table before the two.\"Now, Moon dear I present to you for the first time ever, The Solar Flare! Originally it was meant to have Trinidad Moruga Scorpion peppers as a base with ghost peppers being added to make the lobster even spicier. However I opted to use the less Chocolate Habanero for the base and Rocoto as the secondary in the interest of not burning away any tastebuds. Don't let the blueness of the lobster fool you though, it's quite hot so be careful.

Moon was pondering the best way to share the information with him as she ate the last of her food, damn near licking her plate clean it was so delicious, but kept from acting like a complete and total animal. Barely. Sighing contentedly, she fished several coins out of an interior pocket of her vest, and placed them on the table. Probably way more than the food had cost, but she was in an exceedingly good mood. \"Well.. there is something I should probably tell you, since you're still my bodyguard, for the time being. Although.. I'm not so sure it's something that's easily told. It'd probably be easier to show you. But, I can't do it in here.\"She was being all mysterious!

Then.. demonstrate, I guess.\" Picking up her cloak, Moon scooted out of the booth and, with a small stretch, started toward the exit. Once Alden was caught up with her, she began to speak, still walking. \"I'm.. not from here. Not just the Free City, or Isra, but.. this whole continent. I've done a lot of wandering since I was just a kid, for.. reasons.\" Reasons that she obviously didn't want to go into, as she didn't elaborate. That was a story for another time.As they came outside, she moved a few steps away from the building, and stopped, handing him her cloak. \"If you would, hold that, please? So. Yes. I'm from a tribe. Well, two tribes, really. The Lhutomyn and the Fenriti. And they both had.. certain abilities.\" Was she going to say what, exactly, those abilities were? Nope. This was where the 'demonstration' part came in. As she stood there, looking at him, her features and body began to change. Her hair seemed to spread out, covering her body from head to toe, as her face began to change; her nose and mouth moved outward as the bones lengthened, forming into a muzzle, while her ears shifted upward and turned to furry points atop her head. Legs popped and shifted as the joints reversed, and lastly, her spine extended into a long, fluffy tail.In the end, a very large, white-furred wolf with Moon's intelligent silver-blue eyes sat on the street before Alden, gazing up at him.

Moon was pondering the best way to share the information with him as she ate the last of her food, damn near licking her plate clean it was so delicious, but kept from acting like a complete and total animal. Barely. Sighing contentedly, she fished several coins out of an interior pocket of her vest, and placed them on the table. Probably way more than the food had cost, but she was in an exceedingly good mood. <font color=\"7184A6\">\"Well.. there <i>is</i> something I should probably tell you, since you're still my bodyguard, for the time being. Although.. I'm not so sure it's something that's easily told. It'd probably be easier to show you. But, I can't do it in here.\"</font><br><br/>She was being all mysterious! That wasn't normally like Moon, and she seemed a little concerned, whether it was due to what she had to tell - or rather, show - him, or if she was simply worrying about what his reaction might be. <font color=\"7184A6\">\"Here, walk outside with me, and I'll explain. Then.. demonstrate, I guess.\"</font> Picking up her cloak, Moon scooted out of the booth and, with a small stretch, started toward the exit. Once Alden was caught up with her, she began to speak, still walking. <font color=\"7184A6\">\"I'm.. not from here. Not just the Free City, or Isra, but.. this whole continent. I've done a lot of wandering since I was just a kid, for.. reasons.\"</font> Reasons that she obviously didn't want to go into, as she didn't elaborate. That was a story for another time.<br/><br/>As they came outside, she moved a few steps away from the building, and stopped, handing him her cloak. <font color=\"7184A6\">\"If you would, hold that, please? So. Yes. I'm from a tribe. Well, two tribes, really. The Lhutomyn and the Fenriti. And they both had.. certain abilities.\"</font> Was she going to say what, exactly, those abilities were? Nope. This was where the 'demonstration' part came in. As she stood there, looking at him, her features and body began to change. Her hair seemed to spread out, covering her body from head to toe, as her face began to change; her nose and mouth moved outward as the bones lengthened, forming into a muzzle, while her ears shifted upward and turned to furry points atop her head. Legs popped and shifted as the joints reversed, and lastly, her spine extended into a long, fluffy tail.<br/><br/>In the end, a very large, white-furred wolf with Moon's intelligent silver-blue eyes sat on the street before Alden, gazing up at him.

There\u2019s being part of one\u2019s adoptive family, there\u2019s owing debts, answering to a leader, companionship, the romantic way in that two individuals might \u2018own\u2019 each other, and chaining people up in the basement for one purpose or another, but, giving as a gift? That\u2019s sort of slavery. Is that standard or customary for fairies, to be owned, in that way? She finds the notion of owning another, even one as small as this, to be rather repulsive. Why not keep the relationship as \u2018companion\u2019 or \u2018friend\u2019? What\u2019s the need to own the fellow?There probably isn\u2019t much to be gained in holding the thing against its will, anyway. Though, as stated, Naoki isn\u2019t very well versed in fairies, she can\u2019t imagine what having a fairy in a cage would do for her. Fairy dust? They use it as a drug over in Gaulidn. But that could also be acquired just by having the guy around, and collecting the excess consensually, she presumes. And Naoki has no need of fairy dust- as a drug at least; from what she has been lead to understand, it isn\u2019t even that excellent of a drug. Perhaps it has other applications. Hm. Perhaps Kate\u2019s choice in wording wasn\u2019t fully indicative of the situation. Perhaps the fairy hadn\u2019t chosen to accompany Kate, or had even been caught. Though Naoki couldn\u2019t quite picture Kate capturing and forcing another creature to bend to her will, she could certainly see Kate misunderstanding angry twinkling as twinkling of consent. Regardless, Naoki resolves, the little purple thing, if it is, indeed, sentient, won\u2019t be made to do what it wouldn\u2019t like to, as long as she has a say in the matter. Though it would certainly be welcome, if it chooses, by its own free will, to stay. The matter could be resolved once the spritely little thing lands, she supposes. Accepting the fine box, Naoki is careful not to get any of the wet ink on the bottom onto her hands. She glances first at the door, finds it suitably closed and locked, and then up to the fairy, presumably still whizzing about the room. Finding both to be in states she finds agreeable, she opens the box. Inside, she finds a dress. A white dress, and a rather pretty one, at that. After setting the box on its side atop a blank sheet of paper, she unceremoniously strips off the unremarkable clothing she had been wearing. Discarding her previous attire, she lifts the dress above her head, and drops it down onto herself. It seems to fit remarkably well, and with only a few shimmies and adjustments, the garment grips her figure in all the right ways. It obviously doesn\u2019t have accommodations for her tail, leading to a bump on her rump where the constrained appendage distends the fabric, but that can be fixed. For now, she holds her tail downwards, the rounded reddish brown tip peeking out under the edging of the dress.Looking down at the garment, she does a little twirl for the benefit of all observing parties, causing the hem to floof outward before settling back down. \u201cI like it, it fits well.

It's the feeling you get when you want the best for someone else and will do anything to see it done.

But I digress, she's most likely head over heels for the guy and if he's smart he'll be feeling much the same for her.\"Maelik felt a little ill at ease sharing his opinion of love, especially with the object of those feelings so close at hand, but he may as well explain how he saw it clearly.\"As for the second half of your inquiry well... That depends on how vivid these visions are and what they happen to be about. Sometimes dreams are just replays of memories so terrible that the mind represses them from consciousness. However on the flip side nightmarish sights can manifest due to deep seated emotional fears rather than actual events and the mind is simply trying to work them out.

He had really hoped to not have to describe his dream.\"Okay, I can tell you what it's about.\"He takes a deep breath.\"First you should know a little bit about my past. I was an assassin, part of a group called the set. Pride described us as criminals for hire. There were seven of us in total: Pride our leader, Envy his second in command, Greed a master thief, Lust an expert spy, Gluttony who did odd jobs, Sloth who was our healer, and me. I was Wrath, an assassin, and one man strike team. Those were all code names, except mine, I had no other name than Wrath. If I had a family, or a life before I was wrath I can't remember. My first memory is of blinding pain, literally, because in my next memory I was blind.\"Alden points at his eyes.\"If you look closely you can see the runes, Pride scribed. After my eyes healed my my training began.I was kept on an emotion suppressing drug, it left me with only one emotion, rage. I lived for nothing but the job, because I was incapable of doing anything else. When I was fourteen Pride scribed my body runes. It wasn't as bad as the eye runes but still excruciating. When I was recovering I met Sloth for the first time. Our base was in a remote mountain village, she wasn't technically a part of the team. She was just a skilled local healer. She was kind to me, she talked to me, she taught me what friend ship was, even though at the time I was incapable of understanding.\"Alden takes another deep breath, this next part was hard.\"The dreams starts and I am in Sloths recovery bed, she just patched me up. I had been particularly damaged on a mission, and she finally confronted Pride. She had suspicions for years, but never said anything, this time though she couldn't turn a blind eye. Pride realized that she would ruin all his plans, so in revenge he did the cruelest thing he could think of. He ordered me to kill her. I was the reason she could no longer keep silent, and he would show how stupid her concern was. I stabbed Sloth through the heart. I stabbed my friend through the heart.\"Alden takes a long shuddering breath.\"She says something to me, I can't hear it but my vision goes red. Pride is saying something ignoring me, he doesn't see it coming when I stab him the back. Envy is surprised she tries to get up, I lunge across the room and smash her head into the stone wall. She moans, I do it again over and over until there is nothing left. Lust, Greed, and Gluttony come in to see what is happening. I kill Lust with a thrown knife. Gluttony comes at me he is a strong man, I am stronger. I break his neck. Greed has run that's not good he needs to die.\"Alden's face as he speaks slowly contorts to a mask of rage.\"I walk into the village covered in blood, someone screams. It makes me angry, and they die. More screaming, more death. Men, women, children, infants. The people of the village are hearty, some fight, but I am Wrath. By the time the screaming stops Greed's trail is cold. It doesn't matter he is weak, he has to stop, he has to rest, he has to eat, I can do without all of those for long enough. I catch him, and for delaying my Wrath, I decide to make him beg for death. He does.\"Alden finishes his story, and slowly calms himself down.

There must so, so many things that he has to do- so many difficult decisions to make and responsibilities to attend to. I like having the opportunity to make my voice heard within the government, and look forward to building a strong economy because it will directly benefit the city at large, as well as all of my friends in it, but to manage the entire city? ... That\u2019s too much. I already have enough power and influence to get what I want done, and this appointment is a nice platform from which I can exert my influence on the state in person, but I don\u2019t want any more than what I have. You raise an excellent point about not getting caught up with too many responsibilities, and it\u2019s not something I plan on doing.\u201d\u201cAnd to be honest, I'm already faced with a daunting enough task as it stands. I\u2019m going to have to construct the department from the ground up, creating most of the systems and procedures myself. But I think that in doing so, it\u2019ll be an excellent opportunity to make sure it\u2019s all done correctly, the first time, for all future generations. I would much rather create something new and efficient, than try to salvage some dysfunctional and decrepit existing system.\u201d\u201cThat all doesn't start for a while yet, though. Before I can do very much at all to run the Treasury Department, I\u2019ll need individuals to compose it. I put out some listings a few days ago: \u2018Now Hiring, Finance Experts\u2019. Next week, I\u2019ll be meeting with the candidates that come to apply, and selecting the members of my new department. Until then, all I need to do is square things away around here, and make sure The Sun is prepared to operate with a lower level of involvement on my part. Which is going quite well, actually. Skarlet\u2026 you\u2019ve met Skarlet, haven\u2019t you?\u201dShe ponders for a moment, and cannot recall any such meeting.\u201cNo, I don\u2019t believe you have, at least not in my presence. Skarlet is our floor manager downstairs; she\u2019s very good at what she does. You\u2019ve probably seen her at least, in the bunny suit. Hard to miss, that one. But I brought her up was in the context of preparing The Sun to operate in my partial absence, and Skarlet is going to be a major part of that. I\u2019m delegating to her most of the low level administrative tasks, the simple sorts of things that don\u2019t require much knowledge beyond how to accomplish the task. Signing for deliveries, managing the shifts, paying salaries, that sort of thing. She seems to be pretty good at it, and I hope to allow her to succeed me as manager eventually, if she continues to show promise as an effective administrator.\u201dHere, Naoki drops her tone of casualness for one of decidedly more personal conversation, makes eye contact, and broaches a new topic. \u201cWhich leads very nicely into the next thing I\u2019d like to ramble at you about, if you\u2019ll endure my prattling for a while longer. As I just mentioned, my next week is essentially wide open. I have no outstanding appointments or obligations until next Tuesday, once I\u2019m finished with what I was working on just before you came in. I thought that we might go and do something special, you and I. I have something in mind, but before I go into it, what do you think? Do you have anything planned, or any objections to the concept before I go on?\"", "link_list": ["/user/669", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1193/hiring-finance-experts", "/user/257"], "image_list": [], "html": "\u201cWell, I don\u2019t quite rule the city\u2026\u201d "}, "post-23785": {"user": null, "user_num": null, "timestamp": "1455483104000", "message": "Viktor, deciding that Davous was taking thoroughly too long, decided to see Isra's... other debauched location.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Viktor, deciding that Davous was taking thoroughly too long, decided to see Isra's... other debauched location."}, "post-23878": {"user": "Kate Green", "user_num": 567, "timestamp": "1455537155000", "message": "Most of the thing Naoki explained went a little over Kate's head.

You\u2019re here because I\u2019ve invited you to join me there. I\u2019ve had a large house built, and I intend to share it with you two, as those who are close to me- and perhaps some others, later down the road. I invited Skarlet and her boyfriend Francesco to come, but it seems that they\u2019re otherwise indisposed at the moment, and unable to join us today. I\u2019m going to speak briefly about the trip  to make sure we\u2019re all on the same page before we depart. Pardon me.\u201dShe makes her way over to the right wall, where a map of the world is displayed. Clearly visible in the center, and labeled as such, is Isra. Off to the west, The Nokari Mountains rise as a series of upturned V shapes. Within the mountain range, an oblong, bluish blob marks a lake, one of a few scattered throughout the mountains. Just off to one side of that lake, a small house symbol, adorned with a pair of cat ears, has been drawn. Standing to the side, Naoki extends a finger to point to the house symbol, attempting to position herself in such a way that allows all occupants of the room to see. \u201cThis is our destination. There is a portal conduit in the works between here and there, but it isn\u2019t prepared for safe use yet. It\u2019ll probably be finished within a few days of our arrival, depending on how long it takes my technician to finish his work. Instead, we will take my carriage, along a route sort of like this\u2026\u201dNaoki traces a line across the map back to Isra, mostly following the snaking black patches of the established roads. \u201cI estimate the trip will take about five hours, the carriage is relatively fast.  Maelik, I appreciate your offer to fly us over, but must decline. There are\u2026 five of us now, who cannot fly the long distance, and luggage, in addition to the parts for the portal conduit- which are rather fragile. You\u2019d need to make several trips to get all of us, all of our luggage, and all of the portal gubbins over there, even if Ms. Lum\u2019valia assists you, and I\u2019m not going to suggest that you do that, in the biting cold. \u2026 That, and I\u2019m not much one for flying; it makes me uncomfortable. If the two of you who are able to fly would prefer to do so rather than riding with us in the carriage, you\u2019re welcome to, but I must caution you: there are powerful defenses in place around the grounds, extending about two kilometers in every direction around the building, and the area is camouflaged to appear all but invisible from above. While you may be able to find the place and break the defenses, you would most definitely be harmed in the process, and I would really rather you not, because then the defenses would be broken.The only safe way to approach is through the front gate, and with the gate\u2019s unique key, which will be riding with us in the carriage. If you\u2019re going to fly, I suggest that you wait a couple hours after the carriage leaves, and aim to rendezvous with us at the gate, or maintain pace flying above the carriage, and land to walk through the gate with us.\u201d\u201cOnce we arrive with the last of the equipment necessary to finish the portal conduit, it should be operational within a few days, at which point you\u2019ll be free to come and go as you see fit, though the linked portal here in The Sun. The conduit is designed to be, once it is fully operational, suited for many repeated uses without any ill effects. This is an invitation that extends not to just now, but also for the foreseeable future; stay as long as you\u2019d like, sleep where you want, come and go as you please, make yourself at home. Personally, I intend to pop back and forth quite a lot to keep things here at the Sun on track and fulfill my role as a member of the Isranian government. Operators on both ends have been instructed to allow you free passage. Just make sure to have one of those trained operators see you through the portal, when you use them. As I understand, the conduit is designed in such a way that if you don\u2019t know exactly what you\u2019re doing when you use it, it will intentionally transport you somewhere quite undesirable. Which would be, as you can well imagine, not ideal, to say the least.\u201dMoving back over to stand behind her desk, Naoki spreads a scroll out across the surface, and weighs the ends down with a pair of ink bottles to keep it from rolling back up. It is a technical diagram, a floor plan, that depicts the building, what the blueprint was based off. It is a large building, with multiple stories and wings. There are  nine primary diagrams on this piece of paper, one for each wing, for each floor, as well as an indeterminate number of secondary diagrams and stretching hallways that would seem to imply that the house does not conform to the the standard rules of how space works. Each room is labeled with its name, but not measurements or furniture. There are, presumably, more detailed plans for each section, but by memorizing this overview, one would be able to navigate throughout without too many problems, assuming they can properly understand the strange ways in which the hallways seem to connect in ways they shouldn\u2019t be able to.\u201cThis is a map of the place. It\u2019s quite large, as you can see. This diagram only includes the main building; there are a number of supporting outbuildings as well, including the carriage house, stables, and a bath house. As I recall, there are between forty and fifty-five bedrooms, depending on how you count rooms with multiple beds, bunkbeds, beds large enough to accommodate more than a single individual, rooms divided by curtains, and mattresses that aren\u2019t intended for sleeping upon, persay. Design accommodations, bolstered by judicious use of spatial magic, have been made in some areas to provide comfortable, heated arrangements for dragon-sized individuals.\u201dShe nods in Lum\u2019Valia\u2019s direction. \u201cAs you might expect, keeping such a palace clean and maintained requires a small staff. As such, I\u2019ve sent a number\u2026 twelve or fifteen or so, I\u2019m not exactly sure, of my employees up there to do just that, to be the housekeeping staff. If you find yourself looking for something, you should feel free to ask or page one of them before seeking me out. They should - hopefully - know where everything is, and be able to direct you to whatever you might be searching for. They\u2019ll also do their best to attend to whatever needs you might have, and at least five of them are capable of producing edible foodstuffs in a kitchen. Please treat them all respectfully, and keep in mind that they\u2019re mostly all mostly human, and might make mistakes. This map will come with us, and I would encourage you all to review it at your leisure and obtain a functional understanding of the layout.\u201dFinished with the map, Naoki removes the ink bottles, rolls it back up into a scroll, and tucks it in the top of a bag sitting to the side of the desk.\u201cI\u2019m sure that you\u2019re all perfectly polite and considerate guests, and won\u2019t intentionally do anything untoward, but keep in mind that not all of the furniture is rated to support the full weight of two individuals, and some bodily fluids leave an awful stain. There are silencing runes throughout, and all of the load bearing beams should be reinforced with protective magics, so you shouldn\u2019t need to worry much about making a lot of noise, or doing any serious damage, but be cautious if you intend to use magic yourself, or if you\u2019re near something obviously fragile.\u201d\u201cAdditionally, you\u2019re free to explore the house as much as you\u2019d like - with one exception. but I would always advise knocking before opening closed doors, as not to interrupt anyone, and always shutting the door if you wouldn\u2019t like to be interrupted. Please ensure that your excursions avoid the basement, it\u2019s kept locked for a reason. To facilitate communication and the task of my security personnel, I would also advise that you all keep your communicative gemstone or eyeball on your person for the duration of your stay. Alarms will be sounded if they detect an entity who isn\u2019t associated with one of our gems. I\u2019ll provide everyone who doesn\u2019t already have one with a gemstone right now.\u201dFrom a cabinet behind her, Naoki takes a wooden bowl, and sets it on the desk. It is filled with purple gemstones, each inlaid into a trinket of some sort. Rings, necklaces, bracelets, earrings- a massive variety of mountings. She gestures, suggesting that someone pick a trinket for Klur to wear. Glancing to her shoulder to consider @scoville, she begins to rummage around in the bowl herself, searching for something small enough to suit him.\u201cBeyond that\u2026 I don\u2019t believe that I have much more to say. I would like to attempt to organize group meals and activities, but that\u2019s all sort of up in the air until we come to a consensus, which we can do later.

This is big news, if it\u2019s true. Medan was always a big trade partner, and generally pretty friendly, as far as nations go. They were always a somewhat comforting thing to have down there to the south, Isra could take some small comfort in the fact that Medan meant them no ill, and would continue to sit down there and get razed by dragons quietly. But new regimes are bad news. Who knows who they are, what they think, or what they want?Naoki does a brief mental inventory of her combined forces and components in Medan. She comes up with nothing. Not a single informant or observational establishment anywhere in the whole country. She hadn\u2019t needed any! Medan kept in touch, and informed Isra about things, the monthly dragon attacks, mostly. By piecing together information retroactively, Reese had discovered that Lum'Valia  once played a role in  the recovery after one of their attacks, and a few of her employees once lived there, but Naoki finds herself without any active agents in the country.

That was his original plan, however. He ended up dropping his paw a hundred times on the locks, not capable of unlocking them. Before he ripped off the door to let whoever came in, Madame Naoki would've aided him in the small, difficult matter.And then a squeaking, mongrel noise was emitted and came up the stairs a strange, bat-like creature, no larger than a foot.Looking with wide eyes, Aithen witnessed the small gargoyle hobble over nearby him, soon turning his head to Madame Naoki, hissing loudly and spreading his wings. At this point in time, the second figure would've stumbled forward, muttering angrily as he smacked the thing on its head with the scroll, about to hand it up to Aithen before the gargoyle hissed at him. Muttering another, eventually barking out at the gargoyle, the goblin continued to smack it a couple more times before it hissed again and scurried down the stairs, a small nod to Aithen before wiping his nose with his forearm, bowing with a nod of his head towards Madame Naoki, his hat falling a bit on his head before continuing his grumble-talk down the stairs.Lifting the letter to his eyes, he soon handed it to Madame Naoki. \"It appears they have changed course, this asset is now within a place known as, 'The Shadow District'.\" He growled under his throat, standing tall as he asked another question. He knew it was Zash'Neck who wrote the letter, black ink hidden to actually be the disgusting orc's salivation, simply thick enough to use as writing.

They demanded my documents, to which I replied that I had none, and asked whereby I may procure these papers.

I often receive visions completely at random, especially when I come into physical contact with an item or individual. But I can also willingly seek them out with the use of traditional scrying tools, such as reflective surfaces, crystals, the tarot, and runestones. In an offensive capability, I have the gift of pyromancy, although that is by far the lesser of my talents.\"Pausing momentarily to recall the other questions and then ponder her answers, Takhana continued after a few heartbeats. \"Where I am now has become.. unsatisfactory. Most of my life has been spent as a performer and sideshow fortune teller, but this has.. ceased to have any luster. I wish to do something that's actually useful, perhaps to benefit others in a meaningful manner if at all possible, or simply something more worthwhile than circus tricks.

Madame Naoki nods, and begins to speak again. \u201cIt\u2019s not every day I am approached by an individual with such a substantial set of skills. I would be very willing to offer employment to once such as yourself, Ms. Takhana, but first, let me speak a bit about myself, and the things I do, so you both have an idea of what goes on here beyond simply restaurant business.\u201dFrom the pouch on her hip, Naoki pulls out a gemstone, a small spherical sapphire, and begins to fiddle with as she's speaking, as she tends to do. \u201cI am, as I stated, Madame Naoki, and I own this building we\u2019re sitting in, The Midnight Sun. On the ground floor, we serve what many consider to be the finest food and drink in Isra, and doing that is the central focus of business around here. However, we also engage in a number of other, more exciting activities, primarily geared toward the betterment of Isra and its inhabitants. Alden here, I\u2019ve employed him as an \u2018Operative\u2019. I have a good handful of highly skilled and talented individuals to undertake what you might call\u2026 odd jobs. For example, Alden recently was tasked with guarding a citizen to whom we owed a favor. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not implying that I run a crime empire on the side, or anything like that, but I have done what the government cannot, here in Isra and abroad. Unless either of you would prefer to work with food, as waitresses or cooks or what-have-you, I would be offering jobs as \u2018Operatives\u2019. I would provide you with food, lodgings, pay, and whatever else you need to operate effectively, and you would occasionally be tasked with doing jobs and completing tasks for me. I can\u2019t speak effectively to the sort of tasks, but I can say that you won\u2019t be asked to do anything that would be beyond your capabilities or anything that would endanger your life without your consent.\u201d\u201cHowever, for you, Ms. Takhana, I\u2019d like to offer something slightly different. You may noticed on your way up, the office across the hall. It probably positively glows with magic. That is the office of my esteemed associate, Mr. Reese Cresno  . He specialises in artifice and scrying magic, and functions as a sort of spymaster, if you will. In his office over there, he collects information from all across the world, and interprets it into data we can use. It sounds to me like your and his skillsets overlap in a way that seems to me that you\u2019d be able to accomplish a lot, working together. I would suggest that, after we\u2019re finished speaking here, or right now, if you\u2019d prefer, that you pop across the hall, and speak with him. He's already heard everything we've said, so there won't be a need to repeat yourself.\"\"How about you, Ms. Cynder?

Putting a hand to her chin, Naoki leans back and considers Cynder. These ones are always the hardest- the ones that don\u2019t know what they want to do. Cynder here could really fit into a number of positions, Naoki thinks; and it's her task to figure which one will be best suited.The easiest solution would be to send her over to The Moonlight Eclipse- she said she can dance, and definitely checks all of the \u2018alluring\u2019, \u2018exotic\u2019, and \u2018flexible\u2019 boxes. Some of the patrons over there have 'interesting' tastes, and if Naoki were a betting woman, she would bet highly on many of their high paying customers paying a bit more for \u2018supplementary services\u2019 from Cynder. The sapphire is seen from the left hand to the right, where Naoki proceeds to pop it into the air with a flick of her thumb, before catching it in the open palm of the same hand. But neither Cynder nor Alden would be in favor of that, she figures. It would keep them apart, and Alden may be as prone to jealousy as he is drawn to fur.\u00a0Most of the same things could be said about working in either establishment as a member of the wait staff. Seeing as how Cynder didn\u2019t mention any propensity toward the culinary arts, and probably wouldn't be suited to menial work, that essentially only leaves the more interesting things. After mulling the matter over for a short while longer, Naoki leans back up in her chair and begins to articulate her proposed solution. \u201cHow about this, then, Cynder. If you\u2019ll accept, I\u2019d like to offer you a position as an Operative. My Operatives tend to work in teams of at least two, and Alden here has been without a partner up until this point- at least in the professional regard. So if the two of you are willing to work together, I see no reason not to allow you to. I\u2019ll reiterate- sometimes the work I\u2019ll ask you to undertake will be dangerous, but you\u2019ll always have the option to decline a job. All the time that you find yourself with when not working on something for me will remain yours to do what with you will.\u201dFiguring that both Cynder and Takhana are only just visiting Isra for the first time, Naoki figures it best to give them the full primer. \u201cPay, for the both of you, will come bi-weekly; every other Friday, in Midnight Sun tokens.\u201dNaoki drops a small assortment of the mentioned coins on the desktop for display, they clink together metallically as they settle atop the paperwork.  The coins are within Takhana\u2019s reach, should she decide to examine them. \u201cThey are an internal currency we use to easily handle business here in The Sun, as well as over at The Moonlight Eclipse, our classier sister establishment. You may have noticed on your way in, the exchange counter. There, one can exchange the currencies of the world and any manner of valuable for tokens, and vice versa. Conversion is accepted in both directions. The tokens themselves are also accepted by most merchants here in Isra; it\u2019s a stable currency that will hold value as so long as we continue to provide the best service. If either of you have any objections to being paid in tokens, I\u2019m willing to negotiate.\u201d\u201cAdditionally, there\u2019s another major idea I should introduce you to, our communication network.\u201dLeaving the coins on the desk, Naoki turns about in her chair to take a bowl from the cabinet to her side, and places it on the desk between Takhana and Cynder. It is the same wooden bowl she has offered many new employees the opportunity to choose from, still piled high with all manner of jewelry, piercings, and trinkets, each with a slightly shimmering purple gemstone featured in some way. To Takhana, each gem might be seen to have a very complicated enchantment placed upon it- at least one, relating to the magic of the mind, and in a few cases, in combination with other assorted enchantments.\u201cAs opposed to using messengers, trained birds, or the postal service, we here at The Midnight Sun use a unique system of gemstone enabled telepathy to keep in touch. These magical artifacts enable the wearer to communicate telepathically with anyone else wearing one, over any distance, instantaneously and silently. The network is, as far as I\u2019m aware, unique across all the world; Mr. Cresno developed it himself. There\u2019s obviously more to it than what I\u2019ve summarized just now, but you\u2019ll need to speak to him about it. He tends to spend a short while training new users on how to properly utilise their new ability. But let it suffice for me to say, you\u2019ll both need to choose one of these items and keep it on your person at all times, or ask Mr. Cresno to create you something personal.

She retains the second pile, and levies at question at Takhana. \u201cMs. Takhana, with your unique form of sight, I imagine it may be difficult for you to write, or fill out documents in the regular way. Would you prefer that I assist you by asking you for information verbally, and filling out the form myself, or would it perhaps be possible for me to draft you a new set of paperwork- utilizing a magical manner of ink?
