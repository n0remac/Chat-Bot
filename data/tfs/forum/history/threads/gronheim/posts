Sometimes they would be successful in this endeavour, other times they would never find the culprit responsible no matter how much tracking experience they had.\u00a0This began to change when in the space of two days, three people turned up dead in the nearby woods. When the news reached the elders of Gronheim, they initially tried to keep it a secret to avoid the spread of panic but it wasn't long until a family member of the deceased let out that there were growing dangers hidden in the trees around them and came forth publicly to demand answers. Suddenly and in the space of but a few hours, the humans and wood-elves of Gronheim, or \"green home\", all but stopped venturing beyond their palisade walls to pick berries and look for game.\u00a0Yet the attacks didn't stop. They didn't go away. Their warriors still had to go out and get food, the guards still had to go out on patrol along the roads and merchants still had to pass through the area to reach the edge of the forest; yet more and more often, sometimes up to several times a day, the attacks from wild beasts continued and grew in ferocity. First wolves, then bears, then direwolves and direbears! As the days passed into the second week, even more dangerous and frightening creatures came out of the depths of the woods to harass them including spriggans and spiders the size of large dogs. By this time civilians were warned not to leave the palisade walls, the guard duty doubled at night and as several of their warriors began to fall, patrols were cut back and the roads left more and more unguarded... Which left merchants at the mercy of those creatures who coveted shiny treasure to hide in their holes.\u00a0The wisemen and wizards gathered to discuss the matter, where they decided that something nefarious was driving dangerous animals and monsters towards their home in an act of hostility against them. Other than this they could not say; who was behind it? What were they gaining out of it? Why them? How did they stop it? All questions to which they had no answers and so they called upon the greatest of them to investigate, a party of six would-be heroes who would venture out into the forest together and follow the beasts back to their source.A week later, the party was missing and not a single word was sent back to Gronheim to explain it. Even worse, attacks had grown in the days after they left to such an extent that leaving the gates of Gronheim open became too dangerous and not even guards ventured outside the safety of their walls. It was, in effect, a siege that left them truly isolated from the rest of the world.Yet one hope remained for them. They wrote out a call for aid on flyers and notices and after giving them instructions on where to go, they released their entire flock of carrier-birds into the sky to go far and wide to deliver them. With nothing left but to hope that reinforcements would arrive on time, Gronheim prepared to hold their walls no matter the cost.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "It was over the course of several days that attacks from fearsome animals in the forest began to increase on the hunters sent out to gather food and guards sent out to patrol the road.

He was used to traveling by now, having traveled all over the world. Being the family wild child of house Bowmour, he was always destined for a life of adventure. Although he enjoyed his time adventuring he very much hoped he could return to his family some day to present his achievements in his time being absent from the Bowmour keep. He hoped he could gain somewhat of a reputation for himself before returning, he couldn't just return with some rabbit pelts and a wolf which he'd managed to find and tame. He couldn't possibly decline this offer to help out a town in need. He had a way with beasts, he knew how they thought and acted like no other man. He'd call himself an expert, though he knew he was far from it. He was better than the average man, though the young boy still had a lot to learn.He pulled the parchment from his pocket which stated the details of the recent attacks, and briefly read through it as he traveled down the long and deserted road which lead to Gronheim. Horse tracks were still visible in the ground which he walked due to the merchants which had quickly fled the town fairly recently in hopes of escaping the recent mishaps. Some weren't so lucky, and Elijah knew this due to the overturned and horseless cart which was left on the side of the road. There was blood, but no person. He could only let his imagination wander to know what might have happened to the poor soul which lead the cart out of town. They were clearly not along judging by the amount of blood, as well as the various fighting equipment which was scattered not far from the cart. He found himself a small amount of gold to keep himself going for a while. He figured nobody would have looted it due to the rush to escape the town.The town of Gronheim was just about in sight in the distance now. He was heading down the only road which lead into the town. He'd heard of the dangerous beasts which marked their territory in the nearby forests, and decided the road would be the best option. His trusty Dire Wolf companion would be able to sniff out any foes long before they'd come too close, to give Elijah the upper hand with time to prepare himself. Although, so far the roads seemed bare, not a person or beast in sight. The beasts were probably focusing their efforts on the town, their main supply of food was after all awaiting them on a silver plate, should Gronheim not be able to defend from the recent attacks.As Elijah got closer to the town, his Wolf seemed on edge. He noticed and stopped to take in his surroundings. He heard the whistling, possibly of a man in the distance of the forest. He places his spear on the ground next to a tree as he climbed it to get a better view. Mostly, he could just see other trees, nothing much. \"Hunter.\" He called out for his companion. \"Scout.\"\u00a0He said in an enthusiastic tone as the relatively youthful Dire Wolf pounced off deeper into the woods. Elijah made his way down from the top of the tree. He thought he saw some movement in the distance but he wasn't really too sure. He snatched his spear from the ground and chased after his wolf. Hunter had lead him into a slight opening in which two were having a conversation. Hunter remained alert, though he had not been commanded to attack so he would not show any signs of aggression. Eventually Elijah caught up to his companion and slowly came to a halt next to the wolf.He'd be panting a little due to his short, yet distant run. He first noticed the dwarf, standing tall, or as tall as he could with his large hammer. And then there was also the woman, her antlers making her stick out quite a bit from the rest of the random travelers which Elijah had often ran into. \"I hope I wasn't interrupting anything.\"\u00a0He said, petting his wolf on the head as it sat down beside him with his left hand, while resting his spear on the ground in his right hand.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "(If you don't want to read this needlessly long post just skip to the last 2/3 paragraphs, the first few aren't too important)"}, "post-43864": {"user": "Tolgar Cotterill", "user_num": 1659, "timestamp": "1468253730000", "message": "((Just read the last paragraph if you wanna skip this))Tolgar made his way through the thick foliage, his halberd being used as a makeshift walking stick as he navigated the uneven and occasionally waterlogged ground. He stopped by a huge, moss covered tree and rested the halberd against it. The town shouldn't be too far by now, had he followed the footpaths and landmarks correctly it should be another 20 minutes walk. Toglar scratched his scraggly beard and and surveyed the land around him. Nothing but trees as far as the eye could see, and these forests were mainly devoid of civilisation so there was little hope of a random traveller passing by and giving directions. Unravelling a leather cord, Tolgar pulled out several parchment documents, all crumpled and stained with travel. At the top of the pile was the pamphlet that had been passed around, detailing the troubles and woes of this village. It didn't seem too high risk, supernatural suspicion always arose when people started to fear what they couldn't see. the problem is likely just an increase in wolf packs or some other natural occurrence. Of course, there was always the chance of their nightmares being true. Skimming the last few lines of the document, Tolgar pushed any doubts to the back of his mind and replaced them with the thoughts of new contacts and an appropriate reward.The second parchment was a crudely drawn map accompanied by a short description beneath it, purchased from a cheap scout who'd recently surveyed the area. Following these directions and tips he'd gotten this far and it seemed this was the right direction. The description mentions a small stream that runs directly towards the town, and from this map he must be close.Tolgar heightened his senses, glaring throughout the forest, searching for any slight shimmer amongst the green and brown. It took only a brief moment for him to spot it, a mere 100 ft away. The stream was small, and headed downhill at a slight angle. This must be it. Tolgar tucked away his papers, grabbed his halberd and made his way to the stream. It was roughly 10 ft across and only a couple feet deep, easily crossed if needed. This was the first time he'd had a proper glimpse of his reflection in a long time. His facial hair was bushier than ever, greyer than ever, and his head had balded even more. Tolgar stared for a moment. The reflection served as a reminder, he wasn't the man he once was, and sooner or later he'd have to pack it all in.A branch snap stole Tolgar's attention and he found himself gripping his halberd and pivoting on the spot. His eyes scanned left and right, nothing. An animal has the advantage of natural camouflage, but a human's eyesight is usually enough to spot it, and he could see nothing. He waited a few moments before relaxing his composure, whatever it was, it wasn't big enough to kill him in one fell swoop.Tolgar turned his attention back to the flow of the river, but kept his wits about him. Underestimating his enemy was not something Tolgar would allow himself to do, but if he couldn't see his enemy, he couldn't fight it. Besides, the journey was long, and his feet hurt.It didn't take long to reach the town. Once past the trees, the tall, palisade wall was easily seen. Tolgar made his way around the wall, to the gate. He'd made the conscious decision not to use the road, figured if there was some merit to the malicious nature of these animal attacks, the roads would be where the forces were focused.

Yes, that's it, just a bunch of racists. Elijah grew a quick liking of the dwarf, first impressions were everything to the young lad. Although it was probably just because the lad thought he looked 'cool'. He liked his armour, the dwarfs were known to be expert blacksmiths.Elijah wondered what the daughter of a king was doing wandering the woods, especially near a small settlement such as Gronheim. Judging by the antlers which sat neatly atop her head, he was probably some form of nature 'king'. Elijah might look like a tree hugger, though he was certainly far from it. He was wild, but more so like that of a Wolf, than someone who dedicates their life to protecting nature. He hoped his purpose would be more than just watching leaves fall from branches. Though who was he to judge, for all he knew her father could be a king with a castle which towered above the common people, though it made much more sense to him that they were some form of worshipers of nature.\"They won't kill me.\" He said with a cocky grin and a pat to his wolf's head in response to the antlered queen's comment.

The guard's shouting was of utmost urgency, they couldn't fight this attack off and were obviously retreating. This was probably the most inopportune time to arrive. He considered himself a skilled warrior, but not so skilled as to single handedly wipe out a group of this stature. His eyes swiped left and right, the guard's shield wall was buckling and being forced back at an alarming rate. Tolgar had to act fast or be stuck outside. At that point the only way he'd survive is to run or... well, he wasn't prepared to go down that route.The high pitched screeching he now determined to be from Goblins fighting amongst the ranks, Tolgar spent a moment of confusion frowning. If goblins were fighting alongside the attackers, there certainly was more to this than he had hoped. There, Tolgar's gaze turned to stare intently at a small opening in the rank of beasts and goblins. It wasn't entirely open to pass through, but certainly easier than any other entry. Tolgar would still have to fight his way through a goblin stabbing from the back and a bear currently smashing its mighty claws against the receding shield wall, not to mention he'd be open to attacks from both sides from the other creatures, all as ferocious and frenzied as the next. He was concealed as of right now, none of the beasts had seemed to notice him. This was something that would give him an opportunity, one that he'd have to take up. Tolgar darted forward from the bushes, halberd dragging behind him and held in both hands. Five feet from the first goblin, he sent his boot into the dirt and, using the continued momentum, swung the halberd in a massive 180 degree arc above his head. The axe-like head came crashing down, slicing through the goblin's collar bone with almost no resistance. Dark blood spurted out from the wound, and covered both the halberd and the goblin's head in the thick blood. It went into spasm, screeching out in pain and dropping squirming to escape the bite of the halberd. Tolgar ripped it backwards, causing even more damage and bringing the goblin hurtling to the floor.He had no time to waste, his presence was known now and needed to move quickly. A few steps forward and he was amongst the beasts. The halberd was useless now, with no room to swing it'd be pointless to try. Tolgar drew the hand-axe with his left hand and rushed forwards, towards a scar-covered bear, standing on its hind legs as it battled with the shield wall. There was no time to kill the damn thing, and so he swung the axe against the matted fur on its lower left leg, right behind the knee. Toglar continued moving, the blow should be enough to stun the beast and possibly force it to pull back. The bear roared out as it dropped down onto its left knee, and then down to all fours. He was now met with the shield wall, and they clearly hadn't seen him coming from behind the mighty stature of the bear. The leftmost guard had instinctively tried to swing at him before making eye contact. Tolgar felt a huge smash against his back, sending him crashing against the shield-wall. \"Let me through, you fucking twats!\" Tolgar yelled as he was forced against the shields. Almost instantly, the wall opened up, and he stumbled through, clutching his halberd in one hand and his axe in the other. Once through, the wall began to backpedal at an alarmingly fast rate. Tolgar sheathed the axe into its ring, and held the halberd above his head in a spear-like fashion. Not the intended use for a halberd, with the unbalanced weight, but behind the protection of a shield wall it'd work. The bear Tolgar had previously struck was now back on its two legs. Clearly, the strike wasn't enough to sever the muscles. Spotting Tolgar, the beast let our a loud roar, and charged forth, smashing itself against the interlocking shields and pushing the men back. Tolgar had simply pissed it off even further. The interlocking shields were struggling to hold the beast at bay, and the guardsmen had begun to weaken.

The pulse sent many of the smaller beasts, such as goblins and wolves, crushing down to the ground, their feeble muscle mass unable to withstand the mighty effect of the magic. He quickly turned his head back to the wall, scanning those who manned it. An assortment of soldiers, but amongst whom a woman was distinctively different. Her attire was colourful and ornate, an odd choice for battle-wear but Tolgar questioned it not, magic and those who mastered its use was not his forte. Before he could even properly regain his stature, a shining warrior leaped from the walls, slashing at a wolf and any else who opposed her. Her armour was of exquisite craftsmanship, she must have paid a pretty penny for it. Admirable, she was of competent skill as to not get herself skilled during such a feat. However, it was a stupid decision. She was now in front of the shield-wall, the exact opposite of where she needed to be.\"You!\" Tolgar yelled out, maintaining an intense stare on the warrior to get her attention. \"Get over here, we need to close the gate, there's too many!\" A goblin continued to slash at a shield, in an attempt to break through or break the shield itself he did not know. Regardless, it was to little effect. Tolgar plunged the spear-tipped halberd between the lines, plunging it deep inside the chest of the distracted goblin. Letting out a high pitched shriek, the creature collapsed under a fountain of its own blood, spraying both itself and the shields in front.He turned his attention back beyond the shield wall, to the woman. The beasts that surrounded her would surely begin to notice the easy prey and try to surround her, she had to act fast or be enveloped by the claws and screams of these creatures. The wall wasn't composed of highly trained knights, but of normal guardsmen who's lives were probably flashing before their eyes at this very moment. Morale was one of the biggest factors in the outcome of a battle, and if one man's morale broke, so would the wall.\"Guardsmen, close ranks! Don't give them an opening!\" he yelled, pacing up and down the line. They needed to hold them for only the time it took for this woman to get back behind the wall, of that he was certain they could achieve.A bear on hind legs, different from the last, slammed itself against the men, leaning forth. Tolgar give the beast his full attention, something was odd in the way the bear stood, as if uncomfortable. A body, green in colour, scrambled from atop its shoulder and leaped over over the wall, landing by Tolgar's side. The creature, using its small size and mobility, hastily rolled back to its feet and started to drive its spear into Tolgar's leg. There was no time to react, and the crudely crafted spear found its mark in his thigh. \"Agh!\" He balled his right hand into a fist and smashed it across the goblin's head in a strong left-to-right motion. The goblin reared back, yanking the spear out of his leg and bringing a huge spurt of red blood with it. The pain was excruciating, and sent Tolgar falling down to his other knee. He clutched it tightly, clenching his teeth and scrunching his face. No, he had no time, a goblin was no formidable foe, he could defeat it even with this injury.It was far too fast and far too small to combat effectively with a halberd, but dual wielding his short-sword and axe would work well. Tolgar forced himself to his feet, unsheathing his new weapon set and facing the tiny goblin. Yes, an easy kill. He took a step forward, making his best efforts to ignore the pain and swung his sword sword to the left. The goblin, as predicted, blocked the attack with the shaft of his spear. Toglar brought his axe around, hooking the polearm and yanking it from the goblin's possession with considerably superior strength. The goblin, with a confused and petrified look upon its face, had the sharp blade of Tolgar's short-sword driven through its neck. Usually, he'd grant a mercy kill as an opponent falls. But this time, his eyes were filled with hatred. He would show no compassion for a goblin that had actually managed to injure him.

As soon as the gates were shut, he'd have to bandage it and seek further help.Thankfully, the guardsmen's synchronised shield bash had given him ample time to simply turn and flee without so much as looking back. There wasn't an immediate danger, especially with the guards finishing off any beasts that had lost their footing. Trouble was, he didn't need to see the oncoming onslaught, he could hear it. The ground trembled and the air was filled with the growls, shrieks and roars of the next wave. The wooden palisade walls were strong, and tall. They should hold, but if this beast army decided to lay siege to the town, keep it constantly surrounded, there was little they could do.Tolgar shook the thoughts from his head, and turned to give any possible aid he could to the guardsmen running inside. Each man had a different wound, but all had at least one, and all were exhausted. Sweat dripped from below their helmets and arming caps, a testament to their great efforts in holding the wall. Tolgar inspected each man carefully, studied their faces, their walk and their voices. He held a great deal of respect for guardsmen, the folk who had their lives on the line almost every day to protect their town, and often with no recognition. They were not rewarded with huge castles, great sums of money or an appealing wife. Instead, they were merely catered for, kept alive and well so they could protect their homes in the next day. These were the men he'd seek out tonight, drink with them and relish in each-other's tales of bravery and bravado.He turned his head back to the gate as it came crashing down, just in time to witness the knightly woman rushing back inside. Her armour was now stained with the blood of her fallen foes, as was her sword.Tolgar fell to his uninjured knee, a hand still cupping the wound tightly with blood seeping between his fingers. At worst, he'd get an infection and potentially lose his leg, or his life. He scoffed at the thought, he'll be fine, he's had worse. He looked atop the wall, searching primarily for the sorcerer, and she wasn't hard to spot as she non-nonchalantly dropped down. Perhaps she knew some sort of restoration magic? No, he'd not ask. He only ever used magic as a last resort, including the kind that cursed him.Overhearing their conversation, Tolgar agreed. But first, his wound. He opened a small, muddy pouch on his belt and retrieved a generally clean bandage.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Tolgar had no illusions of grandeur, as soon as the order was given, he turned tail and hurried through the gate with a very noticeable limp and blood trickling from his thigh wound.

Every hurt person would eventually receive attention, no matter whether from Gronheim or other lands around it.A dog-sized cat hopped down from one of the thick branches and hit the top of the small wall with a silent thus that left muddy prints on the stonework; he sat down, raised a paw and began to lick it clean while guardsmen gathered around to catch their breath. Fresh warriors had gone now to the gate to watch for any attempt to assault it, but with the keen archers still atop the walls they had little chance of getting anything with the power to break it down close enough to be considered a danger.\u00a0\"Well done everyone,\" spoke an elderly elven male who approached the gathering place with two other ealdormen flanking him like wings.

He had been hoping for more, yet there was no advantage in looking a gift horse in the mouth and he knew that he would simply have to plan with extra caution from now on.\"I know many of you will want to rest and eat, but before that I am open to any questions you might have.
