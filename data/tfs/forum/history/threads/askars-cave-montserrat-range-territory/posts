Range in the South-West corner of Rond\u00f3n Territory there lies a cave. The mouth of the cave is two-thousand feet wide, and roughly a thousand feet tall. It goes below the mountains, far into the deep. Down in the cave there is a cold so fierce that one could only hope to make it through a nights sleep unless a suitable fire was started. If one could even start fires down there. There was ice running along the walls, ice on the floor and on the ceiling. Everything was cold, wet and slippery. In the heart of the mountains, one would find a room so vast that one might think it the ruins of a dwarven city. This was merely where the dragon slept. Tunnels and passageways run into the earths crust, pitch black darkness swallowing courage from any fool that would be brave enough to venture this far into the ground.\u00a0A journey through this cave could take days and that was if one could find the way. But tales of great riches had always been told when it came to the caverns of dragons, perhaps this was enough to lure a desperate soul or two into the mountains? Only time would tell.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/Lh9QSs3.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Lh9QSs3.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}}
