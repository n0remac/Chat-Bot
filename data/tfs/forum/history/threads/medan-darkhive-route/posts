Roy for short. I went there because the guy said it would be safe for someone like me, but it isn't. There's too many other vampires, and they wouldn't hesitate to eat me alive. I got tired of hiding in my room all the time, so I decided to leave. But the road is long and dangerous, which is why I'm traveling with you guys. If I can find my way back to Medan, I'll be good. So, how about you? Who are you people, and why were you trying to sail the dark coast? That's a bit silly, if you don't mind my saying. Er...say, would you like some chocolate?

He had shown a rather knowledgeable intellect since the group first met.  \"I see.... soldiers.  From Medan.  Yes, that there is the insignia of the Kingdom of Medan.\"\"Soldiers?\"  Vald rubbed his chin, the bristling of his beard audible to those nearby.  \"That means they have weapons.  Come, let us go and meet them.\"  Vald and the other seven Varan continued down the road normally, and Vald looked back and said \"Roy, mate, if it is blood you need, then drink it from their corpses!\"A few minutes passed and the Varan convoy met up with the Medan caravan.  It was a simple horse-drawn carriage with about six soldiers acting as escort, as well as one carriage driver - also armed. \"Ahoy, mates,\" called out Vald.The guards looked somewhat nervous and gripped the hilts of their weapons.  \"Easy lads,\" a Medan guardsman spoke to his men, then looking at Vald continued \"what is your business here?  And who are you?\"One of the other guards' eyes sparked up and he approached a few steps.  By then the Varan under Vald's control had formed a semi-circle around the convoy.  \"Wait,\" the guard spoke, \"I know these fellows.  They're Varan!  Yeah... you know, sir, ex-raiders who seek employment?  Why not hire them?  They can help us transport-\"\"Hold your tongue,\" the lead guardsman replied harshly.\"Sorry,\" Vald said bluntly, his arms outstretched as he slowly approached the lead guard.  \"But we're not seeking employment... anymore.\"As if pre-meditated, all eight Varan swarmed on the men, slamming their fists into their faces and guts and brutally beating them down before they had a chance to draw their weapons.  When they were down, some of the Varan knelt down and twisted their necks enough to snap them.\"Well, that's taken care of,\" Baeron said.Vald picked up a sword and swung it a few times to feel it out.  Baeron found the heaviest sword, which had been placed on the side of the side of the carriage.  Varri picked up and pulled on a bow a few times.  Hakon, and the others, picked up the other swords which had been stored on the carriage.  Ranavald found him a nice set of daggers which to use.Ranavald then noticed a sudden shift in the carriage before its door flung open - and there stood a woman who squaled at the sight of her dead guards.  \"Oh, lookie here boys,\" he hissed, \"we got ourselves a pretty little one, aye?\"\"Leave her be,\" command Vald, putting his sword in front of Ranavald's face so as to block him from reaching the woman.The women took off running and Varri strung his bow and aimed her way as she was still yelling.  Varri looked over at Vald, who nodded, and then Varri released the bowstring and sent an arrow flying that struck and penetrated the back of her head.\"Good,\" Vald replied, nodding, \"let us be on our way.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"Ahaha,\" Vald laughs, \"vampires, werewolves, demons, it's all the same to us.
