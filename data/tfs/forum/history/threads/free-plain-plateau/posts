His left arm would extend towards Wolgang and his fire. The moment the fire ignited, Zaltos would take control of the fire. This would ease the draw on Wolfgang's magic.The fire would roar, rushing to Zaltos's form. The fire would keep it's power as it moved, disappearing into Zaltos's palm. He was preparing to unleash a powerful attack by converting and multiplying the fire power within him.In the blink of an eye, Zaltos shot towards the closest enemy. Behind him was a trail of fire, drying out the plain and spreading. When Zaltos hit the tree line, he bolted through it, the fire roaring like a dragon as he moved.It took maybe one minute, and the fires Zaltos had left behind were roaring, consuming the land. Zaltos returned to his original point, taking control of the wildfire. Zaltos would draw in most of the powerful flames, leaving only a wall down the treeline. Even if an archer had been missed, the wall of fire would have consumed them.Zaltos walked over to Wolfgang and Raven. His form was still hazy due to the heat from the speed and fire. The smoke and ash from the still raging fire wouldn't help any either.When Zaltos was standing next to the two, he would speak, \"Are you two ready to go through the fire?\"Then a roar ripped through the air. Two strong magical presences were felt. Whatever it was, one could bet it is what was summoned by the elves.\"We need to move. Your men are on the other side and something has been summoned. There shouldn't be much trouble directly behind the fire, so when we break through, i'm hunting down the first summoner. Wolfgang, find your men and regroup. When you regroup, send me a message just like when we encountered each other earlier. I'll cover you until your out of sight.\"  Zaltos spoke.Zaltos then removed his shield, handing it to Wolfgang, \"It might be a bit heavy, but it is highly magic resistant and can withstand a dragons bite. Use it when you find the other summoner.\" Zaltos then took notice to the gem, \"Raven, for everyone's sake, do not let them get ahold of that gem. If they do, this hold battle could change drastically.\"Zaltos was ready to guide the two through the wall of fire. He knew they had to be quick, because he knew the first summoner and creature were on the other side. The babattle was truely about to begin, the trio was truely unaware of what was waiting for them on the other side of the fire.", "link_list": ["/post/1676/thread", "/user/5"], "image_list": ["//storage.proboards.com/6046952/avatar/Lk5wpMK9vcEVvTFxF5JR.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@wolfgangvondanzig\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/1676/thread\" timestamp=\"1429978645\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-5\" title=\"Wolfgang Von Danzig\"><img alt=\"Wolfgang Von Danzig Avatar\" src=\"//storage.proboards.com/6046952/avatar/Lk5wpMK9vcEVvTFxF5JR.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/1676/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1429978645000\" title=\"Apr 25, 2015 8:17:25 GMT -8\">Apr 25, 2015 8:17:25 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-5 group-0\" href=\"/user/5\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@wolfgangvondanzig\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Wolfgang Von Danzig</span></a></span> said:</div>(Sorry for my long absence.

Zaltos decided he was going to flank the elves on the plataeu, moving quickly to make up time.Zaltos wouldn't reach half way before he noticed the darkness was growing darker and darker. Grunts and snarls could be heard, but it was near impossible to see at this point. A trap had been set by the elves to prevent flanking and possibly attacking the Greydan from behind. From behind Zaltos came a loud roar. As Zaltos turned, he was caught by a massive stone club. The surprise and power sent Zaltos barreling through trees and bushes. If it could be seen, a one hundred foot stretch of destruction could be seen from Zaltos's path.He was very dazed. He couldn't feel his body. The sounds still echoed. Zaltos could feel whatever struck him moving closer, but he couldn't move. Whatever it was, it was massive and powerful.Then a set of voices could be heard coming from a bush,the first being a young boys, \"Oh no... we have to help him or they'll kill all of us!\" Next was a girls, \"What do we do? We're just kids...no magic or water..\"Another girl spoke, \"Poke him!\"The boy responded, \"That thing will eat us if it sees us.\"At this point, Zaltos was understanding more why the two breeds of elves were working together. At this point though, Zaltos knew if he couldn't get it together, the children would be found and killed. Just that fact alone, Zaltos's body began to move. His feeling was coming back. The stone club had smashed his ribs. The pain surged through his body as a cough erupted, sending blood out. Regardless, he knew he had to stand or him and the children would be hurt.With excruciating pain, Zaltos rose to his feet. The creature was now close enough that he could see, and it was a giant troll, about eighteen feet in heigth. The club was half it's size. The troll's armor was scarce, but it's body was clothed in firerat linens.Zaltos let out a whisper to the children, \"Run! i will protect you.\"Three children and a pup took off. Ten seconds later, the troll was bringing it's club downwards on Zaltos with all it's weight. Zaltos let off a yell from pain from his ribs and insides as he caught the club above his head. The force shoved Zaltos's feet four inches into the soil. Zaltos was trying to push or maneuver the club with all his might while the troll was pushing down with all it's might.__________________________________________Where Wolfgang and his men were was rather peaceful despite the fire and the yell.

His pain was enough to bring any normal being to the ground. He was relying on his will to live, muscle, and a spine. With this pain, Zaltos felt something inside him at work.The magical feeling inside began to show it's effects on Zaltos. Inside the mind of Zaltos, he was no longer imaging the woods and plataeu, but a field of golden fire and white clouds with a red sky. From the midst of these fires, a being took form, The being was garbed in armor fit for God. The being was twice the size of Zaltos, hiding half its body in a cloud.\"Take my hand and I will take away your pain...\", it spoke to Zaltos in a deep and powerful tone.The visor covering the beings face would slowly raise. Whatever Zaltos had seen pissed him off. His strength came in a powerful wave and he snapped back to reality. His eyes turned to fire, but still kept an eye shape. Zaltos would shove the club to his left. Immediately he stepped sideways and quickly pivoted his ribless body to bring a mighty right hook towards the trolls hand. When the club hit the ground, Zaltos's hand slammed into the top of the trolls hand. The troll would scream as Zaltos's fist literally flattened it's hand and shattered the clubs handle. Immediately the troll would grab it's pain and take a leap back. What the troll would soon experience would be much more excruciating than it's hand. Zaltos lept at the troll, his hands heading for it's head. When the troll noticed, it was too late. Zaltos was digging his fingers into the side of the trolls head while his thumbs jabbed into the eyes. His feet met the creatures chest, knocking it onto the ground.The trolls screams grew louder as Zaltos dug into it's head. The troll would try to grab Zaltos with it's good hand, but it was short lived as Zaltos was smashing it's shoulder with his foot. Snapping, ripping, and popping was occuring. The screams were mixing with gurgling as the trolls head was slowly being ripped off, pulling the spine out with it. The torture was two minutes. Zaltos was covered in blood as was the ground. Zaltos dropped the spine and head and knelt on the chest of the troll. He placed his hands on it and began to engulf it in a blue celestial flame. For the time being, Zaltos would draw the energy from the body of the troll to heal himself. __________________\"It's going to kill him!\", the children chimed over and over. \"That thing was going to eat us! The evil elves have captured our tribe and are going to kill them if the Chieftain doesn't tell them where the scrolls are! Please help!\" The boy spoke to the soldiers protecting them.The children were dressed in native American attire. They were young night elves. Their skin was a light purple and all had natural mohawks. Nobody would know, but the youngest girl was wearing an ancient necklace that dated to the near creation of life in the Free Plains. It was old and legend is that it is a key to the heavens(space). It was what the Dark Elves were after, but with this girl being a runaway, they had not yet found it.

Raven would find no resistance to her claim to the beast's hide; the men were primarily fixated on Zaltos' survival of the encounter and assessing his state of damage, and the children's pleas for help.\"Zaltos,\" he said as his companion in this battle recovered from the daze of his fight, \"we've come here to explore and find trade.

Jarkoopi's energy was showing, but it wasn't what he was sensing. There was something much more powerful lurking beneath the shadows..a dragon that made Zaltos shiver almost. His head would turn in the direction of the beasts.\"Wolfgang, let's finish clearing this plateau. Raven is right, we will have a very slim chance of helping anyone in time. If we clear this land, we can set up base at the top of the plateau and find us some help. If i'm feeling what I think it is, we may have more help than we need..\" Zaltos spoke.\"As for villages, if we reach the top i can search easier because of less natural interference. I don't think anyone is left, what has survived has retreated, so they'll be waiting. If you don't mind, I'm going to go track down the second dragon in the fields. If we can get one dragon, i will have enough power to garb your warriors with armor unlike any you have seen before. We could take on anything these elves could throw at us. So have your men keep patrol down here in two groups. You, Raven, me, and the children will go to the top.\" Zaltos spoke to the group.Everything was peaceful for now. The men would find gold and silver coins, as well as pieces of light armor and weapons. Mainly it was daggers, bows, arrows, and small medical items that cod treat poison and heal small wounds. Other than that, Zaltos was planning out what had to be done for the highest rate of success in his mind while talking, a natural instinct from being a king. Everyone was foreign here, and being who is, he done what he done naturally, take lead, knowing if they followed, he.would lay his life on the line for them.\"I'll let the wildfire grow a little more. I lost control of it when I was hit. It's wet from the rain earlier, so it will spread slowly,smoldering more. When we reach the top, I can look for the dragon and their tribe. From there, maybe Wolgang could have his men begin building a wall across the base of the plateau. We will need a homebase to plan and rest, possibly protect us from anythsing that might be out there. I have a feeling the Greydan will find what they are looking for.\" Zaltos thought to himself.\"Wolfgang, you are exploring. These are new lands for man... I have seen many new worlds start, and unless you're people earn it, whatever you establish will pass in time. You will find more.than just simple trade and eexploration here. You will find blood and death as well as gold and silver. If you follow the blood and death, in the end you will find life like no other filled with Nirvana and love. Gold and silver will lead you into darkness, enough never being enough, fading into time... If you will ccontinue on this, I will ensure you that you and your people will be have more than they ever expected.

It will absorb all magic, fire, heat, and physical damage.\" Zaltos spoke to Raven.\"Wolfgang, if this elf is capable of helping you, open a gate for the excess to go into. It needs to be a deep well to take in all this raw power. I'll take care of it afterwards. Between what I'll take in and that well, it should bring it down and what small fires exist outside of it are capable of being put out by the people. So i'm going to do my part, I have faith in you to take care of the rest.\" Zaltos spoke to the Wolfgang, being short and quick due to the situation.Zaltos took to a sprint and lept into the hottest spot in the fire. Immediately his power quadrupled. This was only the beginning. He was drawing his power out to prepare his wells for what was about to fill them. The immediate power jump would cause thr fire to blow inwards. What would unfold was going to be a marvelous sight despite the destruction it was going to cause. Anyone or anything within the range would definitely pick up Zaltos's powpower growth in the flames, hopefully nobody would interupt this. If he was interrupted too early, it would be catastrophic for the Free Plains. \"What I could do...I could destroy everything right now and nobody would know.\" Laughter stopped him, knowing he was seriously contemplating it. \"But, this is future land for The Phoenix State, so I'll spare it.\" Everything was a whisper, and being in the middle of the fire, his words had no way to be heard, not even by himself.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Zaltos would take the shield he gave to Wolfgang and set in in the ground.

A protective spell; a gate-like well that should do just fine to help you control your flames.\"Suddenly, an aura of pure, almost holy power enveloped Ildesias in a blindingly bright light; which was slowly drawn back along his body like a retreating ocean and began to pool into his eyes like water escaping down a drain. When nothing remained, the elf's eyes developed a potent blue glow that shone light around his face and cast a dark shadow under lips that now sang an ancient chant. As he chanted, the struggle between Trogdor and Zaltos would have taken place on The Free Plain, but it would not distract him from an almost meditative trance. If anything, he seemed to use the opportunity to make the spell stronger. With each verse of his song, the glow in his eyes brightened until by it's end it would be akin to peering into a pair of bright blue stars. \"O' gate of the ancient spirits; those who used the power of the Lake of Time's Beginning to battle those would rain endless fire upon the world. Lend me your strength! Draw upon these flames and douse them in the well of your collective waters. Draw upon them and save those who could be consumed!\"Suddenly, with a move elegant as it was quick, Ildesias drew his shining silver blade and pressed the tip into the ground between his feet. Within seconds, a circle of ancient stone formed around him in a wide area and began to rise with a slight shaking of the surrounding earth; until it was merely a foot tall. Then, within this stone, the ground began to split apart and crack; crumbling away into a hole of unnatural dark that began to fill with a bright and clear water with every second. Within this water, the morphed and twisted souls of the dead stretched themselves and swam in a crowded pool, moaning and singing with a thousand voices that seemed to combine as one the more one listened. Then, when the water reached the stone of the well's rim, they opened their mouths wide and began to draw in the surrounding air like a great beast taking in a breath. But more than that, they would begin to draw upon the flame and the wildfire, sucking it in from across the plateau and farther still and consuming it like a starving banshee would a man's soul. As this happened, Ildesias stood upon the surface of the water with an unnatural lightness and used his concentration to keep the well from closing; his pose powerful and holding the tip of his blade beneath the water's edge as though a key whilst bright, glowing eyes seemed to stare through all.
