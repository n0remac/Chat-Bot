Neva surely must know this too, as she has an even better view on the dragon than him. He is about to convey this information to her when the dragon finally makes it's move.\"Neva watch out!\" he calls out just moments after the dragon's huge head begins to move. Fol-lu himself hopes Neva can react in time with the help of his shouted warning. Fol-lu himself would be able to quite easily escape the current situation as despite the giant dragon's perhaps above average speed for its size Fol-lu's reflexes and speed were far beyond just above average for an elf, who were already known to be much quicker on their toes than a regular human would be.

It seemed it was rather ineffective even with the speed and power of which he was able to strike with the glaive. Under these circumstances, it was true that a weapon such as a great hammer or something of the sort would be a better option due to its greater mass, which would lend more power to any strike. Fol-lu would note this as he pulled his glaive from the smashed rock which it had lodged itself into. The glaive itself would seem to be completely undamaged, which was surprising since it's edge just slammed straight into solid rock with great force. It seemed the material the weapon was made of was designed to sustain much greater forces than what it was put through thus far.Turning around, Fol-lu would see much to his dismay, the dragon's inferno hitting Neva directly as she had dived in front of it. Her sacrifice shocked Fol-lu, and caused his anger to grow slightly. This was just what he wanted to avoid, if anything it should have been him leaping in front of the flames to save them. Still, it seemed Neva's sacrifice blocked the hottest of the flames, which Fol-lu was thankful for. The dragon would at this point start charging headfirst into the inferno with Fol-lu still on top of his head. This was quite unfortunate, yet Fol-lu had to think fast if he wanted to avoid being burnt to a crisp or falling off Artem's head as he tilted it downwards.\u00a0He knew of a certain trick he could pull off with his glaive if he spun it fast enough, and figured it might be the most efficient course of action in this given situation. Quickly, Fol-lu began twirling the glaive in his hands as he widened his stance so as to not lose his balance as the thrust of the spinning glaive increased. The spin grew in speed exponentially and would keep increasing in velocity until it was but a blur of swirling steel which formed a powerful vortex of wind above\u00a0Fol-lu's head. This would accomplish the task of dispersing the fire in Fol-lu's path and keep him from being burned by blowing the cool air behind him forward into the inferno and creating a small pocket of air within the blaze of fire. it would also direct any of the diamond shards The speed at which he spun the glaive was incredibly fast, fast enough that it created a downwards force that would make Fol-lu remain firmly planted to Artem's head despite the ninety-degree inclination he stood upon. It would also direct any of the diamond shards Va'nei had launched his way off course slightly, just enough so that they would instead embed themselves in the rocky hide of Artem that surrounded him or be deflected by the dragon's tear itself, so great was the speed of the wind. It was a risky strategy, given that if Fol-lu's wind did not blow fast enough it would only make the flames hotter, but due to Neva's sacrifice it seemed the inferno was weakened just enough to make this strategy work.The front of wind Fol-lu had formed lost its effectiveness towards the tail end of the blaze, however, as the air behind Fol-lu was on fire, and would only pull more flames onto himself. As for the barrage of diamond shards, they seem to have all passed at this point.\u00a0With his previous strategy to avoid being incinerated obsolete, he reached a sort of conundrum. He knew had to preserve his magic rather than waste it in this moment if he could, and would hold off on using it as he stopped the spin of his glaive, and within a split second lodged his glaive in between the cracks formed in the rock from his last strike and the top edge of the gem itself so as to avoid falling. For a quite a few seconds Fol-lu was in the blaze, his armor warming and soon becoming hot enough to start burning him. He also had to hold his breath, to prevent inhaling the hot air that began to surround him, yet just when he thought he would have to cast some sort of barrier to avoid suffering even more serious burns which would incapacitate him, he was through the hottest part of the inferno and reaching its fringes near the walls of the cavern. It seemed that Neva had at least reduced its range with her sacrifice as well, and though through the fire and flames he would see Artem's target, Va'nei. The giant dragon was closing in with a considerable deal of speed given his size, enough speed to indicate that he had no intention of stopping at the cavern wall if he missed his mark and attempting to crush him. \u00a0It was at this point that Fol-lu had an idea, as he thought back to his ineffectual attempt to pry the Dragon's Tear from Artem's rocky head as well as his previous spell he had cast before riding Neva.\u00a0Fol-lu would, grasp his weapon tightly, following the length of it until he gained a foothold among the cracks where he would take the opportunity to orient his glaive at more of a downwards angle. This reposition would only take half a second as Fol-lu moved very quickly, and then he would hold on as he began to chant his spell.One can note that he had been able\u00a0to cast to cast his spells mentally before, now, however, he would have to verbally pronounce the incantation needed to remain focused in those hectic moments, \"Voran sia unthrumagok...\"As Fol-lu intoned those very fist words, Artem would now notice Fol-lu's weight considerably increased weight upon his head. This would be Fol-lu's normal weight, as he had only decreased it before so Neva could actually lift him off the ground. As he released this initial spell to make him lighter, a burst of air would break away from him, the barrier which held his weight previously being removed in a flash of light. The increased weight along with the downward angle of the glaive which he had clung to would force the weapon downwards slightly under the greatly increased weight, wedging the weapon in deeper underneath the top edge of the Dragon's Tear, yet he was not finished,\"Vur xurwk coi kiarf jennuilt loupon ghoros!\"Fol-lu's form immediately becomes the epicenter of a great burst of magical energy, his mass growing exponentially at that very moment. Artem would immediately find that Fol-lu's weight had increased to such a degree that it would be comparable to another Artem'Mahlyn'Sur resting atop his head, which would make it very difficult for him to continue his charge, or lift his head given the concentrated weight of Fol-lu's form pushing down on his head and the Dragon's Tear. This enormous weight would have caused the stony hide upon which Fol-lu stood upon to crumble,and cause him to slide off, yet he also accounted for this when he lodged his glaive in beneath the top edge of the dragon's tear. If he was going to become dislodged and fall downwards, the dragon's tear would dislodge itself along with him. It was also possible this weight would not be enough to dislodge the Dragon's Tear and instead force Artem's snout downwards into the rock due to the sheer weight that pushed down on him, which was equal in weight to the gigantic dragon himself. This would most likely crush Artem's skull against the rock below, or form a crater in the shape of his snout. Either way, the muscles that held his head up, especially as he held it now - outstretched forward in a charge, would not be enough to hold up his own weight.(two charges used -> zero charges)", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Fol-lu's brow would crease slightly at the limited success of his attack.

This was quite a surprise as Fol-lu thought he had wedged it into the rock quite thoroughly, and thus was uncharacteristically caught off guard and not ready to catch himself, sending him into a free fall. Fol-lu still would not fall into a panic for a few moments in the beginning of his fall, despite the extreme acceleration his enormous weight (equal to Artem's at this point) would cause as he fell.He would just need to dispell his last spell before he hit the ground and... his line of thought and concentration was blown away the moment dragon let loose that powerful shockwave of energy, leading into a chain of events that would defeat him.His armor would protect him from the deadly hail of rocks, yet the impact of the shockwave itself would not be entirely mitigated by armor, nor would the impacts of the rocks on his armor be nullified either. A shockwave that was powerful enough to pulverize bones and turn organs to liquid was mitigated enough by his armor though, to the point where Fol-lu would be able to survive, though he was far from unscathed. The pain from the injuries inflicted in that instant would make it impossible for him to concentrate enough to release his weight spell, or slow his fall.At some point, moments after he was hit by the shockwave, Fol-lu would lose grip of his glaive, the weapon sent hurtling in the blast before landing below in a small explosion of rock, the glaive seemed to weight quite a bit itself. Fol-lu himself would reach the ground even before the glaive did as he himself weighed much more. The force of the impact for such a small object as Fol-lu falling onto the ground would seem almost impossibly powerful. The entire cavern would rumble as if Artem himself had fell over, and bits of rock and boulders went flying across the cavern. Fol-lu landed on his back, the force of the fall breaking the stone beneath him and forming a relatively (compared to the forces involved) small yet deep crater.The impact of the fall would also break Fol-lu, as it were. He already had several bones broken in the previous shockwave but the fall would finish the job, breaking several more bones and causing massive damage all throughout his body. Of course, he had lost consciousness the moment he hit the ground, the pain too much for any waking being to experience. The fact that he was still even alive was a miracle in of itself, even with the supernatural durability he seemed to possess - if he had not been so resistant to damage he would be a pile of unrecognizable flesh at the moment, and most certainly dead. On the bright side, the spell which previously increased his weight would break once he fell unconcious\u00a0and was unable to maintain it.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The elf only found momentary success in his strategy before Artem's head shifted downwards under the weight, and his glaive broke free.
