At one point or another it was stricken with cataclysm so great that it opened up the heart of the world itself.  Literally, Colossal chasms and canyons reach down to the fiery depths of hell itself. The environment is erratic and varies abruptly between a multitude of known biomes. What isn't tangled in vicious swamps or gnarled forests features lumpy savanna and isolated deserts. The climate is mostly warm and very humid\u2014even in the deserts. The skies never seem to clear. Around the outer cloister of the realm are great cathedral like clouds  with charcoal underbellies. They appear to be rotating inward, albeit slowly. Lightening is prevalent and known to cause wildfires. The weather anomaly intensifies the deeper in one travels. Even days and nights are affected, stretching over the span of a week each. As is the rest of the land, weather is erratic in nature.  Pockets of violent monsoons can appear without warning and leave as abruptly as they spawn.There is a wide array of vegetation that grows here, but none of which seems quite like the outer world. Many offensive and toxic plants dwell within the sundered frontier. On the other hand, a select few hold preternatural effects of benefit. Alas these are few and far between. Day dwelling fauna range from extraordinary undulates to big cats of prey. Those which awaken when the realm is dark appear to rise straight from the nightmares of the insane. Huge alien beasts emerge from their burrows and caves to ravage the nightly realm. Magic functions differently  in these lands. A great overriding force suppresses all forms of magic unless derived from traditional usage. It does not nullify, but significantly diminishes effectiveness. Blood and souls are demanded in exchange for magic. If none are available, casters are immediately aware of the siphoning of their own vitality. Virtually, there is no information of these lands in any archive. Save for an encampment of archaeologists which can paint a broad\u2014albeit vague\u2014idea of the place, the only way to truly understand is to explore. As of now, the only natural way in is a simple suspension bridge spanning across a hundred feet of bottomless chasm.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/fD2x1df.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><font size=\"5\">The Sundered Frontier<br><br/><br/><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/fD2x1df.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/></br></font></div>"}, "post-68893": {"user": "Plague", "user_num": 2350, "timestamp": "1496415314000", "message": "The sky was dim with amber light, but light nonetheless. Darkness had finally retreated from over the Blightlands. Despite the occasional snap of colossal static striking terrain, the weather was as moderate as it could ever be.

From the dusty green saw grass grew broad trees that seemed to stretch further out than they did up. Their leaves were long and curly with jagged teeth.

This was the presence of some form of industry. The body responsible for this trade was Plague. Plague was a mostly humanoid being. Save for the jet black skin and the jackal head, he could have passed for any run of the mill human. His wardrobe was of humble burlap. Though humble in material, the craftsmanship of his attire was nearly perfect. The clothes fit him well. From tunic to baggy pants. Today he was observed with more to his daily wardrobe. Over his shoulder was a leather sack. Over his head was a hood and mask. His hands were concealed in two long gloves which were secured at his elbows. To one of these portly trees he strode casually before taking a knee at it's massive trunk.At the foot of one of these trees, he pulled forth from the bag his tools of trade. A large carving knife which featured two handles. Two wide mouth vats of clay. A screw like piece of metal, hollowed out like an over-sized syringe. A large piece of leather was pulled out and unfolded. As if was opened, it featured the shape of half a tree skirt. As it's shape was evident, this was set below the area which Plague sought to work.Without much ceremony, he took the draw knife in both hands and lifted it over his head. The curved blade was then plunged into the dense, yet soft bark. He carefully sheered the pale dusty bark from the reddish brown wood. Rather than allowing one large sliver to wobble about, it was skillfully spun into multiple chunks which fell to the leather below.Plague so began the grueling task of harvest...

His choice of attire was relatively simple, but intended to share the same purpose as the cloth upon his features. Clad in a pair of baggy, cloth pants, a tattered, white tunic, and a hooded cloak, he also wore a set of calve-high boots and a single belt that held a set of five leather pouches and four vials as well as a single sheath.From the rigors of his training to obtain the immunity to toxins and poisons, he kept his hands bare and, ahead of the strange being was a plain that was once a home to a vast array of toxic vegetation. Now, it was almost a mere shadow of itself, housing useless stems and patches of grass, and it was this very strange being who was responsible for its state by making use of its resources.The rumble of thunder crackled closely to his location and gave him warning of the time he presently had. With that in mind, he knelt beside one of the remaining plants and procured his dagger from its sheath. Elven in design, its blade was curved and its handle appeared almost decorative with strips of silver lining its grip in a swirled pattern.In a swift and precise swipe, the plant was severed from its base and housed in one of his pouches before the action was repeated with the next to commence his collecting.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "With the amber illumination creeping its way across the vast sky, orange eyes surveyed the landscape as the darkness made its lethargic retreat.

One wrong move, one slipped blade, or a nonchalant wipe of the brow was all it would take. The very essence of this plant was toxic.

It was a ghastly neurotoxin that wasn't exactly fatal, but triggered the must intense pain that any could possibly comprehend. It's effects lingered for days, months, or even years depending on how long the stuff stayed on the skin. Taking a knee, Plague placed the tool on the ground. Perhaps there was something he had failed to produce before, because the rough cloth shrouded figure was back in that large leather bag. It didn't take much digging to find the hand crank drill. After standing, he'd pres it against the bare reddish wood and begin to twist. The wood was soft enough to yield, albeit slowly. Shaving spiraled out from the bore zone. They tumbled down the trunk and onto the swath of leather below. His broad shoulders rocked with the repetitive and tedious act of drilling far enough into the wood to yield the best sap results. It was a process that was going to take some time. Without much focus, he simply gazed in the direction of the drill while his hands worked the action with the grace of a season artisan. His form and the tree were soon illuminated with a bright white flash followed instantly by a loud crash. Overhead, a large arc of lightening happened to discharge. Save for a slight wince of his coffee black eyes, His composure wasn't disrupted all that much. Plague was used to this sort of environment.

Woody thorns each with their own array of fine barbs stuck out from their respective stems. Where the forest converged upon a large front of jagged mountains, their compound was located. The security of their home wasn't advanced. There was really only need for a simple wall to separate their home from the harsh world.
