And then she watched in wide-eyed astonishment as the elemental was freed, and moved to assist her. The knowledge that flooded into her, that she now had a bond the likes of which was naught but legend among the Orcs.. it was, in a word, unbelievable. She nodded up at the elemental as it touched her shoulder, imparting her respect and her thanks for its help in unspoken words.. then she wobbled and flopped back onto her bum on the canyon floor.<br><br/>And then she began to <i>laugh.</i> It was a merry sound painted with disbelief and happiness, her entire body shaking with the force of her mirth. To think, they had been sent on a quest for Daris, and she ended up with an earth elemental! Not to mention her first battle scar. Soon enough, she was laughing so hard that tears were streaming down her face, no matter how she tried to wipe them away.
