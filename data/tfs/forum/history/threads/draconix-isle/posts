Her only armor was an old set of chain mail on top of a moth-eaten gambeson, some leather boots, and a coif which didn't even cover her neck properly. Her only skills were a few lessons in sword-fighting.The only significant advantage she had was a strange spirit guardian which her teacher had referred to as a Stand. And while it had proven its worth against common bandits and an enemy mage or two, it was absolutely no match for a dragon, at least not yet.
