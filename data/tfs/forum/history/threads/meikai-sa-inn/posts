The establishment consists of a small number of buildings crowded together.The tea house consists of two floors with a number of tables to seat and serve, ringed about a large stage for dancers and musicians to offer a show to guests. There are also a number of more secluded tables, \"boothed\" corners for quieter parties away from the entertainment. The place is finely decorated with carefully trimmed bonsai trees and foliage, as well as lovely water streams and fountains - a very homely and inviting environment to bring a sense of ease to guests. Out back behind the building is a sectioned off plot of land - a garden to help keep fresh produce on hand.There is also a spacious inn right next door, available through the tea house and from outside - owned and run by the same owners. The rooms are clean and kept, cozy but warm despite the colder temperatures that blow in from the mountains time to time. Maids scurry about to manage the place, keep it clean and bring up room service if called upon, as well as tend to the gardens around the property. Among the pretty gardens and fragrant flowers, which are accessible by the guests at their leisure, there is an extensive koi pond filled with many colorful fish that are eager to be fed - able to be walked by via paths or a bridge over the water.The quiet jewel of the establishment? A third building houses hot baths, supplied by the hot springs of the mountain. Inside the building there are two separated baths - to allow privacy to men and woman that stay and visit them. The springs are also open to visitors, privacy fences erect to prevent passersby to peer upon people and also allow the same privacy between women and men.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://guidewithme.com/apk/Japan/content/data/images/togetsuan_entrance.jpg", "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TNf_Fh-uvzRF1xDEXgR7vrBAdz2Eye5rAI1ky_U-GCvIj05USPYIYj-Yz89k3LgYosfX7xSXeKXc4xFiXvrp10CXPO4RKpNWrvJaAPKGF-h7Ch704XY7KZBYGBXqQvzHD0nZk3jh", "http://www.japanesegardenpasadena.com/images/slide3.jpg"], "html": "To the northeast from the grand Imperial City, nestled at the foot of a mountain from the ridge that blocks off the Great Divide, sits a retreat of source.
