In the twenty years since his flight from Gauldin and his unexpected reward of his own lands, the Lyon of\u00a0Rond\u00f3n has since lead his lands with the nobility and grace that the man he once was never did. Dotted with vineyards, a quiet and well patrolled land that he has since kept bandit free is a welcomed sight. And though it rests on the far reaches of\u00a0Rond\u00f3n, he has never allowed the dangers of the realms or creatures beyond to interfere with daily life.Lord Renard's abode is a small, fortifiable abode atop a hill in the small town of Vala. Adorned with flags and pennons of his glory days, adorned with the shields and lances of his fallen troops, it remains an impressive home that harkens back to his days of youth spent as a fighting man and the feud that changed his life. The sounds of soldiers training in the courtyard can always be heard, as he maintains a strict militant presence and lends his troops for a modest price throughout\u00a0Rond\u00f3n. Nobility of Rond\u00f3n are always welcomed to visit, and he has more than once opened his doors to travelers and the like. Though retired from the battlefield himself, he can be seen sparring with the recruits, sharing stories and wine on his terrace or entertaining his green thumb in his gardens.Good folk of courage, talespinners or downtrodden can always find one night of hospitality in Castella Lyonesse.

More than one saluted or nodded the scholar's way, noting the peculiar and distinct appearance.

No doubt a man such as the Lion would not cower away, but the question was whether or not he would want to take part in Xiu Xiu's musings. The stairwell, yes. One leg up after another, about halfway she found herself tired. Such a menial task and she had nearly failed it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As they breached into the anachronistic diner, the Lion wished of her to have a meal and talk tall stories in exchange for his aiding hand.

For her, a thick mist set in just fifteen metres out from the table; the visible world found itself grey and a faint green, the only sense of light coming from a large, fiery ball in the sky which, with all of its sunset strength, only managed to pierce enough to make sure her world was not pitch black. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There was a chill.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The chair was a comforting escape from her day of travel.

An answer to be, most delicately handled, by science tonight at this table.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Lion offered most likely his best beverage to signify his standing in society, but she politely shook her head. A hand from below the table held a crumpled piece of paper; as it came above, she flattened it out. There were delicate diagrams, mostly made up of circles, and foreign writing scrawled itself alongside them. After she poured water into her glass, she dropped it in.

I faded away, and awoke floating in the lava. There was no pain, but all of my possessions had been burnt away, and everything did not seem as it should have. I couldn't see the ceiling, I couldn't feel my body as I used to, and my mind intrusively shoved shapes into my eyesight. At that point, I no longer sought the ancient city.

When he spoke, the words were dragged from his mouth with care, as though each syllable was a struggle to decide upon.

Many have been too short here, upon the surface, and fiends hide in the guises of mortals and in their own souls. Hell, they say, is sometimes other people.\"He paused and sipped his wine, leaning back into his chair to look longingly into the setting sun. \"I remember a world long ago. One I that was full of glory, full of dreams and fulfillment. Where anything was possible and all days were filled with song, laughter and joy. I remember the heart of Gauldin, hearing it beat in my ears every day, with every smile, with every song and feast. Have you ever laid eyes upon the fair lands of Gauldin? the rolling hills and white capped mountains? The cerulean seas along her coasts and the charm of its song and poetry? Inspiration lives in every soul in Gauldin and once, I stood beside noble men and noble women, who by the grace of God and all that was right, ruled without fear. But, as we said, there are world aplenty, even before our very eyes yet not within sight.\"\"Now, she is torn apart by the wolves of war, a culmination of her faults and blinded vision. Have you ever looked upon something that defies your raison d'etre? Your entire being? Challenged the facets of your understanding? I too, was thrust into great fires that left me changed, no longer the being that entered that fateful crucible. The fiend that clutched me was the shadow of Gauldin, the truth of my countrymen so warped and twisted they could not know dream from reality.\"\"It began when I was but a man halfway through his second decade. Surely, your mind can grasp that bygone age of glory, as I assure you that century is not beyond recollection. The summer winds were dying and the trees bled golden leaves, dressing Gauldin for glorious autumn. If memory serves, the Duke of Lorrain had marched his House's soldiers against the borders of Rondon, his feud with Signore Luccio reaching new heights. That morning was crisp, as the fog had nod dissolved under the lazing eye of the sun and they still lingered like the aimless spirits of the night prior in the valley beyond me. His Majesty had tasked me with the cessation of hostilies, a noble task that was not beneath me. I was still a General then. Loved. Feared. Respected. I observed from a hill well beyond both Luccio's and Lorrain's soldiers, a friendly reminder of what would come should their squabble not come to an end. Of course, the pride of Gauldin's nobility is a constant, like the stars and the moon. And Lorrain? His blood was bluer than the sea.\"\"I still remember when Lorrain sounded the silver trumpets. I lived for that clarion call like a sailor did to the sound of lapping waves and the scent of saltwater. These men would finally set their squabble aside with a final show of steel, spilling blood into the earth to consecrate their final agreement. But I watched as Luccio led the charge and Lorrain sat upon his steed, ordering his men to march forward. The battle was short lived, as most battles are. Only sieges last forever, mademoiselle, and let none tell you otherwise. Luccio was surrounded and the white flag rose. An entire year of bloodshed and fury along their border between them, finished by the time the last of the fog was gone. I watched as Lorrain sat upon his steed and sent his men into Luccio's lands, forcing him to observe as soldiers marched upon Luccio's home.\"He was quiet a few moments, his eyes misty.\"Fiends hide in the hearts of men, my dear. Those are the most wicked monsters I have ever met. Those from Hell have no choice but to be as they are. But men who choose to be fiends? Their hearts are blacker than the Hell they have sold their souls to. As to what happened to Lorrain and Luccio? Well...A story for another time, perhaps. I fear I may have rambled.
