Only seconds later the wind began to kick and lightning cracked through the air. Ravis had never seen the weather turn so sour so fast. He began walking blindly in one direction cursing the forest, the weather, his life, and just about anything else he could think to curse.\u00a0It was only through squinting eyes did Ravi's notice the decrepit manor. Wildlife and foiliage had began growing through and around it. Ravis took off towards the manor, some roof was no roof. He pushed the front door open and entered. The main thing entryway was dark, a single tree grew between two spiral stair cases that lead to the second floor.
