The structure is clearly very old and its origins are a mystery. Some claim it was built in a time before the land was a swamp and some claim it was built by the Swamp King when he ruled the Darkwald. Nearly all agree on one fact however, few go to the Hollow Hall and even fewer return from it. Many claim it is simply haunted by the spirits that died out in the swamp, but there are rumors something much worse than a ghost resides in it.To enter the Hollow Hall, one must make their way over a surprisingly long stone bridge, which passes over some exceptionally deep swamp water. A number of chestplates and helms from adventurers can be seen in the water below, implying there may be more than your standard fare of creatures in this swamp. Although the bridge itself isn\u2019t in particularly good shape, the castle, despite being old, is surprisingly well kept, unnaturally so almost. There are also numerous stone statues on the bridge as well as on the walls of the hall itself.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/vgXuc7l.jpg"], "html": "<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/vgXuc7l.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}, "post-27637": {"user": null, "user_num": null, "timestamp": "1457387896000", "message": "They came marching like soldiers.Marching with ease, and many slouching, barely any with formation, came the Ogres from the Mountains.

Would the bridge support their weight was a stupidly ignored question, as the race was quite more focused on an objective in mind rather than the smaller details.There they stopped, the massive heathens, standing at the beginning of the other side of the bridge, a larger, most-armored ogre stomping forward out of the sixty of them, battle axes lowered to his sides as he waited for The Hungry One to come forth to him, the others scratching and snorting and burping and growling, but all remaining quiet as the official of the group waited.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/c2/63/09/c26309da345cccfab819c5c690b62fd6.jpg"], "html": "They came marching like soldiers."}, "post-27657": {"user": "Grandma", "user_num": 602, "timestamp": "1457401046000", "message": "The inhabitant of the hall had taken note of the Ogres as they approached, infact, it had sensed them far before they had even come into sight of the Hollow Hall.

However, after a time, a feeling of uneasiness would settle over the swamp. Although there would be no visible changes initially, the Ogres would sense a change in the air itself. Then the fog would start rolling in. It was a thick, unnatural fog, clearly a product of something other than nature. The Ogres would find it difficult to see very far at all, even seeing from one end of the bridge to the other would be difficult. The eerie silence of the hall would finally be broken.
