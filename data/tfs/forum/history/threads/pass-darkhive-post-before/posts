Her behavior up until now was distinctly good, although a bit selfish and self-righteous she supposed. Then again she was rather power-hungry and jealous too. Not to mention the weird stuff she was into... There was a distinction to be made between light and darkness and good and evil. True, light generally prefers good, and darkness generally prefers evil. But based on her grandmother's notes, the two were not inexorably linked, and light and dark energy actually were two halves of the same coin. To be dark didn't necessarily mean one was evil, nor was to be light necessarily mean one was good.A simpler explanation of light and darkness was that light was represented by exertion towards the outside of oneself in the form of creation, healing, love, control, etc. Darkness had more to do with protecting the self, concerned with self-reflection, destruction, anger, and passivity.Jun still struggled with this distinction, which even gods had difficulty with.
