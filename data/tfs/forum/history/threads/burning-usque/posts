If Jarkoopi did not retreat he would soon find Trogdor's terrible teeth about his neck.Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui was about to blast the mage away just as Trogdor prowled behind him and taunted him. How predictable. Of course he of all people would forgo wisdom for the thrill of battle. Luckily for Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui, he too usually favored the path of war. He kept still, watching the big red dragon behind him with his eyes.\"You are a fool. Come here and die.\"Rather then let Trogdor rip apart his backside, Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui would roll over right before Trogdor came down upon him, exposing his much softer underbelly, but it also allowed him to use all four arms and legs to shred Trogdor into strips. His hardened tail would extend, pointed to piece Trogdor's lower guts as he fell down, and should it pierce deeply, the spikes further down his tail would act as barbs to further rip his insides. His arms would also grasp Trogdor's shoulders as well, looking to grasp and tear flesh from that part and also help cushion the sheer force of the impact as they locked into a dragon-sized wrestling match. He would dedicate his own legs into denying Trogdor any sizeable blows against his body by swatting his foe's feet away as they came in for a strike. His legs were likely to be torn and hurt, but it ultimately would help protect him. His jaw went for his opponent's throat, not to tear it from his neck, but to keep him from aiming his flaming breath. If he could secure a solid grasp, he would keep his opponent's face pointed away from his torso and neck.The biggest mistake made however, had to be the fact Trogdor went to grapple the slightly smaller storm dragon. The electrical charge inside him was stored, and when he made contact with Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui, Trogdor just became part of a closed circuit between him, Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui and the ground. Enough energy flowed through his foe to cause a few seconds worth of muscle contractions/control and a very strong tingling feeling throughout his nervous system. There was no time to defend himself with magic as the transfer was instant through their contact points when they touched. At best hopes Trogdor would become stunned/weakened long enough for Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui to flip him over and gain the height advantage.(Charge used)", "link_list": ["/post/59635/thread", "/user/145", "/user/102", "/user/145", "/user/102", "/user/145", "/user/102", "/user/145", "/user/145", "/user/145", "/user/145", "/user/145", "/user/102", "/user/145", "/user/102", "/user/145", "/user/102"], "image_list": ["https://steemitimages.com/DQmcerScqknrKTrBwPUKoThMEKw6dZrtziNEE51aewzgjk3/flame%20dragon_smell.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@trogdor\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/59635/thread\" timestamp=\"1485378187\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-145\" title=\"Trogdor\"><img alt=\"Trogdor Avatar\" src=\"https://steemitimages.com/DQmcerScqknrKTrBwPUKoThMEKw6dZrtziNEE51aewzgjk3/flame%20dragon_smell.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/59635/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1485378187000\" title=\"Jan 25, 2017 13:03:07 GMT -8\">Jan 25, 2017 13:03:07 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-145 group-0\" href=\"/user/145\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@trogdor\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Trogdor</span></a></span> said:</div>\"<font color=\"#ff0000\">Huk, huk, huk</font>\"  The maniacal creature laughed at how well his impromptu plan was working. \"<font color=\"#ff0000\">You desire knowledge?

The storm dragon should have sensed something happening to the fire beast's aura. The furnace within Trogdor burned so hot that scales began to glow.  The heat continued to fuse with the dragons aura.  Trogdor was becoming fire and rage incarnate.The ferocity and dedication of Trogdor \u2019s assault stunned Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui  as he began to question how far his foe would go just to beat him. There was a suppressed feeling of panic that Trogdor  was slowly taking the lead, but the storm dragon showed no mental weakness yet.After the combined success of his piercing tail and electrocution combination, Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui  was too occupied to stop Trogdor  from bringing down one of his claws upon his neck. He could grab hold, but due to the thickness of Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui \u2019s neck, his hand couldn\u2019t fully reach around to have a solid grip, and even if he could, he risked his hand being impaled by the sharpened spikes upon the back of the blue dragon\u2019s neck. Without much to prevent him from not reacting, Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui  angled his head down to meet Trogdor \u2019s headbutt. Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui \u2019s head was knocked back, but with his preparation, not much was done other than pushing his skull away. Trogdor  wouldn\u2019t have too much trouble pinning Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui \u2019s arm and shifting his weight, specifically with gravity on his side. His right arm would be pressed by his opponents claw and his tearing of his shoulder would stop. While Trogdor  had more control and the advantage here, his blind rage was letting Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui  do exceptional amounts of damage.His tail sliced off armored scales and flesh from Trogdor \u2019s right side with good effect, so why not do it again? This time, with a thrusting attack, his tail sought to pierce as far as possible straight into the wounded area of his leg, most likely catching great amounts of muscles and tendons and making his rear right leg impossible to use with the massive pain and the fact that there would be a massive hole in his limb almost going straight through. Once his tail made it in, he would forcefully rip it out. The barbs along it could catch even more flesh and fling it out from his body, scattering it among the ashes.While his grip on Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui \u2019s neck, headbutt, and pinning his right arm were mostly successful, now that softer tissue was exposed where his left claw was cutting, he could begin to do more internal damage at his joint and hopefully release the pin on his other arm.With Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui \u2019s right leg, he pressed up against the red dragon\u2019s underside, not to particularly do damage, but to keep Trogdor  from trying to squash him. His left leg would go on a much greater offense however. Trogdor \u2019s right side was weakened, and Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui  sought to do as much damage as physically possible to the one leg, dismembering if needed. With the combined damage on his weakened leg and him being too distracted with Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui \u2019s neck and arms, Trogdor \u2019s right leg was seriously unprotected and thus, in lots of trouble. Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui  did not care how much damage he did, if victory meant severing Trogdor \u2019s leg, then so be it.Without much to daze Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui , he could concentrate on channeling some magic for a defense to whatever power was amassing in Trogdor \u2026(Charge 1)", "link_list": ["/post/59715/thread", "/user/145", "/user/145", "/user/102", "/user/145", "/user/102", "/user/145", "/user/102", "/user/102", "/user/145", "/user/102", "/user/145", "/user/102", "/user/145", "/user/102", "/user/145", "/user/102", "/user/102", "/user/145", "/user/145", "/user/102", "/user/102", "/user/145", "/user/102", "/user/145", "/user/102", "/user/145"], "image_list": ["https://steemitimages.com/DQmcerScqknrKTrBwPUKoThMEKw6dZrtziNEE51aewzgjk3/flame%20dragon_smell.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@trogdor\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/59715/thread\" timestamp=\"1485471162\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-145\" title=\"Trogdor\"><img alt=\"Trogdor Avatar\" src=\"https://steemitimages.com/DQmcerScqknrKTrBwPUKoThMEKw6dZrtziNEE51aewzgjk3/flame%20dragon_smell.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/59715/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1485471162000\" title=\"Jan 26, 2017 14:52:42 GMT -8\">Jan 26, 2017 14:52:42 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-145 group-0\" href=\"/user/145\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@trogdor\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Trogdor</span></a></span> said:</div>It was true that the thrill of battle had caused Trogdor to act irrationally, but his natural instincts drove him to capitalize on his advantages. Jarkoopi seemed confident, but he had already made too many mistakes to grapple his way to victory. <br><br/>The larger storm dragon was slow in rolling and would not be able to move as fast as Trogdor, who was smaller and more agile. Anticipating some sort of counter attack, Trogdor was ready to grasp Jarkoopi's razor tail as it swung to impale him. Trogdor arched his back and descended like a hawk catching a field mouse. However, the red dragon did not expect to be electrocuted. Trogdor twisted his lower body away from the pain and the razor tail sliced through his right leg and flank.  Scales and blood went flying and though the wound was not deep, Trogdor's foot had been maimed and lower right side heavily numbed. <br/><br/>The pain did little to effect Trogdor's focus. This was nothing compared to the agony that was so familiar to the fearful creature's soul. Jarkoopi was much mistaken if he thought he could find his foe's neck when Trogdor had attacked first. Trogdor was already reaching for Jarkoopi's neck with his left claw when the twist away from the lower attack accentuated the motion. Trogdor would land in somewhat of a side press. Since Jarkoopi had chosen to go for both of Trogdor's shoulders, instead of protecting his exposed neck, Trogdor would have no problem using the height advantage to reach around his opponents arms and grasp him by the throat. At the same time he tucked his head in order to deliver a concussive skull bash to Jarkoopi's exposed chin.  The blue dragon was a fool to act so aggressively when he was obviously in a situational disadvantage. With Jarkoopi's head knocked away and possibly dizzied Trogdor would have nothing preventing him from clamping down on the long neck in a not so passive manner.<br/><br/>While concentrating on the neck, Trogdor's right hind leg would surely take more damage to Jarkoopi's desperate scrabbling. Jarkoopi would be able to sink his claws into Trogdor's right shoulder, but would find little leverage to deal significant damage.  In response, Trogdor would push with his left hind leg to keep his weight on top of Jarkoopi in order to keep him from rolling. Trogdor's right talon would attack Jarkoopi's elbow, attempting to break the hold on the shoulder.  Jarkoopi's right arm would likely be pinned or have little range of motion .<br/><br/>Trogdor's new ability continued to unlock and Jarkoopi had not noticed. The storm dragon should have sensed something happening to the fire beast's aura. The furnace within Trogdor burned so hot that scales began to glow.  The heat continued to fuse with the dragons aura.  Trogdor was becoming fire and rage incarnate.<br/><div class=\"quote_clear\"></div></br></div></div>"}, "post-59946": {"user": "Trogdor", "user_num": 145, "timestamp": "1486066902000", "message": "Nostrils flared in anticipation of the kill.

His goal was to end the fight swiftly.Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui  cared little about petty fires at this point, this forest meant only a little to him. He expected Trogdor  to do something with his magical reserves, but he hadn\u2019t thought Trogdor  would directly apply his mana to boost his personal strength and quickness, and slightly caught Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui  off guard.Even though Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui  would compensate for Trogdor \u2019s incoming claw by angling his scales upon his neck and moving it as far as he could while it was still partially pinned, the tips of Trogdor \u2019s claws would draw blood. The quick strike peeled scales and tore flesh as it sliced through Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui \u2019s neck, had he not worked with what little room to move he had, it could\u2019ve gone deeper and potentially be fatal.Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui  knew his foe would try going for the throat, and had his magic prepared just for that, but he didn\u2019t think Trogdor  would use his magic to speed himself up so much. With his enhanced speed, Trogdor  could slide his razor teeth onto to Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui \u2019s neck and gain the bitter taste of a little blood, but before he could deliver the deadly crunch upon the blue dragon\u2019s neck, he disappeared in a puff of smoke followed by a crack of lightning. He had teleported away from directly under Trogdor ! (Charge used)About 100 meters away, Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui  was hovering in place above the treeline, the sun gleaming off his scales and Trogdor \u2019s own flesh and blood dripping from his tail and legs. However with the light, Trogdor  could see a thick red substance dripping down the blue dragon\u2019s neck, one spot for his claw, and the other where his teeth had made an impression. He\u2019d done damage, but Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui \u2019s escape from his hold had definitely helped escape with his life.However, the retreat his teleport had given him didn\u2019t allow Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui  to be in an advantageous position to close in and attack, so he kept his distance and looked to see how Trogdor  would do on such a damaged leg once whatever mad rage or adrenaline he was on ran out. For now he kept the range, taunting his opponent through his neck injuries, while also hoping he would yield or retreat.\u201cYou like the sight of blood, but there are much better people to see dead than you or I.
