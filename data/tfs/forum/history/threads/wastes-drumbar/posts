He wrapped the scarf even closer around his face and looked to the pass in the horizon, his determination having carried him this far. He banged his staff twice into the ice, a whirlwind emitting from the tip, creating a momentary path through the horrid weather. His spells and clothing were keeping him from freezing, but the weather was still fierce to the point where he could feel it in his bones.His fingers struggled to roll out a scroll of parchment, his tired old eyes flickering across the page. He ran a thick index finger across the paper and then looked up towards the pass mumbling to himself in anything but English. He produced a smirk and put away the scroll, for he had found his destination.
