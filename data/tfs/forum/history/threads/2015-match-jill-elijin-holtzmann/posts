He wore no shirt just a few leather straps that created an x over his body and held the sheath for his sword breaker knife and the other cradling a leather whip infused with some metal for strength. His pants revealed more than they attempted to hide as they were skin tight around his legs ending right before the knee. His choice of foot wear was a pair of gladiatorial sandals which were laced on taunt. The last article of clothing he wore was the leather bracers he never removed.His exit from the tunnel had his hands raised high as if he was the returning champion or something and his walk had him occasionally tripping as he had blindfolded himself before his entrance. Nevertheless the man had a huge grin on his face as he entered.\"Now who happens to be my opponent I missed your introduction over the applause for me.\" Elijin boasted as he stood not staring at his opponent but towards a wall.

Her native clothing, as a dancer, was thus adapted well to airing today's heat. A jewel-encrusted, sleeveless top and loosely fitting pants similar in style to harem or salwar, both of dark purple silk, offered little in the way of protection from the opponent or the sun's burning rays. In a light two-pieced outfit that exposed the subtle musculature of her slim shoulders and midriff, her feet also in lace-up sandals, her skin was visibly pale to her exposure to the desert, mysteriously and supernaturally resistant to sun and flaw. Tattooed in light blue to her upper right arm was a glypic, tribal design of unknown meaning.\u00a0 \u00a0 Her dainty hands reached across her body for the corresponding hilt of each thin and jewel-encrusted scimitar, eventually flashing the steel she would bear to this match, an appropriately slow and stylish armament for the coming spectacle that may draw the crowd's roar. A dancer and martial artist by hybridized career, Jill snagged her chance at being the first to show off in this grand event, her swords lowering slowly to her sides as she neared him with leisurely steps.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Hi! I'm Jill!\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Her head tilted downwards, a mysterious force overtaking her visage.
