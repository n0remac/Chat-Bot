It formed a large pinching sensation in the pit of her stomach, and beads of sweat began to collect on her upper lip. That usually meant something bad would happen to someone if they chose a particular path. She knew better than to stand in the way of it happening, because warning someone never worked. It didn't stop her from trying, mind, but she knew that the effort would be futile. She caught glimpses of troubled times ahead of the girl. Oh, it was going to happen. She was looking at the future queen of the land, no doubt... But it would not be for very long at all!\u201cI know, child.

Surely the three explained some pleasantries, some introductions, and maybe even experiences on the way. Jill used what conversation had happened to explain in further depth her story of arrival, as Jill's background would most likely come up in cliches between her and Jun and Camilla (\"So where are you from?\").Apparently Jill had come from a tribal people far south in the deserts, where her sister had been sent by the elders on an important mission to save the tribe from some oncoming doom. Having had a bad dream, she then found herself gripped with worry and terror, and slipped out sometime before sunrise to follow in her sister's steps and find her. Jill insisted that her dream was different than others, and felt thoroughly convinced that she was the only one who could save her sister, and perhaps the entire tribe, before the feelings of her dream culminated in a real life, prophesied disaster.There was one well-known passage in and out of the deserts--a single manned bridge outpost over a thin but deep chasm of a ravine, which in theory connected the tribe (which still remains largely isolated by distance, especially following the Cataclysm) with the rest of the known world. Another secretive passage was known to some farther north of the bridge, a pass through the otherwise unbroken cliffs and mesas of red rock that formed a sort of tectonic barrier between northern grasslands and the sandy desert. While just a legend, Jill carefully followed what was theoretically the instructed path to this second exit from the desert. What she found after much climbing was indeed a pass through the cliffs, which descended on the other side almost immediately into dry forest--one in which the dry conifers grew larger and larger and closer together the farther she walked. As night began to fall, mists set in. She kept walking, and at one point looked behind her, and everything she had walked before was gone, replaced by the same kind of scene she saw looking forward--huge tree trunks, a now intense misty shroud, and monotonous terrain that grew glowing mushrooms.Jill then told them (maybe answering some questions and what not, but generally going on with the story as they traveled, provided Camilla and Jun seemed remotely interested) about how she had gotten very scared and hungry after what felt like days, and about how she had eventually eaten half of one of the mushrooms.Strange as the story was now, words could not do the next part justice. She mentioned rather ambiguously how she felt a powerful, strange, energetic intoxication that kept her going, curious, and confused for what must have been another entire day (during which the sun or whatever light was coming through the mist never completely set, further destroying her sense of time), before eventually she found herself too tired, strung out and everything else to keep going. It was here, against a boulder, that she fell asleep.That's where she woke up near Medan's border. If Jun and Camilla didn't have looks of complete disbelief at this point (\"is this girl being serious?\"), she'd quickly cover her brief visit with Stonevale, her encounter with a talking deer and how it directed her \"south\" where Jill ended up near the Scoundrel and the Sage, meeting Jun and and eventually getting threatened by a highwayman.Yeaaaaahhh.........That's exactly what happened.(Sorry for the novel. Winging it-- zero information on the distance or nature of their journey from Stonevale to Usque, but it's a huge block of time that I need to work with.)Eventually, they'd reach the cottage. If this was in a matter of hours, they might show up shortly after hearing and talking about Jill's story. If the journey dragged on for the day(s), they'd find Jill spent most of the silent downtime stoned, as sometime during the walk she had produced a small canvas purse from her tiny waist pack (obvious at this point to be enchanted as a Bag of Holding), and a pipe. She'd take from the bag an extremely pungent herb, put some in the pipe, and smoke it (the pipe magically lighting itself). This would surely launch into another big discussion if they took curiosity to it, as it was a plant that tended to grow in warmer environments and was another indication that Jill was from an entirely different culture.They'd arrive at the cottage... and regardless of how long it took them to arrive, one thing was for certain.Holy gods... she was hungry.Last proper meal?

I was just reuniting with our kin.\" The old woman was familiar enough with the man that she need only nod her head out of respect. Besides, a bow or curtsey was rather hard on her old bones.\"I was just about to speak of the gems... It is time she heard, yes? Well, she should have heard many years ago, but that cannot be helped. Now then...\" --- And regardless of whether people responded or not, the story began It was many centuries before the Cataclysm happened. There was a young mage, Croeria, who was newly crowned the queen of the Usque. Her ruling was just and fair, for she had the greater good in her interests. As a gift to the new queen, a crown was fashioned, a beautiful twining piece that elves had woven out of gold and perfectly carved, pure of clarity gems... These gems had been borne of different magics from the slaying or maiming of some sentient beings. Croeria did not know this when the gift presented, that the sapphire came from the death of a dragon, or that the ruby came from the feather of a phoenix... She did not know that a unicorn's blood had been needed for the emerald or that the diamond came from the eye of the griffon. Of course, the gems had been plucked away from a group of dark elves, for dark elves and high elves were always at war with one another.This crown that held these harvested jewels was powerful and could control the environment around for miles. Seeing that Croeria only used her own power for the greater good of the land, she was entrusted with this power too. She was instructed never to abuse this power, for she would be turned to stone by the elder of the tribe that presented it to her.Croeria did as she was instructed, and used the crown only for keeping the land lush and green in the summers and springs, and never used the fire element unless times called for it. And thus, the Usque forest, all of it, had thrived.There were many who saw the potential of what this power could do... Some were angered that she only harnessed the magic for keeping a forest green and alive. She could do so much more! She could have all the land to herself! Why is she only interested in keeping one section of the world pristine when there could be something greater??The day came that those who wanted more were destroyed inside by their envy. Armies were sent from the different surrounding kingdoms, some driven by the proclamation that Croeria was greedy and didn't want to share her prosperity, others proclaiming that she was intending to use this against them all. As the castle was stormed by one army after another, Croeria was saddened by what was happening. Surely they could see that harnessing the powers incorrectly could cause havoc in the world!So she took the crown from her head, knowing that she could have used against her enemies to win this fight. She handed it to the only person she would ever trust with this item, someone who was fiercely loyal to her, someone who would never and could never harness such power in the manner it was coveted for. Her daughter. \"Take it and go... Run, daughter, for you will be in great danger!\"The daughter did as she was told, only looking back with a solemn nod to her mother, for something told her that this would be the end. The young princess disguised herself as a peasant boy and left through the tunnels, and would not stop until she was well hidden where she knew nobody would find her. It was then that she saw the wisdom in melting the crown down and sending the jewels to different locations on the map in secret.While the daughter was escaping, Croeria moved to stand on the balcony overlooking the fighting men and women. She raised her voice as loud as she could, \"STOP! BE STILL!\" Her voice was barely audible over the agonized screams and clashing of metal, but she said it again until her voice grew hoarse with the yelling. She used all of what she had in her, casting a spell behind the words for the sake of simply attracting the attention of the greed driven armies below. When they all stilled and silenced, one by one, and all turning as if one unit to look at the pale figure high above, she spoke... \"Why are you doing this?\" Her voice, though haggard, was loud and commanding... \"Don't you see what this has done to you? That you want what you should not have and you are seeking to kill for it? You're all too late, I've destroyed the crown.\" And she would toss down the remnants of something else altogether, shards that resembled what used to be gems and lumps of what looked like melted down gold, all made so by illusion. \"No more! It is gone! Now get thee away!\"Anger and disbelief swept through the crowd. How could it be? This fight was all for naught?The sound of a lone bowstring creaked loudly, and kerthunked... It was accompanied by a yell of pure rage, \"YOU BITCH! DEATH BE UNTO YOU!!!\" The single arrow missed, and Croeria fled out of the line of fire...For three days and nights, the battle raged on violently throughout the land, while her daughter slipped further and further away from the madness. She hid in a cave at one point, and pried all the gems from their mountings, desperate to get the deed done before someone knew that she was holding the item. The four gems tinked to the cave floor and she set about building the hottest fire she could, casting the crown itself in so it would melt away. Her journey from there had her burying the gems out of sight.The last gem was sewn into the hem of her skirt, and she fled the main land for parts unknown. Nobody knows what happened from there, only that the young princess disappeared and would never be seen again. As for Croeria, she had died a slow and painful death... First tortured, then drawn and quartered alive. Some say her spirit is still felt in the Usque...\"Though nobody knew for sure what happened to the princess,\" Anid continued quietly, \"She did not die, for her descendants found their way back to the Usque...\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"When you are as old as I am and have been alone for a very long time, things like rabbit stew get perfected.
