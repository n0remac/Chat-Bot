Come out, you got some company!\"  The guard waited until he heard someone walking towards the door and then started to leave.The mayor opened the door and dashed out, closing it shut behind him.

Although I understand you don\u2019t know much with what\u2019s going on up north, I do ask this. Are people vanishing and being found dead up there or is the problem that of a different nature? Of course, if you haven\u2019t been informed of the situation, I understand completely.\u201dAt the question of if they were to continue on now or wait for more assistance, Grandma would turn to the dwarf who was also apparently here for the same reason as she.\u201cI leave the decision to you, friend. I am perfectly fine heading out now, but if you feel waiting for more assistance to be a wise course of action, I shall have no complaints waiting here.
