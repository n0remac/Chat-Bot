Any dogma spread by the junior Immortal is rendered moot. A senior Immortal has shown itself -- the most senior -- and its doctrine is now law.We must begin by the establishment of a power base. This hall is out of the question. It has sunk with age and crumbles. That it remains at all is a mystery. We must build or conquer a new capitol and from there plan our next courses of action. Those courses of action will be conquest.Secondly, we must expand by conquest. Surely this land is entitled to a lord or king. He shall die, and we shall replace him. Our first campaign shall be our most difficult, for we must capture the enemy fortress intact. After this campaign, we may continue on a path as we always have.Iztas looked to Azgori and Vratar. Of the Immortals here, you two have the most to prove. Azgori, I must see the rebirth of the old methods: of the flesh and the earth in particular. Vratar, I expect action to back loyalty, not words. You may have appeased to the mortals, but you did not pander to Morgdun's interest without his disgust. The obsequious I shall deny a kingdom.\u00a0This sort of \"burn\" was met with approval from the gathered Immortals, and even some derisive laughter was channeled to Vratar from the likes of Nahzin and Kariin.Those assembled: do Undying reside within these hallowed halls?\u00a0The Immortals responded by nodding, so Iztas himself nodded and carried out the next step, snapping his fingers. A mental wave spread throughout the halls, and the Undying were called from their coffins, fresh as the day they were interred. Only the greatest, most loyal soldiers became Undying, and it was a privilege from Morgdun to never age, never feel the adverse effects of disease or extreme injury... though they still faced death by the sword. It was the only death Morgdun allowed of them. Brothers, our armies are risen. We now need only retake this kingdom. Are there any among you who yet do not understand what I say?
