The kingdom of Fareen was decimated in the Cataclysm. Only a few vestiges remain including Itteki, an oasis town directly west of the Ao settlement of Fletcher. It has trade routes with two other Old Fareen settlements: Pon Pon Pon and Flyte. It is in between Pon Pon Pon to the north and Flyte to the south. The government of Aozora has not yet discovered this town, so it governs itself. The land of the south is an untamed region full of bandits and monsters, waiting for heroes to reclaim it for the civilized world. Will such heroes make it in time? Or will Itteki also be lost to the post-cataclysm chaos?", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://pm1.narvii.com/5862/ca5cb9aa108457fb96d9c69fd45d6eac923ded40_hq.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://pm1.narvii.com/5862/ca5cb9aa108457fb96d9c69fd45d6eac923ded40_hq.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/><br/></div>"}, "post-62400": {"user": "Aozora", "user_num": 1772, "timestamp": "1491333799000", "message": "The Oasis town has been relatively protected from the destruction of the Cataclysm that destroyed most civilizations over 110 years ago, with it's natural barrier of rocky canyons and cliffs.
