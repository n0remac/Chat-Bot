The war is to the north!\" Both the soldiers on patrol were previously assigned as guards at Stonevale.Only 60 soldiers occupied the camp. Far too few for call an army.

The 40 remaining soldiers were Goraian soldier who had not been sent to New Brimiarde. Many were upset by this and not yet learned the cost of badmouthing their general.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"Can y'believe some mountain bumpkin we've never heard of has been made a general?\" Two soldiers patrolled the perimeter of the camp."}}
