His hair, on the other hand, was as black as coal, alongside the entirety of both eyeballs. One could see nothing in his gaze except and endless void; a void that stared back. \"Get out there!\" A rough-handed man grunted, before shoving him out of the passageway and into the blinding light of day and the roaring screams of tens of thousands of bloodthirsty men and women. He went by the name Flawed, though one could be certain that wasn't his real name. He had been hunted, captured and stripped of all belongings, and now sent out onto the sands of the arena with feet as bare as the rest of his body. Completely nude and without weapon, he was expected to fight against seasoned warriors of the Colosseum in a fight to the death and to glory. There was no valiant speech to address the crowd, or a wishing of good luck to the men about to fight, just a yell of \"BEGIN!\" from the arena master, who threw down an apple core to the sands and then sat back down to tend to his whores. Flawed's chains were unlocked, then the man was released and sent forwards towards his enemy; an armoured man with a trident spear and a full-helm of metal and spiked horns who the crowd affectionately referred to as Vaius. Flawed didn't care about the man's name. The two approached one another in silence, then the battle began. Vaius thrust quickly and firmly at Flawed's chest with his spear. Flawed stepped to the right, then lunged forwards, driving his palm against the face of the gladiator's helm and down into the sand with a thud. Blood began to pool and the crowd went quiet, unsure of what had just occurred. The fight ended as quickly as it had begun and the naked warrior pulled his palm away; a blade of black steel that had violently forced itself out of the warrior's hand sliding out of the skull of his enemy and dripping with blood. Flawed stood straight, watched the arena master, then silently twitched as the blade sank back into flesh that sealed shut behind it.

Within minutes, mercenary soldiers began to drop down from the crowd stands and onto the sand, but as they began progressing towards Flawed, a sharp whistle declared a halt order. Hidden behind a veil, a woman's voice called for the hostilities to cease before they could begin. The crowd, paused and waiting for what was going to happen next, were left disappointed when not so much of a word was spoken. Instead, ladders were lowered from the edge of the pit, the thugs climbed back out, and the arena gate at the far end of the sand opened with a rattle. Since the one behind him was now closed, Flawed silently left through this new gate, unsure what was waiting.
