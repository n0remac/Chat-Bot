Unfortunately for Krynis, the samurai's advance had the very results it had intended to extract from her. A committed reaction was highly likely given what was probably a very adrenal state of mind, and the man had capitalized on that intuition. After all, she had just been suddenly hurled into the side of a very specific mountain and surrounded by guards.When Krynis shoved her sword tip into the ground, considered crudely barbaric by the men who surrounded her, the samurai had been in anticipation for the response he provoked. Krynis committed the entirety of her momentum and even a paranormal multiplying force to a kick that was clearly intended to strike the samurai full force. Instead, as her target leaned and braced rightward coinciding with her sword's motion, her kick would likely meet his sword's edge. The katana was a masterpiece work of steel, its hardened edge tempered and razor sharp. Without her armor, the complete loss of limb was the most likely result. Krynis might instead suffer less permanently, but the force she committed herself to was no grazing matter.With an experienced scheming mind and a lifetime of brutal physical and psychological conditioning, the samurai were masters at arms--the redirection of his freely stanced sword perpendicular to the path of her raising leg happened in a lightning instant, and given the extent of her very momentum, the chance of escape was practically nonexistent.", "link_list": ["/post/5710/thread", "/user/464"], "image_list": ["//storage.proboards.com/6046952/avatar/cGSvbgJhptLNgVT8n7b7.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@krynis\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/5710/thread\" timestamp=\"1437948767\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-464\" title=\"Krynis\"><img alt=\"Krynis Avatar\" src=\"//storage.proboards.com/6046952/avatar/cGSvbgJhptLNgVT8n7b7.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/5710/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1437948767000\" title=\"Jul 26, 2015 14:12:47 GMT -8\">Jul 26, 2015 14:12:47 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-464 group-0\" href=\"/user/464\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@krynis\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Krynis</span></a></span> said:</div>Krynis could tell from the Samurai's stance that he was going to try and throw or otherwise grab her.

Ronotaka's alerted state quickly roused those around him on a mostly subconscious scale, but the true start of it all was when he attempted to grab the samurai's sword.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Numerous kata within the curricula of kenjutsu schools addressed the scenario in which an attacker grabbed at the hilt in an attempt to disarm. Confronted with less of a threat than a wealth of choices, Ronotaka's target opted for a simple one; as Ronotaka reached for the hilt of his katana, the sidearm wakizashi was brandished, it's shorter blade making for a quicker and more effective draw-cut at their proximity. Ronotaka would probably find his unarmored midsection sliced clean open at a diagonal angle by the razor edge of the short sword, which drew much faster than the longer weapon the attacker reached for. Under this scenario, it was highly likely Ronotaka would be dead before the katana ever fully left the sheath.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Assassin!!!\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One of the men yelled out during the attack, though the tight bowstrings of the marksmen's yumi had already begun ringing out.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Apparently, a band of attackers was attempting to scale the cliffs and the walls.

Pursuit against a withdrawal, even so much as a single step, in order to keep the opponent from gaining range was a staple undercurrent of kenjutsu mentality. Without stopping--without thinking--the samurai stepped in whichever direction his opponent did. Ronotaka would find that his step (in whichever step he moved, it is unspecified) would give him little \"wiggle-room\" regardless of its intentions. At this point, the samurai would reach his left hand out and grasp Ronotaka's wrist with an unceremonious jerk, solidifying a barrier to his plan of ever getting the katana unsheathed even if he had managed to step backwards with any beneficial results. The slash with the wakizashi would indeed result in a stab through the heart, should Ronotaka, against all human instinct, continue to resist.\u00a0 \u00a0 The archers continued their rain of arrows on the ascending bandits, eager to wipe them out for good.

However, as the ronin scaled the wall, their command structure became instantly clear. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even the better ronin were likely no match for the samurai, who had a consistent source of sustenance, maintenance, training, and equipment. Furthermore, many of the defenders consisted of Genji's hatamoto, a small unit of elite bodyguards personally selected by the daimyo himself. Fights would seem even at best, brutal at worst, and the attackers would likely find the goal of entering the compound at all to be more and more far-fetched with each passing minute. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The defense of the compound was an oft-drilled concept, a locale which in and of itself was a masterpiece of defensive architecture. A diversion that pulled attention to the main gate would prove less successful than intended, as samurai were well-trained to cover specific sectors as opposed to operating in horde mentality. This, undoubtedly, would expose the smaller and more elite group of attackers to an adequate defense, which consisted of waiting alert warriors wielding primarily polearm weapons. If the attackers were expecting a bunch of unsuspecting backs in a mass at the gate, they'd be sorely mistaken. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for the samurai fighting Ronotaka, the realization of a possession of some sort did indeed freak him, and such was clearly visible in his expression beneath his kabuto helm. While magic existed in Katashima, it's demonstrations were exceedingly rare, resulting in occasional superstitious worldviews. A sense of urgency grew among the spectators--a priestess must come quickly, to ward off the area from demons! The process of getting the local priestess to the scene was treated with the same priority as the rest of the battle and would proceed with order throughout the chaos.", "link_list": ["/post/6628/thread"], "image_list": ["//storage.proboards.com/6046952/images/uCQvKjMwQCSfGa7d4dCT.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@digmase\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/6628/thread\" timestamp=\"1439864275\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-0\" title=\"digmase\"><img alt=\"digmase Avatar\" src=\"//storage.proboards.com/6046952/images/uCQvKjMwQCSfGa7d4dCT.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/6628/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1439864275000\" title=\"Aug 17, 2015 18:17:55 GMT -8\">Aug 17, 2015 18:17:55 GMT -8</abbr></a>  @digmase said:</div>Ronotaka's body was doomed.
