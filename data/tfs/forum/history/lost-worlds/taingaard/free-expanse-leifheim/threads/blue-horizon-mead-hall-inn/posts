He watched the half-giant amble toward the bar after indicating the chairs and table he meant for them to lounge in. Lucolve peered around the mead hall through delicate spectacles perched on his nose. The mead hall was dark and rough, appearing to have been rebuilt whenever repairs are needed. The tables and chairs did not match throughout the hall, indicating they were either frequently replaced, or collected piecemeal, Lucolve suspected the former. A few patrons were scattered throughout the hall, drinking from horns and cups which also did not quite match each other. The dishes of food were varied throughout the hall as there were legs of lamb, sides of beef, whole rabbits and squirrels, and even some roast pig. Bowls of stew boasted vegetables swimming with chunks of meat. Lucolve was not a heavy drinker, but for the sake of building rapport with the giant and gaining knowledge, he would call upon every element he could to ensure he held his own. Seating himself in the chair, Lucolve ensured the door could be observed easily. Setting his travel desk underneath the table, he pulled a rough cut crystal from one of the side compartments. This crystal was not clear, and certainly not smooth, like the last. Roughly cut sides revealed cracks and flaws, clouded clarity, and uneven surfaces. Holding the crystal to the light of the fire, Lucolve breathed in slowly, willing the warm glow to fill the crystal and spread a red light. The crystal felt warm in his hand as Lucolve placed it on the table to add a little more light to the parchment he laid upon the tabletop. Tonight would be a long night, but he was glad to finally be seated in a chair without the constant lulling rock of the seas beneath him.

The food here in Taingaard was quite hard to describe as 'tasty' as in a plate of finely spiced food, this wasn't the right way to put it. Rather it was obvious that the land and its inherent vigor added some of this vitality to it's inhabitants through the food whether it be animal or vegetable. In fact many tourists in Taingaard would speak of how the meat would be almost too intense in its natural flavor the first time they ate it and how freshness did not cover it when they tasted the berries. The same was the case with the beer which in would be tasted, experienced and lived in a way quite resembling that of taking the first full breath of mountain air when coming from the city. Only these breaths would make you quite drunk if you took too many.\"To The Bryn! Our local Brynjefors Ale and the first thing most visitors here drink and... the last thing many of us tastes before waking up the day after!\" Brunn said and laughed as he raised the mug for a toast. \"So Lucolve...\" Brunn said and sunk his teeth into a rabbit leg. \"Where do you hail from?\" he asked curiously.

The flavor hit him without warning, hints of oak and earth drawing his breath away. This had only happened to him once before, on the peak of a mountain where the air was slightly too thin to fully breathe. \"Brunn, my good man, now that is a tale to tell!\" Lucolve said, placing his ale on the table. His ink-stained hands grasped the frail spectacles from his nose, squirreling them away within the robes once more. \"I originally was born in a land known as the Isran Empire. My people are known as the Celadine.\" Lucolve paused, reaching for one of the bowls of stew. He gently scooped a spoonful of the steaming dish into his mouth as he studied Brunn's face. Many people had heard of the Celadine Tribe, and the powers they wield. \"I would not be surprised if that name rings a bell, even here in Taingaard. Jun is known far and wide throughout the lands for her heroic deeds. Known and feared.\" Lucolve took another strong swallow of the ale, savoring the tones his tongue tasted. The earthy undertones reminded him of his childhood, learning to farm, cultivate, and nurture the earth. \"I was not always raised by the Celadine, however.\" He stated, a tone of interest on his tongue, a grin upon his face. \"I showed promise in the elemental magic of my people, and was sent to be tutored in the arts. My talents were limited, however, and I soon found that my skills were better put to use in the pursuit of knowledge. I left my homeland and became apprenticed under a traveling soldier turned scholar.\"Lucolve pulled the meat from the bone with his teeth as he paused to take advantage of the meal. For the past few weeks, he had been surviving on solely hard tack and traveling rations. \"I learned much in my travels, and would like to build a library one day, which spans the governments and regions of this world. Taingaard is one of the regions I knew very little about, so here I am, before you.\" Lucolve slumped back into the chair, ale in hand, and glanced at the fire.

Brunn nodded as Lucolve told him about the Isran Empire which he of course knew about as a decent amount of visitors hailed from Isra. \"Hmm... I think I had a young woman here not many days ago from Isra. What was her name? I remember she was very cold and helped me trying to find my sniffer dog. Her name waaas...\" he said and scratched his chin. \"Oh I remember! Fetcher! That was it, Roseanne Fetcher!\" he said and enthusiastically slapped the table. \"You know her?\" he asked Lucolve. \"But Celadine... I haven't heard about that name before although I know that your nation applaud their heroes almost more than we do. I can only imagine that this Jun is a mighty hero.\" he said and raised his mug again. \"For the Celadine!\" he said and took another large gulp of his ale. It was as much an excuse to take another sip as it was to be polite and honor those heroes he had not yet met. Brunn couldn't be called a scholar but he did enjoy the occasional book - especially the ones about Taingaardian history - and if it was fictionalized slightly that just eased it for the half giant. But they didn't have many libraries in Brynjefors Harbor and thus he had to be content with whatever the travelling merchant could sell him.\"Building a library is no small task. I've heard tales about the one they have in Vikhafen our capital - it is said to be impressive, but not everyone gets to enter the old part of the library.\" Brunn said and looked at Lucolve. \"What kind of books would be in this library of yours?

Lucolve frowned a little hearing him mentioning the arcane. \"Ooh yes... the arcane.\" he said and leaned back in the chair as it creaked beneath his mighty weight looking as if he was musing before he leaned towards Lucolve again. \"There are some who practice magic inside Taingaard and the art of the rune craft may interest you... They are in Leifheim a little further north but...\" he said and weighed his words again before lowering his voice. \"I'm probably a bad guide for saying this as it might lead to danger... but the druids of Gr\u00f6nskog are something you would want to look into too then.

So many stories had told about how dangerous it was to enter Gr\u00f6nskog but then again some of his more trusted friends had told of kindness from the Gr\u00f6nskog druids that roamed Taingaard outside of Gr\u00f6nskog itself.
