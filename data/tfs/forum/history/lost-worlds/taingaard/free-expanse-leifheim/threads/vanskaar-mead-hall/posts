Kord, the latest owner of his family establishment, was cleaning a few mugs at the bar before the long and busy work day would soon commence when the sun climbed the last bit above the horizon. The Meadhall needed a steady supply of meat and fruits from the hunters and gatherers that worked for the Meadhall and today was no exception. However a large wedding was taking place here in a few days between two Skulh\u00f8y clans, and they had requested bear - not a request for just about any hunter. \"Ahh there you are \u00c1sta, it's been a few days! Did you find yourself lost in a thicket?\" he joked though knowing how serious \u00c1sta was with her hunting she had probably stalked her prey for days though the wild. \"I get it that since you're here though you don't mind going for another trip huh?\" he asked with a wry smile, his thick mustache curling upwards underlining his rugged, warm charm.

Her boots thudded across the floor as she came near the closest table between Kord and herself, hoisting off the load from her shoulders and letting the heavy body of a killed lynx slam on the surface - very little blood to the lovely pelt, and dead from a hard bludgeoning to the neck to kill it quick.

The competition, mister Konstantine!\" Kord would say sternly his iron grip only soft in relation to his even harder stare. \"No more missteps from you or there will only be one way from here...\" he said determinedly as he towered even above Dietrich only letting go if he knew the guy to comply completely. He might have to discuss with the tains to deduct points from this guy already before The Hunt had started.

Kord suddenly opened his eyes wide when the Tawakoshi party entered. They had been invited before, but the shogun had always declined their offer and thus this was the first time he had seen the recluse Tawakoshi warriors and it was a sight to been and Kord gave a wry smile as one of them approached. He was a severe man as it seemed and Kord instinctively tightened up a bit himself. \"Well I bid you welcome, Seijo Ito of Tawakoshi. May luck follow you!\" he said as they took care of the formalities - or that he thought. Just as Kord believed he had figured out their culture and was acting appropriately, this other... ehrm... 'guy' turned up. Or at least Kord believed him to be one despite his acting. \"Ah... ahhh welcome mister Taro!\" he said and smiled, handing Taro the registration papers to sign. \"I think 'the wind' is not bad weapon for The Great Hunt, although if you end up in the mountains, the wind might be against you.\" Kord commented with a short chuckle. He did not doubt Seijo was a warrior of heart, but this Taro guy seemed a little inexperienced in his mind. \"May the luck be in your favor too!\" Kord said to Taro. The next registrant was a huge man that even Kord literally had to look up to. He had made quite an entrance but Taingaard and Vanskaar Mead Hall were prepared for the giants and half giants that lived throughout Taingaard in settlements and often liked to drop by. So both the gate and ceiling were scaled to someone a few feet taller than the regular man and they had chairs for his like too. \"Welcome Altan to Taingaard, we are honored that the Khan would send such a mighty warrior to participate in The Great Hunt.\" Kord said Altan's reputation preceding him. \"I will fit you into another group and I wish you the best of luck.\" Kord said and nodded at the huge warrior. It seemed brute muscle wouldn't be in short supply this time as another tall warrior made his entrance. People seemed to be at unease around him as he stared a lot at people, but Kord knew that some warriors were like this and if he could direct that intent towards the monsters that roamed the land he would be fine. \"Kinzokan the Black it is...\" Kord said and wrote his alias. \"Stabbing with a spear is no bad tactic!\" Kord said and chuckled and was not very surprised to hear that this guy had killed such a for as a giant. \"I trust that you'll get along fine among others, just direct that energy towards the enemy, right?\" Kord said and smirked although he noted that Altan and Kinzokan might not be the best to throw together in a team.
