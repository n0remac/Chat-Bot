However these woods are also the home of the Gr\u00f6nskog Druids, powerful nature magic practitioners and although they are not considered hostile as such, one should not set foot in Gr\u00f6nskog lightly - you may not see them, but they surely see see you and will either accept you or show you the way out.\u00a0For those allowed to venture further into the forest, you might eventually after a few days journey arrive at Migand, the city of the Gr\u00f6nskog Druids. When the druids came to Taingaard and almost unnoticed settled in Gr\u00f6nskog, they build this city in the woods and claimed the forest theirs more than 500 years ago.\u00a0", "link_list": ["https://flic.kr/p/27YaT2h", "https://flic.kr/p/27YaT2h", "https://www.flickr.com/photos/137813549@N06/", "https://flic.kr/p/LVQ5w7", "https://flic.kr/p/LVQ5w7", "https://www.flickr.com/photos/137813549@N06/"], "image_list": ["https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1823/42642484574_578756638a_b.jpg", "https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1783/29488852658_8652a16bd5_b.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/27YaT2h\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1823/42642484574_578756638a_b.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/></a><a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/27YaT2h\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/137813549@N06/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div>"}}
