Lashed around his waist (with what appeared to be homemade cordage) was an obviously aged and well used ogre-sized wooden club, and he carried in his left hand a large rock - the rock a bit larger than an average human's head. The ogre was a strange mix of understated Tawakoshi finery, and obvious brutish underpinnings.Wuppo listened, or at least tried to, as Erik spoke, but only hearing his own name would bring his attention fully back to the man. His mind tended to wander when not given a specific goal-oriented task, and even then he was prone to wandering off if that task didn't move along in a way that kept him on track. Wuppo's mind at that moment was focused on Seijo, and more specifically his female companion. Wuppo was dense at times, that was fair enough criticism, but even the ogre would have picked up on the fact that Seijo did not appreciate his company - which to Wuppo seemed about normal for a human from Tawakoshi. This had kept Wuppo from interacting with Seijo very much on the trip over from Tawakoshi, but now he looked at the woman with him. The woman appeared to be from Tawakoshi, wearing a kimono which Wuppo was familiar with and which also set her apart from the very differently dressed denizens of Taingaard. This would be easily explained, except for one point; Wuppo was absolutely certain he'd never seen her before just. How did a woman from Tawakoshi get all the way across the ocean with the party, without Wuppo ever having seen her?Wuppo moved through the crowd, most of which he found to not be tightly bunched up and easy enough for him to get through, and over to Seijo and his female accompanier. Wuppo squinted, standing a few strides away from them. He bent his upper body downwards toward the pair, and smelled the air around them. Something wasn't right here, and Wuppo didn't possess the manners and level of social awareness it would take for a normal person not to mention it.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "As Wuppo stood in the courtyard of the Tain's domicile, he appeared to be a walking contradiction.

Maybe this team will decide to take on the mighty challenge it is to hunt down the old warg Baedor?\" Erik asked rhetorically.\u00a0\"Team two will head for Sentient Springs, a damp area in the southern part of Thornwood, where the darkness seems to attract more than enough foul beings for you to pick.\" he said and nodded towards them.\u00a0\"Team three will be departing for Kharg's Stomping Grounds in \u00d8stfold! We know of a legendary creature there named... Kharg...\" Erik said to let it seep in and continued. \"Who is a beast of great physical might being half giant and half mammoth. Best of luck, if you choose to go for this one!\" Erik said and smiled wryly. \"Team four will visit Mistylight Swamp close to Vildmose, where the trees, plants and animals are all affected by twisted magic and little is known by its natural inhabitants.\" he said with a slightly concerned look to his face.\"Team five will locate The Glade of Origins, and ancient hollowed out ice cave, where it is said that an old evil is lurking, a frosty and old creature from past times that few would approach.
