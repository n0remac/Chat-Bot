In winter you'll find that the warm hearth and furs make for a great place to catch your warmth and in the summer the temperate climate makes walking the streets, smelling the food and experiencing the ancient and charming culture of Leifheim ever so fascinating. Shops will sell you anything you need and the Leifheim market is one of the best places to find food and ingredients for alchemy and shamanism.\u00a0The Inner City also connects to the Tain's house however this place is restricted for those without permission. But if you are a curious traveler or adventurer, you may want to go visit the rune forges where you might even get your dull old blade inscribed with the old runic magic if you have the cash for it.\u00a0", "link_list": ["https://flic.kr/p/298mEy5", "https://flic.kr/p/298mEy5", "https://www.flickr.com/photos/137813549@N06/"], "image_list": ["https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1782/43402794092_29bf34d477_o.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/298mEy5\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1782/43402794092_29bf34d477_o.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/></a><a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/298mEy5\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/137813549@N06/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div>"}}
