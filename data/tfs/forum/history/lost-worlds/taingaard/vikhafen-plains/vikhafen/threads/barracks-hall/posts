AFRAID! Heavenly Horses damn all these heathens to the pits of the deepest hole in existence! He wasn't afraid! He was humiliated and infuriated! And the only damned thing keeping him from running off again was this wench still being near him, and if he was understanding these fools correctly, he would have to deal with her more! He snorted his objections quite clearly, and attempted to pull hard on the reins to at least put some distance between himself and this crazy girl."}, "post-91116": {"user": "Adyn Foster", "user_num": 3382, "timestamp": "1560123608000", "message": "Adyn's eyes kept going back to Karl, observing him but she tried her best to focus on what he was saying.

Her mother had always said she had the luck of at least three faeries with her, and it was times like these where she wondered if her mother had really made some deal with the fae for her life. Working in a noble's stables? Even at a low level? It suited her just fine. She gave the Tain a wider smile and inclined her head towards him. \"I beg yer pardon for how casual I've been talking to ya then. Country folk tend to be at a bit of a loss 'cept with horses.\" She offered by way of apology. \"I am regrettably not a citizen here, but I've come across the waters from Isra to strike out on my own from ma family. I'd very much like to work for ya sir and I don't mind much what level it's at so long as I get to work with these beauties here.\" She said with a bright smile, scratching under Karl's chin.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Adyn's eyes kept going back to Karl, observing him but she tried her best to focus on what he was saying.

If you believe yourself to feel home in the countryside, I'm quite certain Taingaard is for you. Even our cities have a homely feel to them and we don't fuss too much about the small details.\" Erik said proudly. \"How about as your first task you bring this steed over to its friends and make sure its comfortable in the stables?\" Erik proposed. \"Then I will...\" Erik said starting to feel his headache again - and on top of that he was sore too now. \"I will retreat for other duties.\" he nodded and smiled looking forward to hitting the bed again. \"We will see each other again, Mister Mindaugas!\" he said and turned also to Adyn. \"And I'm sure once you have this guy saddled...\" Erik padded the horse. \"I can try and ride him with more success again.\" the tain grinned and bid them farewell before retreating again.
