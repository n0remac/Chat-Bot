In the central part of Vikhafen inns, mead halls, shops, markets, stalls, entertainment and art is abundant. This part of the city never fully sleeps and from the small back alleys to the large, wide streets Central is a place where you'd get lost even if you lived there all your life.\u00a0Central Vikhafen will connect you to the High Arch where the Tain lives with his family, guards and servants as well as the main gates, though Central Vikhafen faces the opposite direction of the docks requiring quite a journey through the city to reach the water ways.\u00a0The architecture is relatively advanced compared to Leifheim with basements, multi storied buildings and a generally finer craftsmanship with the stone walls and crafting of the lumber for the buildings as well as ornamentation. However the houses are more compact and stand closer to each other giving a feeling of a city that to a larger extend feel intimate when walking the most busy quarters.\u00a0", "link_list": ["https://flic.kr/p/298oKjJ", "https://flic.kr/p/298oKjJ", "https://www.flickr.com/photos/137813549@N06/"], "image_list": ["https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1827/43403200362_3da5ccd517_o.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/298oKjJ\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1827/43403200362_3da5ccd517_o.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/></a><a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/298oKjJ\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/137813549@N06/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div>"}}
