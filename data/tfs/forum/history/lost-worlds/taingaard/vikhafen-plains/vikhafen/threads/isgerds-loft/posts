The sloped walls are decorated with interesting nick-nacks that Isgerd has found \u2013 feathers, stones, icons of long forgotten gods, musical instruments and decorated arrow-heads. A stone game board lies somewhere underfoot that may trip the unwary. The \u201chorns\u201d on the outside the building make an excellent perch for a bird.

The candlelight glinted in her eyes. \u201cSo, I'll teach you a little, just so you know. Wayfinding is a kind of focused thought. You might say magic, if you wish. When I concentrate, I can 'see' a trail of bright light, that shows me the best way to reach a place, person or thing.

One hand placed on the frame as he entered it graced the top in order to judge the rest of the room as he passed through. Once established he bent slightly. Stooping was not his favorite past time but at times was necessary. His gaze remained upon Isgerd\u2019s face as she turned inviting him to sit alongside her. He did not hesitate to do so crossing the room rather awkwardly with his bent back and long legs but once he was seated he spread them allowing his elbows to rest on his thighs as he leaned slightly forward to look and observe the girl, and the room. Cozy one might have called it, and he enjoyed the sort of insight into her world. It seemed she did not require much in terms of space but collected much in terms of oddities. He saw a few feathers that he recognized but he did not have long to wonder at her small marvels as she herself was beside him and speaking. His knee gently bumped her thigh and he moved his right arm, for he sat seated on her left, bringing it back behind him in order to prop him slightly as he watched. He understood what she spoke of in a sense but it was only imagined in his mind and for some reason it was a sparkling gold light in color like fairy dust. It amused him to think that was what they would follow and a slow languid smile came to his face, \u201cI see the concept,\u201d he informed her when she finished. There was a simple enjoyment in hearing her speak for her voice had been soothing. It had been some time since he had heard of such concepts much less spoke of by a woman of Vikhafen.

When she sprinkled them upon the fire a smell of incense arose strongly and sparks of different colours rose briefly with the flames.

It was not such a long period of meditation, since the object in question was known to her, the location near. When her eyes snapped open at last, they seemed brighter, clearer somehow. She got to her feet in one smooth motion, stepped directly over the fire to Rutgard and pointed her finger directly to where the jade bead lay in the pocket of his trousers. She flattened her hand over it, feeling its familiar form underneath the leather. She smiled up at him knowingly. \u201cWhat a place to choose. Shall I reach in and get it, or would you like to?\u201d \u201cNow, that was easy. It was my bead, after all. I know it well. See if you can hide something that belongs to you.
