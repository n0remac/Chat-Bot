I apprenticed under an old graybeard - a giant - that had made a reputation for himself as a master blacksmith. He told me I would be drawing ingots into billets for him, and that if I needed tongs for the task, I would have to make them. I'd already had some small amount of experience - which of course I believed to be more than it was - and hammered out a pair of tongs in only a few minutes.

You will first learn to make a pair of tongs'.\" Alrik let out a quick huff of a laugh at the memory. He hadn't thought of his beginnings in smithing in quite some time. \"I made dozens of pairs of tongs. Racks of them. Over and over for weeks - but none of them were ever satisfactory. I had a lesson to learn before I was finally able to grasp the task set before me, and begin learning in earnest.\"The giant sitting in the middle of Laina's forge spoke slowly, and told the story as if the pair of them were old friends sitting around the hearth after dinner.
