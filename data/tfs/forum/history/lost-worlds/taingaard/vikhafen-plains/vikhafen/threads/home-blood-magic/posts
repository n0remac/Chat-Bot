Witches were trouble, almost as much as Fae themselves.When the witch mentioned the child, Roxanne froze. A child, a human child. Fae stole children, snatched them from cradles and left little turnip dolls in their place. Did this witch really expect her to simply bring them one? She couldn't do that, that was inhumane. Granny would have her hide if she heard about Roxanne delivering children to fairies. Of course, Granny would have her hide if she knew about a lot of things Roxanne did, but this was different.\"A child?\" she repeated, incredulous. \"What do you mean, a child? How does a child belong to the fae? Did they steal the poor thing, only to have it rescued? Explain yourself. I won't give them a human child, that's not right. That's not what you're supposed to do!\"Besides, she thought, it sounded as though the witch had her own plans for this transaction.
