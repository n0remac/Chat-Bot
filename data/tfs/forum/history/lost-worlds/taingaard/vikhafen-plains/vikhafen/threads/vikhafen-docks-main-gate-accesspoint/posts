At the gates!\" he called out, his voice booming up from his chest as he was still a few dozen meters away. The guards would have obviously spotted him by now anyway, but Alrik decided to do them the courtesy of announcing himself. He waited until he was a bit closer before addressing the guards. \"I am Alrik Storkin,\" he began, his voice now much more quiet and a smooth baritone, \"I am homesteading to the west, and come to purchase some essentials for the home I am building.\" he patted the large leather bag that hung around his neck and draped over to his left side. \"My bag is empty, I seek to fill it with supplies.\"His words were simple, and right to the point.
