Travelers and hunters must be aware of puddles that are really pitfalls, swamp like conditions and areas that are as quicksand. The trees here doesn't grow as close as deeper within Thornwood but in some places a close fog will fall upon the area every once in a while.\u00a0", "link_list": ["https://flic.kr/p/23Dmf7i", "https://flic.kr/p/23Dmf7i", "https://www.flickr.com/photos/137813549@N06/"], "image_list": ["https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7855/39804066133_c605b9b2df_o.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/23Dmf7i\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7855/39804066133_c605b9b2df_o.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/></a><a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/23Dmf7i\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/137813549@N06/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div>"}, "post-92988": {"user": "Tala", "user_num": 3558, "timestamp": "1565313123000", "message": "The rain trickling from the canopy flooded the ground in isolated streams and showered Tala the Silent, but the cloak protected the water from soaking her through to the bone.

Steel-blue eyes darted to her companion who was nestled in a tree and was gesturing ahead at the target. Tala moved from behind the tree as she drew an arrow, anchored the bow, held her breath as she watched the reindeer munch on a couple of leaves, and released. It never saw it coming. Her companion said something, but it was muffled in her head from the focus and thrill of the hunt.\u00a0After recovering the arrow, she carried the fallen creature back to camp on her shoulders; the party had already set up some tents and a fire. Someone cheered as the hunters entered, remarked that perhaps it was a good idea to bring along an actual hunter, and had she ever hunted a troll before? They did not know how long it would take to stake out the monsters, but did not waste any time on settling down to make the best of the situation; not all of them were as accustomed to the chilled climate as Tala was, and that was putting it mildly.\u00a0Tala settled down on a log dragged in from the forest, her job done. As the others chatted around the campfire, she noticed it had stopped raining, and popped open a book.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The rain trickling from the canopy flooded the ground in isolated streams and showered Tala the Silent, but the cloak protected the water from soaking her through to the bone.
