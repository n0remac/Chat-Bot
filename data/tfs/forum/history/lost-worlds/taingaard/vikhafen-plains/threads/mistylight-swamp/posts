While his people prized martial prowess they had a healthy respect for shamans and the display of magic certainly put the man in such territory. Rather than immediately taking off again the big man pauses, resting the shaft of his glaive on his shoulder as he strokes his chin.

A few animals crossed their paths but the mammals here seemed oddly besides themselves - an elk might trip over a stick or a squirrel might blindly walk over the edge of a branch and fall down into the thicket.
