Arenna's last comment passed with no answer - why would did she think he wanted to peek at some school girl dipping her toes in the water? If she found any, which he doubted. Atraedor went a little out of her reach and started setting up some very rudimentary traps that were perhaps unlikely to yield much, but at least he wanted to give it a try. And if she actually found a creek, they might be better off trying to catch a few fish. However close by Arenna would be lucky enough to find a creek which had a depth that would reach to her navel and flow calmly through the woods - despite being slightly cold, it was fresh and entirely clear. A few fish swam in the creek but nothing to disturb a good bath. Meanwhile Atraedor was circling the perimeter having sharpened a fitting branch to use as a spear.
