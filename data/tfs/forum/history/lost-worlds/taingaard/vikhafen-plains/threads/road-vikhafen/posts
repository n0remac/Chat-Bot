Or perhaps that was just her hazel eyes gleaming beneath the sunshine as she pinned her offended look on Atraedor.\"My posture is perfect,\" she argued back, tossing her head so her dark hair fell onto her back instead of over her shoulders. \"I would last much longer than you in a saddle, I guarantee it.\"Her steed huffed then, as if agreeing with her point. \"And besides, I don't want to talk about where I hail from. I want to talk about how a man could be in the business of selling horses without knowing a thing about them.\"Apparently, the feisty and haughty young woman still hadn't figured out the obvious signs of who Atraedor might be. Clearly the young woman wasn't stupid, but she was obviously very inexperienced with the rabble of the world.She watched as they parted onto a tougher more lumpy road, and her first through was for the horse's hooves, while the second noticed that for a road leading to some city, it certainly wasn't well traveled.Again that unease of her situation crawled s little further up Arenna's back as she glanced around, and then back at Atraedor. Perhaps she should bolt. She was absolutely confident in her skills in horsemanship, and she could use a little magic to stop his own steed...No, no, everything was fine.

She could only imagine her mother's hardstare, and Analucia-- the real Analucia's-- disapproving slap on her hand for the way she'd been acting. Rafael, of course, would have been amused at the situation but likely would have talked to her about it later. She'd once again managed to put her foot in her mouth, and in a nervous gesture, bit into the lush flesh of her bottom lip.\"Well, I...\" She began and then didn't know how to continue, so she cleared her throat.Once.Twice.Then...\"I'm sorry. You are helping me. I should be kinder. I will be kinder,\" she informed Atraedor with a dollop of earnestness in her voice. It was a little harder to look at him so she turned her eyes onto a landscape. Although initially she'd been taken in with the vista, a plain was a plain and there was only so much plain one could look at.\"So... why did you need a second rider?\" Arenna asked, with a tone like she was making conversation only and was still not putting the pieces together. Her hazel eyes, framed in thick lashes, were once again on him. \"Trained horses usually follow where they're led.

He needed a second rider to ride the second horse of course. And also to appear a little less like a horse thief as in Taingaard you didn't see many people like him herding horses. \"Th... they do..?!?\" it slipped from his tongue. \"Yes... YES of course they do, I know that!\" a few drops of sweat making their way down his forehead. \"I needed one extra becaaause... If the horse is spooked by something, it won't try to run away!\" he lied - but he considered it a good enough lie. Hopefully, because this girl might be na\u00efve but she was surprisingly sharp in areas she knew something about. Slowly they would be approaching a city it seemed and Analucia would be able to see water on her right and a great big wall of murky green forest to her left as long as she could see.\"It seems like we're here... The great city of Sv... Ehrm... Vikhafen!\" Atraedor said with a nervous grin. Even before they entered it was nowhere near the size of a capital city and the chaos of smoke, voices and activity was prevalent in the distance. \"It's... very roomy inside walls!\" Atraedor said and hoped that since she knew no other cities in Taingaard she would never notice.Exit [Svarthafen]", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/3503/svarthafen"], "image_list": [], "html": "Expecting more flaming from the slender and fiery woman of unknown origin Atraedor briefly made big eyes when she actually apologized.
