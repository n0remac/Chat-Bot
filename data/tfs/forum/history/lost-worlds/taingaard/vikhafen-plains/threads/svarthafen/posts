She was absolutely ruining everything, but if he didn't do something she wouldn't reach the fae before she would have been immolated her also and Atraedor focused all his mental energy.

His people had a special ability to absorb energy - heat, motion and the likes could be stored in their bodies, but Atraedor was the only one who could absorb so quickly and release it all at once. It was a long, long time since he had done it last time though.\"But yeah, I'm kinda sorry I dragged you into this since you're not from Taingaard.\" Atraedor said, his apology based on the fact that he believed she had scolded him. Rolling his shoulders and slapping his cheeks a couple of times he felt a lot more present and the scarlet red of his body had changed to something of a dim purple and the smoking had stopped, his skin surprisingly untouched by the fire he had been exposed to before, only a few patches looking painful still. \"We have to go though - and not back through the city. I'm sure the bitch is sufficiently angry now and sends her men after us. This forest isn't safe either, but we have no choice - and then I promise you, we'll head for Vikhafen.\" Atraedor said and started trotting through the undergrowth fully expecting Arenna to understand the severity of the situation much better this time, and follow closely behind him. \"You really thought, you could pummel her though?\" he asked with a wry smile, though he admired her guts and courage in trying to do so. Maybe not so much her intellect just then, but to be brave one had to turn off the mind sometimes. Only problem was, that to be stupid, you had to do the same thing - and the line was thing indeed.

If the men weren't going to come after them for attacking the Black Tain, she was fairly sure that they'd come after them for the ransom she would bring to a country currently going through a Golden Age and bursting with wealth to spend. Queen Xiomara was financing \"explorers\" and \"privateers\" left and right to expand Rondon's land, now that Zephyr had been soundly conquered and all their riches reaped.... But then, they were already running from the men, weren't they? Perhaps telling Atraedor who she was would just needlessly stress him. Yes, that was the better option, wasn't it...?As Arenna continued to followed, she was uncharacteristically quiet... but at least she wasn't panicking at the thought of being in dangerous woods, or not being in a hotel room or having eaten.
