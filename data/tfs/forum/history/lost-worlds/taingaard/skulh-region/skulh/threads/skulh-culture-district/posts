This district also connects to most inns and mead halls in the city and basically accommodates whatever a traveler or adventurer could wish for in stores and market stalls and you'll find horses and boars for riding along with almost any conceivable service. On days with blue sky this outer part of the city is quite the fetching sight with the glistering grey walls and you'll understand why the more wealthy people of Taingaard often has a home in the upper parts of the district, where the view is marvelous and the air is as fresh as it comes.\u00a0", "link_list": ["https://flic.kr/p/Kw4d3e"], "image_list": ["https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1805/28563461737_7606f4edee_b.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/Kw4d3e\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1805/28563461737_7606f4edee_b.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/></a></div>"}}
