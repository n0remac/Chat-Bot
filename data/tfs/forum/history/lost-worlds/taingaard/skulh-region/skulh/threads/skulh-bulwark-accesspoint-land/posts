Frosty it was not, but neither was it a warm spring in Isra - and certainly not today. As Roxanne approached the massive gates to Skulh\u00f8y she would hear a load roar as the gates went up and the sound of hooves on the ground would be heard as a dozen soldiers rode out on horses with their captain leading the charge on an armored grizzly bear. The soldiers wouldn't notice Roxanne until the last moment where the captain pulled his reins and avoided riding right through her. However the captain quickly circled around and and signaled his soldiers to follow him as he slowly approached Roxanne though his lieutenant seemed not to understand why they would make a halt since they were in such a hurry. \"Who... Are you?\" he asked firmly and frowned removing the helmet for a moment revealing a young but scared face with shoulder long brown hair and a build that might in someway having you think about dwarves, though he was about as tall as Roxanne. \"The city is closed for tourists right now with the crisis going on, you should head back where you came from... unless you have been summoned?\" he spoke quickly.

But lately they've seemed to come down the mountains and out of their swamps and caves seeking food in the nearby villages. First it was sheep, cows and chickens, but larger groups have threatened the peace and we fear that one of the outer most villages, Salrod, might have suffered even worse. We had a runner down here earlier today that told of hordes of creatures attacking the village in the night. Frankly we fear the worst.\" he said and turned his head back towards Roxanne who's coat might have been suffering even more from the branches that ripped into it as the roads here were neither paved nor prepared for this kind of rushed travel. \"Are you still with me back there?\" he asked with a grin as the bear rushed through the woods with his men chasing it. \"By the way I'm Korli! What was your name again?\" he asked as he seemed to be perfectly able to balance both the act of controlling the bear and doing meaningful conversation with Roxanne at the same time. \"Also that fur coat looks far too fragile to have been from Taingaard origin - from where do you hail?\" ", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"You haven't heard of it?

There is a reason while I'm riding ol' husky here.\" he said his smile turning wry. \"No the beasts and monsters are far more vile. Some quite intelligent while others are more like the force of nature - I hope you're a seasoned monster hunter.\" he said with a bit of humor to his voice. \"Unfortunately we don't yet know who these bastards are, but we're going to find out.\" he said decisively. \"If you're still hanging on, grab even tighter!\" he warned her as the bear suddenly starting running even faster through the woods hoping Roxanne could handle such a beast between her legs. Korli listened to Roxanne but as they raced through the woods he had no longer much mental room for answering her questions immediately. 'So many questions, who would expect me to answer all those right now?' he thought with a faint grin. A little while later however Korli raised his hand and they made pause in a small clearing and the bear lay down on the stomach allowing Korli and Roxanne to dismount. \"He just needs a short while to relax and now that we're getting closer to the village it's best to give him a bit of time to read the scent in the air also. If there are any after us or in front of us he'll tell us.\" Korli said and padded the large brown bear on the shoulder as it made a baritone grunt. \"I did listen to what you asked and I'll answer you now. This bear is indeed one I've tamed myself, and if you said you're from Asgeir and lived in Isra you wouldn't know that it was old Taingaard tradition for us living in Skulh\u00f8y to tame wild bears and ride to war in them - but I'm the first in more than a hundred years to take up the tradition.\" he said with some pride to his voice. \"To why I believe I've already told you - he's quite handy in a battle. Aren't there anyone in Isra that trains wild beasts or befriends them?\" Korli asked slightly surprised. \"You need something to eat?\" he suddenly asked thinking she had traveled far and had had no rest before she was picked up and tossed into battle.

I'm sure I'll be able to help, it definitely sounds interesting.\"Once they stopped,Roxanne hopped off and watched the beast sniff the air as she stretched out her sore muscles. She'd always known that bears had keen noses, but she'd only ever seen them used to find berries and honey trees. Who would have thought that one could be trained to detect monsters? It was like a dog, a much larger and stronger dog that could be ridden. For a moment, Roxanne almost wished she had a bear of her own...until she thought about how much it would cost to feed such a creature.\"That's incredible that you were able to tame him,\" she said. \"It's quite a feat. How did you learn to do it? Did you figure it out on your own, or did you look over ancient texts? I can tell how he'd be useful. People in Isra train animals too, but they're usually much smaller. Horses, dogs, geese, pigeons, beetles...you know, ordinary things.\"She accepted the bag of jerky gratefully and took a bite, nearly cracking a tooth. It was incredibly hard and dry, perhaps some of the hardest meat she'd ever had in her mouth. Did Taingaardians just have stronger teeth than she did? Regardless, she was still hungry, and took to chewing the jerky very slowly and carefully until it softened up.

The bear has to feel comfortable around you and the first thing you'll do is to make physical contact with it so it will get to know you and you will get to know it.\" he said and turned towards the bear that was now resting on its stomach and snorting slightly. \"It's not so different as with dogs or cats actually - just don't show it that you're afraid or it will think that you're prey.\" he said and sat down in front of it stroking it's nose waving Roxanne close to him. \"Now you try it.
