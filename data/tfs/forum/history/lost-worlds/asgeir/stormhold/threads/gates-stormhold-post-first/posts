He never cared anything about her feelings for him.But wait, a little voice in her head spoke. Wasn't it because he was always so focused, so stressed out about helping other people? Strangers?Damn the other people! Reiea's greater conscious snapped. They aren't me.The greater conscience persisted, Isn't that selfish?After I gave my all to him?\u00a0Of course not.If you're so mad, the conscience reasoned, why are you looking for him?So I can punch him in the gut, Reiea decided. Inwardly, she knew it was childish. There would be no assault when she laid eyes on that unkempt face, those battle-weary yet eternally kind eyes again. She would run up to him, draw her sword, and throw it at his feet. She'd hug him and kiss him, beg him to take her everywhere to fight like a real warrior.There were rumors of an elderly gentleman in the Free City of Isra, who for a price would grant one the knowledge needed to find whomever on the Overworld one pleased.
