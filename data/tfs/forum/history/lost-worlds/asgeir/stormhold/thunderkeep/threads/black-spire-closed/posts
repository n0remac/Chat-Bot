Kuril walked through the doorway of the Black Spire.Upon entering, they would the interior fairly cold; it was a large, dimly-lit dome-shaped room with marble walls and a marble floor.  There was nothing particularly interesting in there except for the stairs that spiraled around the dome until they disappeared into a hole at the top of the structure.  The magic in this place was impressive - incredible.  The very walls emanated immense amounts of power, and its walls gave out ancient strengths.\"This is the Black Spire.  For eons it has stood here, built by a race unknown to even us.  Whoever built it was extremely powerful, and very wise.  After there destruction, the spire stood alone, but our ancient ancestors flocked here and made a civilization around it.  This level was unlocked, as was the sub-level, though it now serves as the dungeon.  The door up above,\" Kuril nodded upwards at the hole the stairs went into, \"disappeared after enough magical power was poured into it.  The second layer was unlocked.  Through many magical tests, puzzles, and sacrifices, more doors have been locked, but we have only reached the tenth level.  This is the home of the Runelords, where we conduct our research and listen to the Ancients.  It is here... that we heard the calling... the calling of the Marsh King.\"Kuril waved his hand until an image appeared out of thin air, showing a necromancer trudging through a swamp.  \"That is the Marsh King.  An ancient, immortal, and very powerful being who lorded over the Fever Fields in ages past.\"  At that time a Varan warrior engaged in the Marsh King in brutal combat.  \"That is Vlad, the brother of Volstag, the first king of Stormhold.  He slew the Marsh King twelve times.  Every time he fell, he arose elsewhere.  He could not be defeated.\"  The image vanished and another appeared, this time it was a cloaked man, similar to Kuril.  \"That is a Runelord, a Varan who understands the ancient runic languages used by the Ancients who built this spire.  We Varan possess to much willpower to use magic effectively, so we convey the use of magic through runic inscriptions.\"  The image then showed Vlad defeating the Marsh King, and the Runelord casting a spell on its corpse.  \"With the help of this Runelord, Vlad was able to trap the Marsh King's soul.  It was a success, and the Fever Fields fell to the lordship of the Stormhold King, Volstag.  Vlad returned home a hero.\"The images then vanished and Kuril reached into his pockets.  \"Now, the Marsh King has returned.  Somehow, he has escaped his prison.  He has poisoned the swamps, and breathing in the air there will prove fatal to anyone - no matter how magically-capable you may be.\"  Kuril pulled three necklaces out of his pocket, each one with a stone and a rune on it.  \"These will protect you.  Go to the Fever Fields, venture through its dangerous swamps, and find where the Marsh King is.\u00a0 Defeat him, and trap him if you can.\u00a0 Wear these while in the swamp and you cannot be poisoned.
