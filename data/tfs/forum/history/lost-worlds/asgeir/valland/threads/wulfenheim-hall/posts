The great hall was warm and cozy, with the smell of roasted meats cooking over the central fire.  A number of veteran warriors sat at either of two long tables in the middle of the hall, talking, eating, drinking, and boasting of past deeds.  At the end of the hall, sitting on the throne, was Jarl Ralf Valgard of Valland, former adventurer, who had now taken his rightful place as Jarl of Valland.

It's 'bout all the excitement I get 'round here.\"Ralf adjusted himself in the throne.  \"But this time's different.  Seems some brigands took up residence in an old fortress north of my hold.  Don't know who they are, don't know their names, and I don't care to.  I just want'em dead.  Problem is, once we chase'em back north, they cross the straits and take up refuge at that old fortress of theirs.  It's off the northern coasts of the mainland.

And I don't know if you ever met a Varan, Rose Merosiky, but we Varan... we don't do curses.
