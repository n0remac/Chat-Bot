They were eventually surrounded by tall, ancient trees, part of a series of forests that concealed the path to the Carrion Coast.Ralf slowed his black horse down to a trot and held his hand up to show he wanted the Covenant to stop as well.  \"Hold lads, they're watching us,\" he whispered.  \"Oi,\" he hollered into the trees surrounding the group, \"it's the jarl, you fools,\" he said.  Almost two dozen Varan men and women appeared from behind the trees, all armed with knocked bows, swords, axes, shields, and all the panoply of war.  \"These ones are here to help,\" Ralf told the Varan.One of the female Varan approached the band and smiled, \"glad to see you here, my Jarl.  Was afraid you'd go soft on that throne of yours.\"Ralf shrugged, \"I needed to kill something,\" he said casually.  \"But it is good to see you too, Kyra.  Take us to the camp and tell us what you know.\"\"Of course, my Jarl,\" Kyra said.  Kyra was a shieldmaiden of House Aer, and had traveled to Isra with Aia Heijra.  She had returned to Asgeir when Aia went to the Snowy Wilds, and started to act as a chief scout for Ralf in Valland.At the camp...[/i]The camp was small, composed of a few lean-to shelters and a single, large firepit.  Some furs were stretched out nearby, obviously from the meals the Varan had hunted and eaten.  One tree had a make-shift weapons rack tied up, where a few swords, spears, axes, and shields were kept.Kyra led the group to a cliff on the edge of the forest, which overlooked a large plain, covered in jagged outcroppings that eventually became the Carrion Coast.  Miles of ocean could be seen in the distance, and if one looked hard enough they'd see the island on the horizon.\"We picked off a party three days ago, saw'em sailing on a small boat towards this way\" the blonde-haired maiden began to say.  \"Of course, the sea's already dragged our trophies to the depths.  Was a small bunch, probably scouts looking to judge the local garrisons and booty.  They're ogres, or orcs, or goblins... some sort of beat folk, afflicted with vampirism, I'd say.  But scouts... if I had to guess, they're preparing to make landfall again.\"Ralf looked over Kyra curiously, \"landfall?  How are they beaching on these rocks and not getting ripped to shreds?\"Kyra sighed and shrugged.  \"Don't know... we watch these coasts every day, all hours of the day, and somehow they show up behind us.  Just small parties, like the ones we encountered when the raiding first started.  I don't know how they're getting on land, but I know for a fact they're not scaling those rocks.\"Ralf looked on curiously, unsure of how these undead opponents were able to come into Valland at all, for there was virtually no way to come ashore here.  \"Perhaps we should wait, then,\" he said, \"for the next raiding party.  See what we can find out.  Come, let's go back to the camp fire and wait out the night.\"Kyra and Ralf retreated back to the camp and sat down around the large fire for warmth; it was cold in Asgeir, and the further north one went, the colder it got.  They drank ale and ate meats, all while the sun vanished below the horizon and darkness descended on the coasts.  The Varan offered the Covenant their own food and drink, if they wanted any.\"So,\" Ralf began to ask the members of the Merosiky.  \"Tell me more about you.

Rose let out a series of Howls in different tones and patterns, informing the covenant of movement. Shortly after the howls were let out, three beast could be seen moving in. The first creature to arrive was a black saber tooth lion with silver eyes, that was shortly followed up by two white dire wolves with silver eyes. If others were needed, they would howl for them.   The lion would morph back into the humanoid form and speak to Ralf and Rose, \"I seen them come in.

No, we are Varan and we fight our enemies face to face.\"  Of course, Ralf knew all to well Rose wanted to either gauge their strength or ambush them, but Ralf liked to tease his friends.Kyra spoke up next, \"Ralf, take the mounts.  I'll follow behind with the footmen and reinforce you when we arrive.\"Ralf nodded and shook Kyra's hand.  \"You're a good woman; I'll make sure to leave a few alive for you.\"At least ten of the Varan mounted the horses around the camp; there were enough for Ralf and Rose to mount up as well.  \"Come, Merosiky,\" Ralf said as he began to lead the way into the dark woods, \"let me show you how we fight in Asgeir.  Yah!\"Ralf and his band of warriors galloped and cantered through the thick, night-covered forest.  Some trails were already made, thanks to the activity of Kyra's scouts.  Eventually Ralf would spot faint flickers of light through the branches.  \"Quiet!  Up ahead!\"  The Jarl pointed towards the sources of light, \"torches I expect.\"  After a few moments of observing the speed of their movement he finally deduced \"dismounted.  Small raiding party.\"  The group of Merosiky and Varan horsemen found themselves positioned on the edge of the wood, just where it exited on the side of a hill; the raiders were down below, in a small valley beyond the base of the hill.One of the Varan approached from behind.  \"Lorg's farm is just south of here, my jarl.  Use to chop wood for the old coot before the winter.  Good man.  We need to act before they torch his stead.\"Ralf nodded, \"aye, we'll need those crops come winter.  Everyone ready?  Ride hard!  No retreat, no surrender!\"  Ralf's horse trotted forward and he took a warhorn out and blew into it.  A loud noise erupted from the woods...The hill's base...Waddling along in the midst of the night was a host of almost two dozen dark orcs.  Maybe there was a time when the Varan did not mind orcs; they were strong, fierce, and had a warrior culture - much like the Varan themselves - but after initial engagements against them the proud and noble Varan found that the greenskins lacked honor and discipline.  A tense rivalry was born and orc-kind had presented a foil for the Varan.  T omake matters worse, these were not ordinary orcs: these were dark orcs; black orcs; undead orcs.  These abominations had been corrupted by dark powers, their minds twisted and warped in such a way that they were more than just 'evil'; these hellish creatures could not stay in Asgeir.\"How much farther now?\" one of the orc warriors growled.\"Don't know, Lug.  Don't matter!  We there when we there!\" another growled more fiercely.  'Lug' groaned and continued his tiresome jog down the valley.A Varan warhorn blew loud and true and the company of twenty orcs ceased their movements.  \"Stop!\" cried the leader, \"look to the trees!  The flesh-bags have spotted!  Prepare for battle!\"Sure enough, a band of mounted warriors descended from the cover of trees, crying their warsongs and weaving their swords, axes, and spears in the air.  The orcs, completely undisciplined and without proper training, roared back in retaliation and led their own charge on foot.What surely felt like minutes to the combatants only happened within a few short seconds.  Varan steeds and steel clashed against orc iron and muscle.  Some of the orcs were dealt fatal blows with well-aimed attacks by the Varan warriors; some of the cavalrymen were countered and knocked from their steeds; others ran on past the initial engagement, only to dismount behind the orcs.  Varan always fought better on their feet anyhow, and the initial cavalry charge was more a shock tactic than anything.\"Kill them, kill them all,\" Ralf cried out as he dismounted his black horse.  He held his shield at such an angle that his opponent's warhammer slid right off and the weight of the hammer's head proved to much to draw back.  The steel sword in Ralf's hand found itself sliding through the orc's neck, and cocking his wrist lopped the greenskins head right off.Looking around, the undead orcs continued to fight on despite their injuries.  Those who suffered fatal injuries only got back up and engaged the Varan, who were outnumbered at the moment.\"You!\"  A green thumb pointed in Rose Merosiky 's direction.  The orc leader wore the heaviest iron armor of the bunch and wielded two great waraxes in either hand.  He was as big around as he was tall - and what a giant he was.

Rose draped his furs over the horses back before rushing behind the horses, letting them break the lines for him to slide in. The first orc Rose crossed one that had been knocked down.

Battle raged went on around Rose, the Orcs not staying down. It baffled Rose that these things kept fighting as if nothing was wrong. The Covenant members were all beasts at this time and circled around the battlezone to make sure none of the orcs escaped. The Varan seemed to be handling the situation, if the Loyalists were needed, they would move in. Knowing this, Rose knew he was relying on the warriors around him.\u00a0After knocking over a few of the smaller orcs, Rose noticed he had been spotted by one that he needed to keep alive. If he had to break every bone in the creatures body, he would do so. Whatever he planned, he had to move fast due to the armored orc coming at him. With a quick glance across the dropped weapons on the ground, Rose noticed some knives. With a quick burst he lept in the direction of the orc and rolled, grabbing the knives as he rolled, and threw one of the two. The blade was directed at the right ankle of the orc to slow it down.
