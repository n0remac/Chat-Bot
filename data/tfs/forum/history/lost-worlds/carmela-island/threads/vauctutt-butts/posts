I can do the multiple conversations in parallel bit, remember. I do know why they'd like the crystals, I asked them to ask you to get them. The primary reason is that- and this is a secret, mind you- is that I'd like to construct a sort device devised by my good friend Reese Cresno. It involves using a special sort of crystal magic to capture and harness the light of the sun itself, and then in a very complicated series of processes, coalesce it into things. We're not quite sure what all it can be made into, but probably something magical, and probably something useful. To continue research and make effective use of this discovery, we're going to need a very large crystal. The bigger the better, without any limit.\"\"And, if you can get your hands on a second crystal, Ms.\u00a0Takhana Veil is in need of a larger scrying crystal to increase her effective operations. Try to get one at least as large as you are, but larger is still preferable. Again, this is all highly confidential. You're working with state secrets. Until we can learn more about Reese's coalescing magic, it would be highly preferable not to let any who aren't directly involved know about it. And the existence of Takhana in general, as a powerful seer, that's not exactly a fact we want to be toting around.
