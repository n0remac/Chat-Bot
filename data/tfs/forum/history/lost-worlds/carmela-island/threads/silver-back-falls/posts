The journal entry is as follows:I feel as though I have been in this blasted camp for eons. It should not be taking this long for Geoffries to return from town. I should have gone instead of him this interminable boredom is driving me up the wall. I've taken to trying my hand at constructing riddles. Like poetry I find I don't have much of a knack for it, but still I am proud of this one:I am what you cannot be But you once were What I will become I am only what blind can see And of infinity and 1 I am the sum I am the cure I am the answer The riddle is the answer is the riddle is the answer A bit philosophical near the beginning of course, but they can't all be winners. Anyway if Geoffries doesn't hurry up I will run out of supplies and then where will I be? Well still here but a decaying corpse.Once the entry is read they would presumably explore the room. Near the back they would find a set of stairs. Fifty steps down they would come to a large stone door. On the ground near it is a piece of chalk. Edward would examine it for a moment and say thoughtfully.\"I've seen doors like this before.
