They produce edible seaweed, oysters, sea urchins, larger fish, and snails. The different organisms support each other and help each other grow, and the wards help protect both the farms and the natural ecosystems of the ocean itself. \"Farmers\" consist of specially trained water mages and some very good swimmers.From the surface, these farms are invisible and located mostly in lagoons around Carmela Island. When finished, they are expected to contribute food for thousands of people with minimal effort.The farms were designed by\u00a0Huata of the Dittany  with the assistance of\u00a0Va'nei Dha'zhi, Earthwarden , and were constructed with the help of personnel from the Land-Tiller's state. However, they will ultimately be under the complete ownership of the Kingdom of Gauldin.", "link_list": ["/user/1532", "/user/1056"], "image_list": ["http://smartgridsblog.com/data/out/12/303009-lagoon.jpg", "http://foodtank.com/assets/images/head/Kelp_Farm.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://smartgridsblog.com/data/out/12/303009-lagoon.jpg\" style=\"max-width:50%;\"/></div>"}}
