The aura continues to flow around him protectively, though the barrier behind her dissipates. He has to visibly calm himself, and he slowly has to rub his face. \"....Now, can you just stop testing me, before I really do intend on harming you? You're testing my limited patience, and running away is pointless.\" He explains, his voice returning to its attractively deep, resonating tone. He appears to dissipate into a plume of blackened smoke, before he appears behind her, hands resting upon her waist, if she didn't manage to react in time. All that would occur was pulling her toward him, in order to speak quietly. \"We may come to an agreement now, yes?

He was persistent, and once he's made a target out of someone, they would not simply slip away with ease.
