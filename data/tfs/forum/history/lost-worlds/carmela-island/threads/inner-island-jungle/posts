Bad news she is off balance as the Lizard man thrusts its spear at her stomach.Dango is currently unmolested since of the 5 remaining Lizard men none are near the troll.The mayor uncle watches as the two Lizard men circle him the one with out a spear darts to his left, the one still armed lunges for his stomach. The mayor steps into the lizard mans thrust crouching down and weaving to the left as he steps forward. He then launches his fist into the lizard mans side using the combined momentum of his forward lunge and and rising to his full height to provide strength to the blow. The punch is somewhere between a right hook and an upper cut and impacts into the Lizard mans side with a sickening thud of broken ribs and wet flesh. The lizard man is lifted a good three feet into the air and lands in a broken clump. It might, might not be dead but it sure as hell ain't getting up. The disarmed Lizard man though then throws itself onto the back of the Mayor Uncle and begins trying to tear out his neck.
