She was a poor traveling companion on the boatride to Carmela island, and Enigma had to suffer through most of it.When the ship finally pulled into port, however, she hefted her sack over her shoulders and stumbled onto the not-bobbing-or-swaying-or-moving dock and folded herself over the wooden railing, hurling (hopefully) her last hurl into the ocean.\"I hate this place,\" she moaned as she wiped her mouth with the back of her hand and squinted angrily at the beautiful, lush, tropical paradise that was Carmela island.
