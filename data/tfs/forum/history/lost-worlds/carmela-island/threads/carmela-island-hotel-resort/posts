They were sitting on top of some kind of red stone, perhaps sandstone or clay. It was too hard to tell. Around them were seating areas, although the chairs and benches had seen better days. Jun brought their sphere closer to the idols so they could take a closer look. The idols were of bald men with wings. Their eyes were large and blank, and they had large heads. They were smiling serenely. Jun sensed no magic coming from them.Looking around, there were other features to the room. Various trinkets and pottery, stone statues, and gleaming bits of metal buried underneath everything else. Jun couldn't quite make out what they were. Perhaps jewelry or brass linings? There were even some old rusted weapons.Jun got the impression they were gifts.
