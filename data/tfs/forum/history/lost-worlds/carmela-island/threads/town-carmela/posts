Taking Enigma by the wrist, she led him through the streamers and banners and people to the bistro itself and stepped inside. She dropped the \"Fletcher\" name, and got their table comp'd, a table situated out on the patio.Menus were brought around, and it didn't occur to Rafaela that this might be misconstrued as a date to outsiders, especially given how pale and sickly Rafaela looked and how skinny and malnourished Enigma appeared. Compared to the other beautifully-dressed people that seemed to be enjoying the sunshine, both of them looked like crackheads.Rafaela, at least, was aware of that however.

Her skin had not been cleaned, but her hair had been swept up into a high ponytail, and instead of her leather armor she wore... a dress, with sleeves that sloped over her naked shoulders, and a corset wrapped around her lithe waist. The skirt of the dress fell to just below her knees, and the quality make of her boots covered up her skin on her legs so nothing could be seen there but... still. It was a dress. And a nice one. And it looked fairly decent on her. With some food in her and some fresh air, she'd maybe start to look less sickly and more healthy and then she'd really look nice.\"Here,\" she said and pushed something towards him beneath the table. It was another bag. She glanced away from him and smiled at a passing waiter as her gloveless hands reached to cup themselves around the water glass on the bistro table. \"I have clothes for you in there. Go change so we don't stand out,\" she murmured to him.Bossing him around, of course, but her logic couldn't be argued.

However, he seemed to have dressed himself just fine, and was now wearing a nice button up short sleeve shirt with some flora patterns on it, although he left the top couple buttons undone as he had seen some others do the same. Perhaps this style emerged from the hot climate.
