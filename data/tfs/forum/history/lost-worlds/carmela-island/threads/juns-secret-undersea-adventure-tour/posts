{"post-17141": {"user": "Jun of the Celadine", "user_num": 108, "timestamp": "1448607396000", "message": "Now open for business! (takes place after Jun's vacation)If you ask around Carmela Island, you may here rumors of a special tour offered only to the most discerning tourists and adventures. This is of course nothing more than a marketing ploy designed to make customers feel special and keep business small and lucrative until Jun is able to expand the business. The service itself is however genuinely remarkable.There's a mysterious little pier hidden in a grove on the island where Jun takes her clients. From there, she works her magic, literally. With a spell that's entirely her own invention, she is able to create a comfortable, breathable psionic sphere that acts as a submersible. Thus she can take small groups of people underwater on the adventure of a lifetime.She offers several packages, including:The Coral Reef AdventureA tour of the most beautiful coral reefs close to Carmela, complete with basic marine biology lessons at no extra charge. The most affordable package and recommended for all ages.The Dolphin Feeding FrenzyA chance to interact with and feed the local dolphin population. This particular tour is a bit more expensive as the logistics of feeding dolphins fish from inside a psionic bubble put quite a strain on the spell caster. Highly recommended among couples.The Deep Sea Horror ShowThe most expensive tour of all, and the most dangerous. The submersible is pushed to its limits to explore the deep sea and witness the most mysterious and frightening creatures mother nature has to offer. Each trip pretty much guarantees patrons the chance to see animals that no one on earth has ever seen before. Extremely popular with scholars and fearless nobles.So far the numbers are looking good. Her investor Calico Swartz has advised her to keep prices relatively high, since Carmela's visitors can obviously afford it, and it helps minimize competition with the snorkeling industry. Jun has even started training other mages to act in her steed for when she inevitably leaves the island to continue her adventures (only now with a small fortune lining her pockets).", "link_list": ["https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPNrR_ouHQw", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgC-XJyErwY", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGyteuH5fG0", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPNrR_ouHQw", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0XoZCr__zo", "/user/717"], "image_list": ["http://images7.alphacoders.com/311/311619.jpg", "https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.totango.com%2Fblog%2F2014%2F05%2F5-keys-to-a-customer-success-dream-team%2F&psig=AFQjCNF7j8nP9M6Eqzs0d98Tq0wCD2xPDA&ust=1448691838185972", "http://img3.goodfon.su/wallpaper/big/e/e0/tropical-coral-reef-1928.jpg", "http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/files/2008/06/590_dolphdef_sound.jpg", "http://news.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/news/photos/000/600/60025.ngsversion.1422031624509.adapt.768.1.jpg", "http://aims-movingplanner.fr/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/pi%C3%A8ces-argent-qui-tombent.jpg"], "html": "<div align=\"center\">Now open for business!
