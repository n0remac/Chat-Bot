What was causing the collapse could be surmised by the nature of the beastly plants which besieged their great city. The large, glowing fruits of the vines came in many colors.

But she hoped the magnitude of the spell was well worth the price.A tear came to Jun's eye, but she couldn't help but smirk at her very own audacity. Druidic magic wasn't meant to be used this way.

At this point, it is worth again exploring the composition of the Legion. While none of the cohorts are comprised only of soldiers with the same equipment, they are themed. The two principal components of the Legion are the heavy infantry of the First, Second, Third, and Fourth, and the archers of the Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth. The legions of heavy infantry are comprised primarily of soldiers in partial and full plate armor. They all carry large, rectangular shields, and wield a mix of spears, pikes, and different sorts of swords. As a secondary element, a significant number of Enclave healers and warding magic specialists are also part of these cohorts. Meanwhile, the archers are comprised primarily of just that. The majority of them carry longbows, as Isra\u2019s most highly trained marksmen. Among them, there is a fair number who carry crossbows. Those who carry crossbows have somewhat heavier armor compared to the longbows, and also carry a short sword and small shield, giving them some modest ability to engage in melee combat. Additionally, a smattering of Enclave battle mages and warding specialists are part of The Fifth through Eighth. The two remaining cohorts are specialized for sieges. The majority of their soldiers are spearmen who have also been trained in battlefield engineering, at least so much as to be able to assemble and operate siege weaponry. Along with them, there are a handful of the marksmen as mentioned earlier, a significant number of Enclave battle mages and defenders. When moving, these cohorts bring with them the necessary supplies to perform their task of assembling and operating siege weapons and building fortifications. Lumber, boulders, bolts, logs, all of that. In any case, the Legion follows the orders handed down to them from Lady Naoki, and brace for cavalry. Lines of spearmen at the front, pointy end pointing out, shields raised, almost shoulder to shoulder. The archers pull out their arrows and load their crossbows, in preparation for firing. The longbows would, upon direction, fire in an arc toward the cavalry, with the intention of landing the volley on them before they can close the distance. Those griffin riders who are not part of the Dawn Rider offensive come to hover in a few positions roughly central to New Birimarde, and open their saddlebags. From their saddlebags, pieces of paper begin to fall. In a manner not dissimilar to snow, hundreds of bits of parchment drift down to land all across the city. Each one reads as follows.\u00a0 Empress Naoki said:To the commander of this garrison, soldiers and officers within, and whomever else this may concern, You must surrender. Consider the following:You are outnumbered, out supplied, totally isolated. My army is backed by the industrial power and economic strength of The Free States of Isra. We will continually be resupplied and reinforced until the inevitable victory is obtained. You are backed by nothing. You have no more than what is within your city at this present moment, and will receive no aid. You will have no resupplies. There is no cavalry coming. If you continue to resist, you will either run afoul of Isran arrow or steel, or face death by starvation. None of those possibilities are particularly appealing, I would think, yet they are all but certain if you do not surrender. In the event of your surrender, the following will be offered to all officers and soldiers: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You will be treated pursuant with the International Accord of Universal Rights and Protections. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You will not be killed without just cause. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You will not be tortured without just cause. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You will be fed, and clothed, treated humanely, and kept in hospitable conditions. The above applies to all who surrender or are captured, regardless of rank or position. You will not be charged with war crimes for the first 90 days of your surrender, or until such time as order is fully restored. If you do not surrender, the following will be offered to all officers and soldiers:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You will die.Please consider this offer, and send a response at your earliest convenience. No messengers will come to harm, nor any who approach with intent to surrender. This offer will stand indefinitely, and applies to any and all of you. To the rank and file soldiers receiving this message: if your officers and commanders ignore your wellbeing and drag you into such an impossible fight, know that we will receive every soldier wishing to surrender, be it one man or one hundred, with the same assurances as above. ~High Lady Naoki of Isra,However, Goraia\u2019s cavalry may experience some difficulties on account of the result of Jun\u2019s druidic magic, which was performed with the express intent of blocking the gate, preventing it from opening outward, and severely impeding prevent anyone inside New Birimarde from exiting, especially large groups.Additionally, it should be noted that The Dawn Riders, (The Free States of Isra    ) ride griffins, which fly. An example of a Dawn Rider officer can be seen in Knight-Captain Calgary  , riding his griffin.
