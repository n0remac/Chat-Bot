One moves to the base of the pier, while their partner remains more or less in the center of it. They are very obviously on guard, hands on their weapons, looking every which way to scan for threats.Those standing on the deck of The Depravity remain vigilant as well, effectively all eyes turned outward.Within The Depravity, there is movement, but it cannot be discerned of what sort from outside.Alongside the Depravity, two ships of the line dock, as well as three transport ships. There is little movement from these ships, they simply dock and maintain an active guard, probably awaiting orders.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "As the reds and oranges of the sunset are beginning to transition into the lavenders and pinks of twilight, several Isran ships dock at the port.

The view, she notes, isn\u2019t nearly as commanding as it was from the deck, from a fair distance away from the city. From here, all she can see is the underside of a pier, the surface of the water, and the lower portions of some buildings built along the waterfront. Furrowing her eyebrows slightly, Naoki turns away, back into the ship. The compartment in which she currently stands is one of the well furnished ones toward the rear of the vessel, complete with carpet on the floor, a small chandelier, and other trappings of luxury. A large, circular table dominates the room\u2019s floor space, ringed around the perimeter with chairs, while some triangular cabinets serve to round out the corners of the otherwise square room. Just next to the door, across the table from Naoki, an utterly unremarkable aide stands quietly at attention, having been sent for earlier. Raising one hand in his direction, Lady Naoki addresses him. \u201cSend for Countess Camilla Blake , bring her to me here. If her family or entourage would like to come, so be it, but I only ask that Camilla herself be here at midday tomorrow, as that is when I will hold a meeting to discuss the fate of Medan. See to it that she is able to attend.\u201dAfter offering a single nod of affirmation in response, the aide turns and leaves the room, presumably to attend to his task. For a few minutes longer, Naoki remains in the room, utilizing her earring to dispatch more orders and inform the relevant individuals of her intentions to hold a meeting. She requests specifically that Emahra Untyrid , Elizabeth Finch  and Jun of the Celadine be present, but informs all relevant parties and leaves the door open if Lamina Manira  and/or Arya Shieldheart  would like to attend.With all of this done, Naoki retreats to her quarters aboard The Depravity, with the intention of spending a bit of time \u2018relaxing\u2019 with Forni before taking a nap.

Wordlessly, she extends her palm. He places the letter into her hand and takes a large step back.

Though she hasn\u2019t been consciously thinking about it, Naoki realizes that this certainly is an, \u201cI told you so\u201d moment for her. Though Naoki had been expecting the Goraians to put up significantly more of a fight than this, it is true that she was expecting the \u2018war\u2019 to go more or less to this extent, as in a short bout of fighting followed by unconditional surrender. In the relatively long time between when the coup happened and Isra declared war, Isra dramatically grew its military, and the political instability inherent to coups ran its course, making today an excellent day for all Goraian officials with half a mind to abandon their posts and run for their lives, consequentially making the \u2018war\u2019 little more than a glorified peaceful annexation.While Naoki did declare war with strategies and preparations in place to fight a \u2018real\u2019 war, they have proven to be unnecessary as she had hoped.Which, on a very pleasing note, means that no one else will die and that Jun doesn\u2019t have a leg to stand on when it comes to criticizing Naoki\u2019s policy decisions.
