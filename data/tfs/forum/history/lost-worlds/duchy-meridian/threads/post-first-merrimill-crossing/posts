Approaching the first man in line, Maris stopped walking and stepped towards the soldier, getting uncomfortably close, while silently staring the man in the eyes, trying to gauge their composure. After maybe 30 seconds of this, he would step back, forcibly correct their posture to at least look presentable, and then continue down the line.

One, when I give you an order, you follow it, no if, ands, or buts about it. Two, there will be no factionalism here. You are a single unit, and you will act like it. That means you will work together, march together, eat together, fight together, and be punished together. Three, you will also obey any and all rules of the Gorarian military when you are under my command. Now, if any of you wish to actually make it through this war, much less this mission, alive, you all will need training, and your lieutenant had some ideas in that regard.

Instead his reasoning was a rather different one - a psychological cocktail consisting of looking them over for the slightest weaknesses that he could find and an intensity in his quiet pacing that would put unease into their hearts. He wanted them to know he was dangerous, but not give anything specific away in order to equally gain their awe, fear and respect. Eventually he spoke up with a voice that was low yet calm, like a frost-edged sword. \"By this time tomorrow you will have played a game with lady death. There is no such thing as game-changing luck when facing her down, for luck is merely the result of preparation. Prepare well and you will survive, prepare poorly and you will die,\" he told them. \"Unfortunately for all of you, there is very little time to prepare most of you with the training I would have liked you to have, so to start with you will make do with two pieces of advice I have to give you: do what you're told when you're told to do it and don't let the person next to you be harmed, no matter who it is.\"With that said he moved back towards the line and began to pick members out, then shuffle their position like they were a deck of cards in his hand.
