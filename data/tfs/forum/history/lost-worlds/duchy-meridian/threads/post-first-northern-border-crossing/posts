This was the Second Legion of Isra's Army, a large force -- currently comprised of pikemen, archers, and mages of the healing, battle, and defensive varieties. At the head of this legion was the striking figure of Sun Marshal Emahra Untyrid, her blue hair twisted back into a braid and the heirloom sword of her fallen House at her left hip. Golden eyes assessed the tunnel that loomed in the mountain ahead of them, and then the Elf reined her white mare to a halt, raising her hand to indicate the columns behind her should also stop. Shouts commanding the cease march of the armed forces rippled through the ranks until finally all of the Legion was at a parade rest.Accompanying Emahra were Inspector Zurt and Tyrus Sephiran, and it was to these two that she turned as a large white wolf with golden eyes loped up beside the mare, coming to a halt and flicking his ears forward. There was an intensity about the animal's actions as he examined the tunnel that belied an intelligence far beyond that of most animals, and Emahra smiled fondly as she reached down - the wolf's back being nearly even with that of the mare, it wasn't much of a reach - so that she could scratch behind one of his ears. Then she was addressing Zurt and Tyrus in a calm, assured voice, one that bespoke a great familiarity with being in command. This woman had been raised to lead not just armies, but an entire nation, and it showed in her bearing.\"Once Commodore Finch arrives, we will convene to establish strategy. Until then, I recommend you take some time to stretch and refresh yourselves. It is going to be a long day.\" With that thought in mind, the woman's gaze flicked briefly toward the sky in search of the leader of the Dawn Riders and her forces. Brushing her fingertips against one of the gems in her Marshal's badge, which was pinned to a scarf wound around her hips, her thoughts reached out via the Isran government's telepathy network to make contact with Elizabeth Finch.\"Commodore Finch, how close are you to the rendezvous point?

This was the Second Legion of Isra's Army, a large force -- currently comprised of pikemen, archers, and mages of the healing, battle, and defensive varieties. At the head of this legion was the striking figure of Sun Marshal Emahra Untyrid, her blue hair twisted back into a braid and the heirloom sword of her fallen House at her left hip. Golden eyes assessed the tunnel that loomed in the mountain ahead of them, and then the Elf reined her white mare to a halt, raising her hand to indicate the columns behind her should also stop. Shouts commanding the cease march of the armed forces rippled through the ranks until finally all of the Legion was at a parade rest.<br><br/>Accompanying Emahra were <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-915 group-0\" href=\"/user/915\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@placeholder\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Inspector Zurt</span></a></span> and <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-266 group-0\" href=\"/user/266\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@tyrus\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Tyrus Sephiran</span></a></span>, and it was to these two that she turned as a large white wolf with golden eyes loped up beside the mare, coming to a halt and flicking his ears forward. There was an intensity about the animal's actions as he examined the tunnel that belied an intelligence far beyond that of most animals, and Emahra smiled fondly as she reached down - the wolf's back being nearly even with that of the mare, it wasn't much of a reach - so that she could scratch behind one of his ears. Then she was addressing Zurt and Tyrus in a calm, assured voice, one that bespoke a great familiarity with being in command. This woman had been raised to lead not just armies, but an entire nation, and it showed in her bearing.<br/><br/><font color=\"0000FF\">\"Once Commodore Finch arrives, we will convene to establish strategy.
