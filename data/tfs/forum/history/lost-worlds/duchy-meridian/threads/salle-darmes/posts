Back in the good old days, when the flag was still green and spirits ran high, the collective who ran the Salle D'armes, a small but immaculate training area within a little building beyond the estate's overgrown wall, made it routine to hire and promote the most esteemed and professional of fencers to impart lessons among the various students who practiced their trade school to school. Historians are unsure of the exact cultural origins of the establishment's name and some of its architectural themes, but a similar origin to the modern day culture of Gauldish was considered by the majority to be the most likely.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A single gloved hand reached out to push open the training hall's door without preamble, its thick and knotted wooden frame creaking on aging hinges for what may have been the first time in years. Dantess stepped inside a now spider-infested hall, darkened by the lack of maintained lighting and yet still sporting the white paint on its hardwood floor, which depicted a line from one end to the other and was divided in the center by a small ring.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He remembered it as though it were yesterday... slightly younger, emboldened and new to the notion of being officially among \"the best,\" the last time Dantess stepped foot in the Salle D'armes was a summons to further his own skill through the act of teaching. It had become commonplace among the elites, after all, to express the notion that all that which is taught is most firmly remembered by the teacher. He closed his eyes... How he remembered the session, the lessons imparted and the young man he was to train...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Such spirits the world once enjoyed.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>"}, "post-29966": {"user": "Zagarus", "user_num": 1098, "timestamp": "1458843342000", "message": "\"I do hope you feel relieved of the pressure.\"A deep, silken voice spoke from some distance beyond the open door. Zagarus' boots could be heard crunching grass as he strode up to the lonely structure that Dantess had entered, its open door revealing an interior that seemed too dark to see from the brightness of the mid-day's sun. Stepping inside, he gazed upon the floor, memories of his own training returning to him from his own periodic visits to this school, mainly for practice in the heavier blades.
