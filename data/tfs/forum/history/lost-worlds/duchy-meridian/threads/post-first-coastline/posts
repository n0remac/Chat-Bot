Through this earring, I speak directly to each officer present here today and command them as a cohesive force. The quickest and most effective way for the Goraian forces to win any given battle and seriously disrupt our offensive would be to remove my capability to do that. As such, it\u2019s somewhat important to our efforts and Isra as a whole that I am not killed. Furthermore, my ability to defend myself against individuals such as yourself, those skilled in swordplay and the like... is quite limited. I have a small amount of magic at my disposal, and I can move fairly quickly if given the chance, but that\u2019s about the extent of it. So it will be your responsibility to see that some assassin doesn\u2019t drop down on my head and run me through with something sharp.\u201dGiven the somewhat morbid nature of her words, Naoki's tone of voice remains light and somewhat pleasant. \u201cFor now, that means standing right about here, and keeping your eyes open.\u201d Gesturing, Naoki indicates a spot on the floor adjacent to her, off to one side.", "link_list": ["/user/1515"], "image_list": [], "html": "Turning on the spot to observe Marshal Manira as she approaches, Naoki opens her mouth as if to respond in greeting, but is interrupted by the far-off cry of something probably quite large.
