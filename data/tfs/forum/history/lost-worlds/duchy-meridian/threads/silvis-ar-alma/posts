Folk lore tells that the town founded by a goddess who had planted the forest. For many years the town of Silvis has lived in peace. \u00a0It is recorded that Silvis was once hidden deep in the Usque, but though the passing of time and the fading of the old magic the edge of the forest has crept ever closer. Descendants of the villages founders, the Silva tribe, still remain as a respectable family. The villagers farm the fields outside and hunt the game within. Recent years have brought more travelers and trade to the Usque ar \u00d1alma. Most valuable of the Silvis goods are the magnificent yew bows.  The finest bows were once made of black yew, but due to the tree's rareness they are no longer produced.Unfortunately, dark times are upon Silvis de \u00d1alma. \u00a0Hitherto Silvis had remained hidden in the forest; undisturbed by the governments that had claimed the land. Now, in these times of war, Silvis is on the map and has drawn the eye of an ambitious Medani general.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/y7XsDg2.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/y7XsDg2.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}, "post-60075": {"user": "Wah Doobie", "user_num": 2059, "timestamp": "1486586638000", "message": "A large rock slab crashed through the forest and abruptly stops, the little being that was on top of it was launched out of the forest and into town.
