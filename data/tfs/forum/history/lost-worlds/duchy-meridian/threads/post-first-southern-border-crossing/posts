A wine from a richer realm.\" He stated, offering him the other cup by simply sliding it forward. \"So now you know what I wish to prepare for, and why I am to say and for how long. These ogres... are mindless, barbaric creatures.\" He looked to them with impression. \"And yet they can wield the spells an arcane may to the most chaotic level, strike with a wooden sword to impale even the paladins of this world. They are by far the most loyal race meant for combat I've experienced with, and for simply taking my stay, you may have yourself a faction of some of the strongest beings in the wilderness.\"He looked back to Tullius, levitating a pouch from behind him. \"But such does not fulfill the expense of my stay, correct? I've kept what I could from the small business I've formed, a mining company. The Gems of Kaz'Aldoon.\" He opened the pouch to reveal a handful of strangely shaped, raw, pink crystals. However, these crystals lashed out towards Tullius' eyes, a sudden addiction (If he were a mortal, which is most likely) surging his veins, a mindset telling him he needed to have these crystals. \"Rare upon all commodities, and quite hard to find.\" The only reason why Thrashnald had control over this emotion was because of the birthright he had, as a Stone Orc, the last race to have resisted such rare, nearly gone, gems. \"So, I hope this would fill the gap remaining for my stay?\" He questioned, gold from another bag slowly pouring over the gems, for if any of the soldiers witnessed them they would have the sudden addiction as well. \"I would like somewhere near the Shadow District, it seems the elements I will need upon experimentation are there. And do be mindful where you place these ogres. They are loyal, yes, but even the tamest of wild beasts think they have exceptions, like perhaps the miners within the caves. If they see fit that they're doing a better job than the minority of lazy workers... they might have a second meal to themselves.\"With that, Thrashnald kept his chest puffed out, back straight, and chin up, even though he felt his barter was quite fair, he still wished to hold a mighty respect for this General Tullius who accepted his request for Audience. The purple crystal was valuable, yes, but to the mortals who saw these gems... it meant the world. Of course, this was his last resort, he had plans to make, and fast.
