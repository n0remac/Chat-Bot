I guess it's like trying to write with a pencil that's too small for you, or trying to make a detailed ice sculpture with a small cube.\" Jun made it to the platform. Carefully she removed her robe and folded it onto the ground, revealing her small but taut frame. Camilla would be able to see the chains that dangled from her arms in full view, which ran from a scepter stashed beneath her knapsack to some gauntlets on her arms. \"And part of how she became so powerful was the methods she used to overcome her disability.\"She held up one hand. \"Most mages in my clan focus their magical energies with one hand and then manipulate it with another. They do it subtly so you can't always see it working, but the manipulation is there.\" As she explained this, the air around her raised hand began to change, becoming wavy and heavy. \"This is normally where my scepter would be.\" Sparks began to fly from her hand as a little blue jet of flame appeared at her palm. She raised it above her head and thrust her hand abruptly towards the sky. A fireball the size of a brick careened into the air at high speed, accompanied by the sound of shrieking air. \"Lynx needed both hands to manipulate magic, so she at first used her body as a focal point. Her spells were powerful, but exhausting. So she developed this rig you see, allowing her to use both hands but still focus her energies more carefully.\"Jun then focused both her hands towards one of the pillars. In between her hands appeared a small, vibrating dark point of shadow. She thrust it towards the pillar, and immediately vines of blackness whipped out from her body and wrapped themselves around the pillar, constricting it.\"What do you think so far? I have more to show you if you're not in a hurry.\" Jun felt a sense of pride well up in her. She had never really explained her powers to an outsider before, and getting to include her family in her lecture made the sensation even warmer. She could only hope Camilla was impressed.

Indeed, watching the fireball whistling into the sky had been a nice diversion from that nervous pacing she had been doing when she and Jun first started to talk. Plans were formulating in the princess' mind at that moment in time. She already felt like the young lady would be a valuable asset, not only to Medan and the Guild, but possibly in her household as a Lady in Waiting. It would be a high honor, and it would not normally be bestowed on one who was not of noble blood... Though she did not know from whence Jun had come or her bloodline, not that it mattered to her at all. It was rather nice to know there were kindred spirits about.Camilla also had no intentions of filling the spots of her ladies with useless creatures who did nothing but embroider. She wanted strong and independent women in her company because she was a strong and independent woman. She wanted female friends who would teach as well as learn, and she had so many ideas about how to best serve the Kingdom of Medan. So far, Jun and Feruzia were the only two whom had shown her any merit as someone who would be of good stock for her Ladies in Waiting.\u201cI mean it... This is amazing... And I have a thought as to what you can do, not only for me, but for this kingdom. I need ladies... But I find them boring and useless if all they do is gossip and ply a needle to tapestries. I don't think they would be much of an asset to our cause at all. What would you say to becoming one of my attendants... A companion, if you will. You would not be confined to the solar like those in many other kingdoms.., Oh no... I need strong ladies who can defend themselves and their kingdom. I also need those who can travel with me.

Underground her mind became mycelium that began to recede towards a thick clump of roots. Consciousness drifted up through roots, stem, and leaf exiting the leaf through reverse photosynthesis.  Quis and Puck drifted up above the dandelion patch and the entirety of the Garden Nation came into view.  Their corporeal forms sat in a tree in the center of the garden. The Castle of Goraia lay to the south.  Bordering the three other walls of the garden was the thick dandelion patch. Long razor sharp vines reached into the air, grasping for the red light.Towards the west the mine was being dug by a crew of rodents and insects. A small forge had been set up, capable of firing a couple bricks at a time. South of the mine, along the castle wall, the new garden was growing.  Grape vines were beginning to climb up the side of the castle and more terraces were being made.East of the tree was a small pond with an island in the middle.

They continued their trip back though time: an army approached from the north, fires filled the sky and burned in the east.  A cloaked figure walks the parapet and an icy finger creeps up the spine. Darkness.Next, a scene of a royal court flashes by.  There are more wars, more fighting, yet no fire. The land is lush and pristine. Forests and gardens fill the land. Four gem alight the golden crown of a beautiful queen. But there is darkness once more.Elves now ruled the Usque Al Namar forest. Trees covered the land as far as the eye could see. Yet wars are still fought. Given the power of the gems, which could shape the land or destroy it, no beings could live in peace. Darkness once more.In a flash of fire a phoenix was born.  The majestic bird flew up into the sky and diapered into the cosmos beyond.  Puck and Quis would fall back, forward though time and witness all they had seen once more.
