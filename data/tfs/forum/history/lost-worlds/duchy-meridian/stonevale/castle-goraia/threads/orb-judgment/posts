His cloaked arms would be crossed, his very presence imparting an air of both stability and condemnation, and it always seemed to get a little colder... much welcomed by those who worked near flames.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>"}, "post-60587": {"user": "Grandma", "user_num": 602, "timestamp": "1488095694000", "message": "Stonevale as a whole was in a general panic. Rumors were spreading like wildfire through the city that the rest of Goraia had fallen swiftly to Isra\u2019s invasion force and that most of the top brass had already abandoned the city. Even the most feckless Goraian supporters were beginning to lose hope as more and more people abandoned the city to head for the countryside or the border. Still, a decent amount of the most loyal soldiers stayed in Stonevale, whether to resist against Isra to the end or offer a proper surrender was anyone's guess. Perhaps those who wish to fight were banking on the orb's power to turn around an assault on the city. It was due to these circumstances that Grandma had decided to carry out her task now. The city was on the brink of being taken by Isra, but the armies of Isra had yet to reach it and the Orb of Judgement would claim many lives if not dealt with first. The orb was also far less well defended than it had been previously as all the deserters spread the defenders quite thin. Still, Grandma didn\u2019t plan to underestimate any defenses that might be in place to guard the orb, she intended to simply take it and leave before any alarm could be raised.The air beside the tallest floor of the tower warped as Grandma\u2019s form materialized there. As soon as she was entirely there, a sphere of magic disruption was extended around her while simultaneously she shot upwards towards the orb, propelled by the two black wings that extended from her back. She didn\u2019t slow at all as she approached the orb, snatching it from its perch and continuing to hurtle upwards at a high speed, body tensed. Now several hundred feet above where the orb had been resting, Grandma dropped the antimagic orb that had been surrounding her. As soon as the antimagic had dissipated, Grandma\u2019s form was already melting away, orb in hand.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Stonevale as a whole was in a general panic.
