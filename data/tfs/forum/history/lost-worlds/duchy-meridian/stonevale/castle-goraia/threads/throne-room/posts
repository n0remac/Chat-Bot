Pies and pastries of every variety dotted the table amid the presentation, coupling with sugar-plums for an extravagant and plentiful dessert.

Of course, this is quite vague, so I shall explain. Your county would supply the order with a building that would work as a hall for it, for now, it need not be very large, we have few men and we do not expect great support until we show positive results. We have plenty of food, but some would be expected to be offered when we are out of supplies. In return, we would start by identifying every magic user in the county and supervising them. Laws would be recommended to you, but of course not enforced unless you deem them acceptable. Most commonly, the staring laws we propose is that all magic users be documented and receive proper schooling in their art before legally have usage of it; that there be a bi-yearly analysis of the developments and known usages of their skills; and that all orphans that are magic users be taken under the care of the Inquisition; and any arcane-involved businesses would need to be researched by the order and any supplies they have looked into, as to not allow dangerous items to be sold under you nose, sire. Of course, before we're able to give proper schooling, we need to build the proper facilities and receive a greater number of Inquisitors that could teach such arts. Orphans could be taken in as soon as said facilities were built, as I could serve as a temporary tutor, along with Jeremiah. More laws would be suggested as the order looks into your government's situation.\" He leans back against the seat, one leg crossing over the other. \"But of course, that is not all we offer. While all of my men know how to fight, that is not all they do, our acolytes and even inquisitors are commonly sent to do many tasks, so we could help the expansion of the town. I come with four other inquisitors, I've served with them for many years, all of them splendid fighters which could likely help with the training of your town guard. And besides such, the order is a force of balance, so if there are any enemies of the state, we would help with their capture or execution. As time goes on, the order tends to start helping states to a greater degree, but that is much further down the line, if we gain your trust. Such as constructing and managing arcanic guilds and banking. But, I must explain one thing, although the order aids the governments that take it in, and will respect their decisions, it is not commanded by those governments and nor is it a governmental agency. We will not get involved in wars or political conflicts unless we deem the enemy a danger to order and balance.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Both Asim and Jeremiah followed the king to the table, waiting for him to sit first, and only then sitting down themselves.

Uhm... but yes! He taught me the basics of every discipline known by the Inquisition, and I gained mainly a focus on alchemy, dispelling, and enchanting!\" Asim gave a light clap to Jeremiah, before speaking himself. \"This is the usual training for all magic users within the Inquisition. All disciplines are taught, at least the theory; there is no point in hiding the other arts from them, they will encounter them sooner or later, and so we should prepare them. All magical arts can be used to help society, and so none are taboo.
