Money spoke, after all, and it told such wonderful tales, if one truly listened. As Lady Zaiyandorel herself was in the intelligence business, it served to have at least some of this logic.The distinguished, black-clad woman stepped through the doors of the Central Bank, chic in silk trousers and tall boots, and a velvet-and-lace wrap around her upper body. The height of fashion; it was one of her indulgences. She did so love pretty things.Gold decorated her thick, dark hair that was pulled into a loose bun at the nape of her neck, tendrils of her dark hair artfully places to frame her gorgeous face. Her pointed ears were obvious as they stuck out from her hair, the palor of her skin pale, as if she did not see the sun often. Her eyes were dark and they glittered like looking into the heart of galaxies.Approaching one of the bank-tellers, she spoke eloquently. A well-dressed woman who spoke eloquently usually gave off the impression of wealth, influence, and at least some power. And those who enjoyed money, usually enjoyed those who embdoied these three things.\"I am Lady Zaiyandorel,\" she told the bank-teller. \"I would like to inquire about certain ownership of buildings within Stonevale, with a hope to invest or own several.

Here was a room that was impossibly inviting, kept perfectly dust free, plush chairs and a nice desk kept in immaculate condition. Despite the lack of an externally visible chimney from the building's exterior, a small fireplace burned heartily in the corner. To the right, a wooden clock of skillful crafting and clockwork ticked around an elegantly painted design that abstractly depicted the hours of the day.The woman sat in the chair across from the dark oaken desk, where a quill, inkwell, and blank parchment awaited.\"Please, have a seat.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"Ah, okay, just one moment,\" the bank teller said.

The Ring of Shadows, a ring shared only with the Dark Lord himself, was wrapped around one slender finger. Its symbols were only faintly glowing blue. What Olina didn't see was the little puncture wounds around her finger where the inside of just such a ring bit into her flesh to feed off of her blood beneath. It was a trait unique to the Ring of Shadows itself, unshared by the Black or Grey Rings.\"I have spoken to Fundor, the dragon of Stonevale. I will be renting his residence, but I am also interested in purchasing several more.
