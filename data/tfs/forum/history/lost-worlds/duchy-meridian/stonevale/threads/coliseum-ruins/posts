A scarlet beam tore through the air, visible through closed eyelids, coning outwards from that singular point atop the castle to a radius that engulfed most of the city's old arena. A deafening roar and the electrifying scent of ozone permeated the air as smoke cleared over several minutes. What remained were a few ominous pillars ringed around the left hemisphere of a diagonally bored hole in the earth, which extended to petrifying lengths down underneath the city and partially beyond. A few of the more secretive underground passages, chambers, and catacombs beneath the coliseum went untouched, having slipped beneath the angle of the beam, though nothing but air remained of the stands or the performance ring.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From high above in the sky, atop the tallest spire of the castle of Goraia, Judgment had been passed for the first time.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>"}, "post-25174": {"user": "Lamina Manira", "user_num": 157, "timestamp": "1456347428000", "message": "It was in those secret passages and chambers where Lamina resides, having laid claim to the abandoned arena and given permission by the government of Medan to live within its walls.

She came crawling to the edge, stranded in two levels beneath the earth with no way to the surface, visibly coughing for air.
