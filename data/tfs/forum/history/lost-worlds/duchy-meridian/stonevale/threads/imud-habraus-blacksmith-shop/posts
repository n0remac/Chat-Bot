Now that she was about to go off on an adventure, Jun started to realize how much she relied on magic. During her battle, Harlen would have attacked her with a sword, and if for some reason her magic had been disabled, she'd be helpless. It was for reasons like this Jun steered clear of the Arcane Inquisition. Although they seemed relatively benign, she didn't like the idea of being around people who could shut down her magic. (Although, being relatively powerful, Jun didn't know if in fact they could shut her down, but she definitely didn't want to find out).Where did her parents fit into all this? Her mother, Ying-Na, was an extremely skilled archer. And her father, Raynor, knew his way around a warhammer.Jun had no combat skills other than magic.And for the first time, that irked her.So, she decided to check out the blacksmith, to see what kinds of weapons she could find and if anyone was willing to teach her how to use them.It was at this point that she would encounter a young, dark-skinned man with grey pants and a black shirt, about her height, and she noticed that he was armed with two small daggers.She kind of liked daggers...\"Hey, you're a dagger user right?

The furnace was still warm, although the owner was nowhere to be found (Jun wasn't aware of the confrontation with Raven). Jun kept doing back-takes at Jill, ostensibly to make sure she was safe and gather her impressions on the place, but also to make sure she didn't steal anything, for even Jun was tempted by what they suddenly perceived to be a wealth of magical materials, including gems, hairs of extremely rare creatures, and rare metals and alloys.There was also an assortment of strange and and intricately designed weapons. Most of them had labels on them, so Jun assumed they had been commissioned by the owner's patrons. However, there were a few that were only marked with prices... most of which were obscenely high, though the quality of the weapons was undeniable.\"Creator above these are amazing...\" Jun wished she had brought more gold with her, but she figured there was no harm in writing a royal account promissory note (as long as it wasn't too high) to cover the difference (not that different from a modern day check).After she and Jill looked around some more, Jun's eyes settled on a strange little piece sitting on a work-bench in the corner. It wasn't a bladed weapon, but rather a type of club. She'd never seen such a weapon before. It was a long, hard paddle of wood with obsidian-looking bits sharpened and cleverly inserted into the frame. The paddle-like weapon looked like a saw with teeth on both sides.There was a journal with notes next to it. Jun decided to pick up the journal and skim through it. Unfortunately it was written in a language she did not understand. However, the diagrams revealed that a weapon like this suffered the weakness of being incredibly brittle and unable to withstand the blows of swords. But it was such a beautiful and elegant design that Jun surmised whoever commissioned this weapon must have desperately wanted it to be viable in combat, and that the only way to do so was to construct it of legendary materials...... a request which Imud apparently obliged. Where ever this wood came from, it was solid and heavy, and had some sort of natural varnish to it. And although the stones looked like obsidian at first glance, Jun noticed they had an unnatural lack of luster or shine. It did have a purplish hue, and gave off an invisible aura, warm and rather comfortable and resonating in her presence.\"Dark magic energy...?\" Jun, going off a hunch, raised her hand to the paddle and released a light flame to it. Seeing no visible effect, she intensified the flames. Still nothing. \"Fire proof wood?\"Jun went back to the journal and flipped through the pages until she saw some symbols she recognized. Indeed, the weapon seemed to resonate with dark and fire elements. These materials, whatever they were, were definitely special. And Jun felt inexplicably comfortable with its design as she picked up the weapon. To her surprise, there was a faint glow at the weapon's based, a sort of small blue spark which made the rest of the club feel almost physically pleasurable to hold.On the last page of the journal entries, Jun saw what the creator had intended to name the weapon, and a brief description. \"Sword Breaker, Redeemer of Primitive Weapons. The perfect weapon for warriors who wish to catch the wealthy weapon-elitists off guard. You may be mocked at first, but rest assured when the battle's over, there will be one less sword in the world! This is one club you can bring to a sword fight! Haha!\"The proposed asking price was a considerable chunk of her savings... but something told Jun she needed to have this weapon. She decided that since the item was never formally put on sale, maybe she could get away with low-balling it. That's when she noticed one more detail. In the schematics of Imud's journal there was a little section which had not been check-marked. It seemed like some kind of vile was intended to be placed at the end of the weapon, right where the blue spark appeared when Jun held the club. Jun looked around and saw a list written in the common language of Medan. There were material names that were crossed out. \"Volcanic Quebracho Tree Trunk, with sap? Fulgrite obsidian made by lightning dragon?! What the heck...\" These materials were once-in-a-lifetime rare and must have been very hard to obtain, to the point where Jun felt guilty about taking the weapon for herself. But the draw of the weapon was so strong she knew she had to have it. Jun seriously, seriously considered stealing it. She looked at the last item, and decided this must have been what ended the quest of the original commissioner of the weapon. \"Blood of red dragon, or mix of fire and dark mage blood.\" Sure enough, there was something else written on the back of the note in a different handwriting.\"My friend died because of this stupid list. F**k you and keep your project.\"...Jun immediately wrote a royal promissory note for half the price of the weapon, seeing as it was technically incomplete, left it on the table, and took the club for herself. She called back to Jill. \"Jill, I don't care how much I have to pay you. You WILL teach me how to use this weapon. It can't be that different from a sword.\"That last ingredient wasn't going to be necessary.
