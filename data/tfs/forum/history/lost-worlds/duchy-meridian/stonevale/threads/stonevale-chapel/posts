Flipping through the worn pages, he settled on one filled with odd, seemingly incomprehensible lines and circles. He once again looked up and around, checking for others. The sanctuary was still empty, but he didn't know if or when someone may come in. Still, satisfied that no one was around, he began reading the page and murmuring to himself.He reached into his alchemy pack as he read and pulled out a miniature vial, an iron nail, and a small pouch. His murmuring grew louder as he stood up, taking his book and his supplies with him, and approached the altar. Setting down the book in front of him, he used the nail to prick his thumb and let the blood flow into the vial. He then took a small pinch of a dark black powder from the pouch and added it to the vial. Raising the mixture to inspect it, he moved it slowly over one of the altar's candles. As the flames licked the glass, the mixture began to shift from a dark crimson to a bright purple, and dark wisps of red smoke began to circle above it. Harlen's voice seemed to shift from a simple recitation to something like a prayer or chant as the smoke swirled around his head and down his coat. Soon the thin veneer of smoke covered his whole body, obscuring his more prominent details. Suddenly, he stopped speaking and drank the vial's contents. The smoke dissipated quickly, and Harlen tucked the various supplies into his jacket. He closed his eyes and let out one last sigh, a thin line of smoke coming out with it. He walked casually back to his seat to pick up his cane and pack, slipping the vial, nail, and pouch back into their case. He seemed much more calm, even happy, and smiled as he walked towards the door. He paused as he passed a polished window. He could see in his reflection two new white streaks in his hair. He groaned, but still smiled. He would deal with that later. He opened the door just as an older woman dressed in commoner's clothes came in, so he kindly held the door for her. As she passed, he looked back at the sanctuary, and almost grimaced, but went right back to smiling. He thought to himself \"I'll never trust these people's gods or spirits. But at least they prove useful.\" And he left.<Exit to The Kings Tankard>", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<Enter from Central Square>"}, "post-2005": {"user": "Arella Hildandi", "user_num": 166, "timestamp": "1430943765000", "message": "<Enter from Camilla's Garden>Arella gently pushed the thick front doors to the chapel open. The interior was dimly lit by candles and dusty light streaming in through colored glass. A serene calm instantly filled her as she slipped inside. Bowing her head, she walked down the center aisle. It was painful in a small way to make the walk, considering how many times she had done it under what ought to have been happier circumstances, but that was then and this is now. She reached the front of the pews and paused before she took a couple more steps to reach the bottom of the shallow stairs that led to the altar. With a deep breath, she gathered her skirt and knelt down on the cold stone. Bending forward so that her forehead almost touched the steps in front of her, she closed her eyes and prayed. Only a few minutes passed, but for her it felt like ages.When she sat up straight again, she found her face covered in salty tears. She wiped them away and stood up, giving a small bow as she moved off to the side where a rack of candles were set up to be lit in prayer. She picked up five of them lighting each in turn and giving a small prayer as she placed it in a holder. She took another few minutes to kneel before the rack of candles and say another few prayers before departing. She walked back up the main aisle, pausing halfway to look around the building. It was beautifully constructed. Part of her wondered where the priest was. She would find him eventually. Considering her ordeals over the past ten years, she had grown very devout as a means of escape.

Bandolier, check. Shiny new weapon, check. Grandma's rig. Check. Rations, check. Medical supplies, check. Map, check. Tampons, check.This was it.\"Hey, Harlen, take good care of them, and yourself, ok?\" Something about actually fighting him mean they had formed a special bond, and Jun knew he was probably the strongest member of their group. She looked around and couldn't help feeling sentimental towards all of them even though they had just met. She also looked towards her own group. She and Camilla had become fast friends, and even though Jill was a weirdo, she sensed there was something about her worth protecting.She wasn't too keen on Asim's apprentice showing up, because the Inquisition still made her nervous. But she figured she'd have to get over her prejudice at some point. The apprentice seemed nice enough.I'll protect them, she thought to herself. I'll protect them all. When Jun thought this she felt a well of dark energy in her heart which none-the-less felt warm and comforting. It was a common misconception that dark energy was about evil, but in fact it simply represented a different side of humanity. People who were consumed by darkness were often passionate, analytical, and determined people who could fight for the side of good if their feelings were motivated as such. A considerable amount of fuel for her grandmother's will actually came from her dark side. Righteous anger was a very powerful thing, and her darkness would ensure that her anger's will would be appeased...The thought of protecting her friends, as cheesy as it sounds, caused Jun's dark side to resonate with her light side, although she didn't realize it just yet.(What she also didn't realize is that some of that energy and will was slowly being leeched into her club. Nearly all the stones had a faint, undetectable glow to them now.)Jun did have one question though:\"Hey, Camilla, what about the last gem? Are we all going to go after it together?\" Jun thought about this with a smile.

There was a young mage, Croeria, who was newly crowned the queen of the Usque. Her ruling was just and fair, for she had the greater good in her interests. As a gift to the new queen, a crown was fashioned, a beautiful twining piece that elves had woven out of gold and perfectly carved, pure of clarity gems... These gems had been borne of different magics from the slaying or maiming of some sentient beings. Croeria did not know this when the gift presented, that the sapphire came from the death of a dragon, or that the ruby came from the feather of a phoenix... She did not know that a unicorn's blood had been needed for the emerald or that the diamond came from the eye of the griffon. Of course, the gems had been plucked away from a group of dark elves, for dark elves and high elves were always at war with one another.This crown that held these harvested jewels was powerful and could control the environment around for miles. Seeing that Croeria only used her own power for the greater good of the land, she was entrusted with this power too. She was instructed never to abuse this power, for she would be turned to stone by the elder of the tribe that presented it to her.Croeria did as she was instructed, and used the crown only for keeping the land lush and green in the summers and springs, and never used the fire element unless times called for it. And thus, the Usque forest, all of it, had thrived.There were many who saw the potential of what this power could do... Some were angered that she only harnessed the magic for keeping a forest green and alive. She could do so much more! She could have all the land to herself! Why is she only interested in keeping one section of the world pristine when there could be something greater??The day came that those who wanted more were destroyed inside by their envy. Armies were sent from the different surrounding kingdoms, some driven by the proclamation that Croeria was greedy and didn't want to share her prosperity, others proclaiming that she was intending to use this against them all. As the castle was stormed by one army after another, Croeria was saddened by what was happening. Surely they could see that harnessing the powers incorrectly could cause havoc in the world!So she took the crown from her head, knowing that she could have used against her enemies to win this fight. She handed it to the only person she would ever trust with this item, someone who was fiercely loyal to her, someone who would never and could never harness such power in the manner it was coveted for. Her daughter. \"Take it and go... Run, daughter, for you will be in great danger!\"The daughter did as she was told, only looking back with a solemn nod to her mother, for something told her that this would be the end. The young princess disguised herself as a peasant boy and left through the tunnels, and would not stop until she was well hidden where she knew nobody would find her. It was then that she saw the wisdom in melting the crown down and sending the jewels to different locations on the map in secret.While the daughter was escaping, Croeria moved to stand on the balcony overlooking the fighting men and women. She raised her voice as loud as she could, \"STOP! BE STILL!\" Her voice was barely audible over the agonized screams and clashing of metal, but she said it again until her voice grew hoarse with the yelling. She used all of what she had in her, casting a spell behind the words for the sake of simply attracting the attention of the greed driven armies below. When they all stilled and silenced, one by one, and all turning as if one unit to look at the pale figure high above, she spoke... \"Why are you doing this?\" Her voice, though haggard, was loud and commanding... \"Don't you see what this has done to you? That you want what you should not have and you are seeking to kill for it? You're all too late, I've destroyed the crown.\" And she would toss down the remnants of something else altogether, shards that resembled what used to be gems and lumps of what looked like melted down gold, all made so by illusion. \"No more! It is gone! Now get thee away!\"Anger and disbelief swept through the crowd. How could it be? This fight was all for naught?The sound of a lone bowstring creaked loudly, and kerthunked... It was accompanied by a yell of pure rage, \"YOU BITCH! DEATH BE UNTO YOU!!!\" The single arrow missed, and Croeria fled out of the line of fire...For three days and nights, the battle raged on violently throughout the land, while her daughter slipped further and further away from the madness. She hid in a cave at one point, and pried all the gems from their mountings, desperate to get the deed done before someone knew that she was holding the item. The four gems tinked to the cave floor and she set about building the hottest fire she could, casting the crown itself in so it would melt away. Her journey from there had her burying the gems out of sight.The last gem was sewn into the hem of her skirt, and she fled the main land for parts unknown. Nobody knows what happened from there, only that the young princess disappeared and would never be seen again. As for Croeria, she had died a slow and painful death... First tortured, then drawn and quartered alive.
