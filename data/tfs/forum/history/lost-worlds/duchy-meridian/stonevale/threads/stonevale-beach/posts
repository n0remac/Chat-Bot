Now, an adult 60 ft tall and competent in his use of magic, Trogdor returned for revenge.  The humans, naive to their puniness, had started wars over land and wealth, attempting to claim it all for their selves.  The dragons during that time, being religious fools, had tried to keep the peace.  Then, instead of truly fighting when the humans turned on them, the dragons had fled the land because it was the will of Lo.  What nonsense. Trogdor would teach the puny humans a lesson.  He would show them which race was the strongest and deserved to rule.  He would bath the cities of man in fire and burninate the country side.  Soon his brethren would follow him across the seas and join him...then the Age of Dragons would begin.Ahead and below him the land was coming into sight.  The city of Stonevale sat on the coast waiting for him.  Tired after his long flight Trogdor did not have the energy to ravish the city, but he could give them a taste of his power and make his demands.  Beginning to fly in a spiral Trogdor drew upon his mana source.  He summoned the winds to his body and started to form a tornado.  The viscous winds would soon suck up the ocean starting a water cyclone.  Trogdor had used much of him mana in the flight and thus was not capable of summoning a full hurricane, but that would come later.

This combined with his lust for power gave birth to a new well of mana inside him; wrathful magic that could only be used to destroy.  Using this source would drive Trogdor mad.  Drawing deeply from this new found evil power Trogdor sucked in air and bellowed a roar that came out in the form of a black wind.  Really it was more of an anguished shriek of a shattered soul.

In a rather offhanded motion his left hand, driven by a flicking flourish, swept upwards with fingers splayed to present his palm to the standoffish beast--and the palm was bare, the fabric of the glove  cut away there and at the tip of each spindly digit.
