There simply haven\u2019t been very many officers to whom I would entrust a thousand lives, much less outcome of a major battle. \u2026 Hence my presence here,\u201d She gestures to the maps around them, referring to how she is present to direct these activities herself.\u201cAs such, I would be pleased to employ you, but do understand my unwillingness to take your word at face value, give you a uniform, and set you off with a legion to do as you please. Instead, what we will do is this: You will speak with someone. Some officer of mine, perhaps, and they will question you. You will tell them all that you know, possibly over the course of multiple sessions, and I will learn of your experiences serving Goraia, your qualifications, and other such details.\u201d\u201cYou will not be a prisoner, and your needs will be seen to, but I will attach to you a guard. You will be free to roam the city, travel and do as you wish within reason- with the guard. I understand you have a \u201cprestigious household,\u201d and once it has been inspected, you will be free to visit. Then, you and I will meet in perhaps two weeks\u2019 time. By then, the dust will have hopefully settled here in Stonevale. My men will have had a chance to evaluate your men, and I will have more information and more time, such that we will hopefully be able to discuss details of your employment.\u201d", "link_list": ["/post/65272/thread", "/user/1110"], "image_list": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zfgZpFx6Sbg/T84lA6tIKSI/AAAAAAAAACM/ntCfy7PRJVo/s1600/sword+rose.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@dantessvisconti\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/65272/thread\" timestamp=\"1493844875\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-1110\" title=\"Dantess Visconti\"><img alt=\"Dantess Visconti Avatar\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zfgZpFx6Sbg/T84lA6tIKSI/AAAAAAAAACM/ntCfy7PRJVo/s1600/sword+rose.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/65272/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1493844875000\" title=\"May 3, 2017 12:54:35 GMT -8\">May 3, 2017 12:54:35 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-1110 group-0\" href=\"/user/1110\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@dantessvisconti\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Dantess Visconti</span></a></span> said:</div>\u00a0 \u00a0 \"<i>Well</i>, I most certainly have no qualms with cooperation..\" he said, a much more business-like tone taking over his mannerisms as the introductions came to an end.
