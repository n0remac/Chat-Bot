It seems that whenever dusk rolls around weary travelers will find this inn, or perhaps there is just many branches of the inn owned by the same family. Whenever someone visits the layout is always slightly different, the proprietor may be the same person each time or simply a close relative, the only consistency is the menu. The inn could be magical or it could simply be coincidence, but it is always there for those who need it.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://pre13.deviantart.net/0308/th/pre/f/2015/044/6/e/houseofnotomorrow___chrisostrowski_1600w_by_najtkriss-d8hsp54.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://pre13.deviantart.net/0308/th/pre/f/2015/044/6/e/houseofnotomorrow___chrisostrowski_1600w_by_najtkriss-d8hsp54.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}, "post-20387": {"user": "Hiyama", "user_num": 192, "timestamp": "1451863789000", "message": "A young man, wrapped in what appeared to be a large cloak of straw, entered the inn from the frigid winter cold.
