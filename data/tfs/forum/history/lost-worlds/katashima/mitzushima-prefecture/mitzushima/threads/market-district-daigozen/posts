Raw goods from all over the country can be found here, from ore to lumber to silk, to spices and dyes and exotic animals -- as pet or food!The buildings are all crowded and close together, and the bright colors of merchants trying to attract your eye all blend into one magnificent rainbow. Here you can buy food from stalls or dingy diners, sample rice wine made by amateurs trying to make their way, or a more illegal drink that will make you see spirits.Cheap and dirty hostels and diners are located here, as well as whores if you can't afford the more beautiful women of Yakahira.

He was completely unaware of the Shiniga samurai-spy. He enjoyed the more 'practical' regions of the city, away from the grandiose that was the palace.

There were goods of every kind, from all over Katashima, and Kenjin perused some of the wares, if only a little. He did not have a need for such things at the moment. He did, however, question the availability of lumber and ore being shipped to the Uesung Province; this market would provide him with the materials needed to restore his land.Kenjin expressed a large distaste for the prostitutes. He did not like the idea of women taking up such a degenerate role in society. \"Disgusting,\" he said under his breath, snarling his lips and looking away. Kenjin held a high opinion of all women, and vowed to himself that, one day, he would treat them with as much respect as he could.The true reason Kenjin was here, however, was to inquire about some things in Katashima. Surely the Shiniga Clan samurai-spy would hear him, and should definitely question Kenjin's intentions, especially if he was asking about Yanata help. \"Excuse me, sir\" Kenjin approached a Katashiman traveler, \"how lenient is the Yanata clan? Are they generous?\"", "link_list": ["/user/959"], "image_list": [], "html": "On his way out of the palace, Kenjin decided to visit the market district, or Daigozen.
