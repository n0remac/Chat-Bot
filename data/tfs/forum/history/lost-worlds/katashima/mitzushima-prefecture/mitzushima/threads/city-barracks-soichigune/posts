A fine name he thought, chosen by the Empress herself; the Hyaku Eiko... Surely a name that would be remembered for a thousand years.And Akira would be remembered as the man who first led it. The first and finest commander. The man who led them into battle as many times as he was required, yet never lost one. He could just imagine the tales that would be told... But for now, he had to create that army. He could not get ahead of himself too soon - it was a dangerous thing to be caught up in glory that was not yet his.He stepped out of his office building and into the courtyard, where the hundreds of potential candidates had arrived in the barracks and stood to wait instruction. They were men of all shapes and sizes; some were little more than children, others seasoned veterans made clear through their scars. Akira marched in front of them; silent, eyes piercing like an eagle's as he looked for weakness and disease. He would pick only the strongest, only the men who stood with the conviction of a trained samurai, only the men who weren't afraid to look him in the eyes to join the trials.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "After his secret meetings with the Empress, Akira was now back in the Soichigune and running day-to-day operations of the Glorious Hundred.

He was casually leaning against a column facing the crowds. Tables had been set up by his men, with scrolls and brushes of ink on each and every one.

If they were younger than 17, they were out. If they were older than 30, they were out. If they served certain daimyo lords, they were out. And all of the names would be investigated during their time at bootcamp, and if lies, scandal, or any untoward news about an individual was discovered at that time, they were out.She wanted absolute loyalty to her. Not any loyalty that could be divided between herself and a samurai lord. Loyalty to her, and her alone. So for this reason, any ronin that wanted to join would be investigated thoroughly... and no samurai that held any allegiance to any clan would be accepted.Sano took out a knife and begun to slice into a plum, glancing up when Akira made his way out. He had already spotted the samurai that came in. For all that they dressed like peasants, they held themselves like lords and were easily picked out. For a moment, Sano wondered what the point was of even trying to blend in.Then again, Sano figured that they should have expected this.\"You're in for a long day, Captain,\" Sano said jovially from Akira's left.
