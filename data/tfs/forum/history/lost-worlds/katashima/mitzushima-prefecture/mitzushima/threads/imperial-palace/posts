He showed none of the lack of decorum that the city guard had shown. Indeed, he was straight faced and carried himself with a confidence begat from a man with experience in martial affairs.Once they were handed to him and he read over them, he nodded and lead them through the gates and into the Grand Courtyard. Down twenty one shallow steps they walked, and then onto a red stone path towards one of the taller buildings of the ornate complex. Banners of the Imperial Family were wafting in the breeze, and huge stone statues lined the thick walk way towards another set of stairs that led upwards. To both the left and the right were blossoming trees that appeared to be sakura, but the leaves and the buds were far too red. They were set within a stone circle, and around that stone circle were ponds filled with large, thick, slow-moving koi that swam beneath floating waterlilies.Up the steps they went, but instead of through the ornate doors that were framed between blood red pillars, the soldier turned left and walked around the building and towards a side entrance of an ornately painted silk screen. He bowed, and spoke quietly to the screen, although there appeared no one there to hear him.Even so, the murmured words had the screen sliding back, and a beautiful woman bowed to the man on the other side. Her dark eyes glanced briefly into the face of Kenjin and gave a small, flirtatious smile, and then they glanced to the Shiniga Samurai accompanying him. She frowned. Openly.\"This way,\" she said to them, and led them into the building. Through a series of wooden-lined walks they went, and much of where they went, bird song seemed to follow. By the time they had gotten to a place, it was at the back south garden and they were led to a pagoda.The Empress was sat there, a desk at its center, and gold gleamed in her hair, at her ears, at her throat. The young woman's lashes were downcast, watching her hand that seemed to languidly twirl and roam over the scroll she was painting on.

Her brush stroked with precision and effortless talent over the scroll, and she did not look up while Kenjin spoke.And spoke, and spoke. Finally, her hand went still, and she raised her eyes from her scroll to the sword that was being offered to her.\"Do not give that sword into my care,\" the Empress spoke, her voice calm and quiet and serious, the first words she ever spoke to Kenjin, \"or I will order it destroyed.\"She set her brush to the side, then reached for a cloth that was kept damp and wiped her fingers upon it. The black and deep, deep pink she was using for her painting were smeared onto the cloth, and still stained her slender, ivory fingertips. Her gaze was on her hands, and not yet on Kenjin.\"If I believed that the sins of the father carry onto the child, I would not be Empress,\" she spoke. \"Even so, my father's legacy was in wiping out the Uesung Clan, and the Uesung Clan has a notorious history for unspeakable cruelty and evil.\"She finally lifted her dark gaze to look across the way at the white-draped Kenjin Uesung. The Empress was beautiful, but there were many beautiful women in Katashima. What made the Empress stand out was that she carried herself entirely as if she deserved to be an Empress; there was a confidence and political wisdom that defied her age, easily sensed in the way she held her elegant shoulders, in the somewhat haughty tip of her chin, and the direct, piercing gaze of her dark eyes.\"It also does not please me that you seek to hold a monopoly on all grown food in Katashima. After all, money only makes a man wealthy. Resources makes a man powerful.\"She reached for a little shovel of a pot of sand, and she began to pour it over her work, effectively drying the ink and picking up whatever was left over so that it would not smear. Her gaze was once more on her task.\"I will not pardon the members of the Uesung Clan that still live and rally to your cause. They are criminals, and they have lost all honor. I can say with most deep assurance that if they ever step foot in the open in Katashima, one, or all, of the daimyo will make it their prerogative to kill them.\"She lifted her scroll out of the sand, and then she gave it to Kenjin.\"In short, Uesung Kenjin, you have set yourself up for an impossible task.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/7d/f6/08/7df608e883cc9fd59571fd3cc198aeef.jpg"], "html": "The woman that he first encountered behind the screen was only a servant who led Kenjin towards the Empress, so when he began speaking in earnest to her, the woman merely glanced over her shoulder with an incredulous look and then hurried to take the talking man towards the Empress."}, "post-19634": {"user": "Shiniga Clan", "user_num": 959, "timestamp": "1450968720000", "message": "The samurai were definitely on watch at this point.
