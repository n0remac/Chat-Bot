Still, just as he served the Empress, he had loyal Samurai retainers who in turn served him; accompanying him almost everywhere as a force of bodyguards and personal attendants. The road in Aokikawa forest was silent in the night. The moon could not shine it's brilliant light through the leaves of the trees, leaving it near perpetual darkness and Narigata's men screening his horse with lit torches. Their business? Who knew. They were leaving Mitzushima however and their time of departure was nothing if not suspicious. They were all silent, moving at the pace of a brisk walk, yet fully and keenly concentrated on their surroundings in borderline paranoia. They clearly expected someone to encounter them, or something to happen to them. It was then, from the branches above, that a small pellet was thrown down directly in front of Narigata's horse. Immediately, the Samurai drew weapons and Narigata braced his eyes, prepared for a screen of smoke to suddenly spout from what was obviously a primitive tool of distraction. However, the smoke never came and while Narigata covered his eyes, a thrown knife flew straight for his throat. Within an instant, one of his guards had beaten it out of the air with the back of his sword. \"Over there!\" One of them yelled, nodding towards the trees where a shadowy figure passed through torchlight and behind a trunk at the side of the road, then began running back towards their rear. Another knife was thrown, yet this one was aimed for one of the nine guards and pierced his arm with a thud. \"Scoundrel! Show yourself!\" Another yelled, followed by a second shout of agreement, then a third. The assailant complied. Dressed from head to toe in black, there were none in Katashima who would recognize the man, though when he drew from behind him a white tengu mask and placed it over his already covered face, a certain few might. He stepped out from the trees, a ninjato katana in one hand as he slowly walked around to the front of the small column.\"Amana Narigata,\" the man spoke, his voice shrouded by the mask that covered his lips. \"Your life ends tonight.\"There was a pause, but soon after the Samurai and even Narigata himself began to laugh. \"Ninja, there are ten of us and your trap has failed. If anyone is to die tonight,\" the lord said, \"it will be you.\"The ninja flicked his hand upwards, but the knife that flew from it would miss it's target once again. A samurai, ever-loyal, darted in front of his lord and deflected it with his blade once more. Meanwhile, the man in the tengu mask reached down for more blades.\"Quickly! Form a screen in front of our lord! Deflect the knives!\" One of the lead Samurai yelled, as quickly the others moved from their positions around the horse to form a line in front of him. \"Do not let him pass!\"The ninja looked at them, eyes scanning their bodies and footwork cautiously, before making his next and final move. Two knives were thrown, one right after the other. The first, rather than aiming for his target, seemed to be aimed at the Samurai himself. The second was for the same target, yet aimed lower - for his legs. But the Samurai was trained. He saw through tactic quickly, effortlessly raising his sword to block the first and then moving his leg to avoid the second.Suddenly, the knife hit the previously dropped pellet and the area filled with smoke to burn unguarded eyes and claw at unprotected throats.

There were only five of them, not counting the one who had shown himself, yet their plan would be executed with perfection. The thrown knives had drawn all the Samurai to the front of their mounted lords, while the previously placed pellet had been activated by the trauma of the knife and sprayed smoke to blind them. Now blind, now deaf, the Samurai were like helpless children when the others leapt in from behind. Narigata was killed instantly as the other four rushed in to kill each two of their enemy, leaving nine dead and one remaining. The last, the tenth, had his throat slashed by the man in the tengu mask who rushed in from the front. Then, just like that, it was over. The others disappeared into the trees, the man in the mask dropped a note, then turned and followed them. The note read:\"Citizens of Katashima. This man, the Samurai known as Amana Narigata, lied, bribed and murdered his way into power. His punishment was just and deserved and his men died trying to protect him. For too long has our land been ruled by the power-hungry Daimyo, the violent Samurai and their Imperial overlords. We will strike again, and again, until our land is free from these menaces. We have the support of the people. We have the armaments, the skills, the dedication and the training. We have the cover of the night and the layabout of the land. We are amongst you and you amongst us, yet you will never know it.
