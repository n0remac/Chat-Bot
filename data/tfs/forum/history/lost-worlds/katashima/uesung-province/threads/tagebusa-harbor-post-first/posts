His people would look to him like a father rather than a leader.Raynor beckoned to his attendants to start unloading the equipment. There was one particular item that they might have trouble with, a large wildebeest with brown stripes named Sasha. She was somewhat temperamental, though trained to keep her temper in check. Raynor was the only human she really liked. The creature would groan angrily as the peasants and crew tried to convince it to move. The Land-Tillers knew well enough to at least try baiting her with food.As for Raynor, she looked at the young woman endearingly. \"Let's just say we're glad to be on land. We don't sail very often, even by mainland standards.\" He bowed his head slightly. He decided not to beckon for a hand-shake since the head bow was a more universally accepted greeting. \"There was a terrible amount of mist on the open ocean as well, and a few of my people became sea sick. Katashima may as well be heaven right now!\" Raynor's eyes went up and down the girl's armor. She looked like a fighter. He liked women fighters and perhaps it was obvious in his smile. \"Forgive me for saying so, but you look very much like my daughter. It's good to see Katashima respects its women by allowing them to train in combat.
