There, in the shadows of the night, there walks a man.  The other ronin all prop or stand up, looking at the figure as he comes into the fire's light.\"No need to be alarmed,\" the figure says.  He is dressed in white robes and traditional samurai armor.  Judging by his appearance, he is no ronin and exhibits the appearance of a well-trained warrior.\"Who are you,\" commands a bald-headed samurai, one of the oldest out of the group.  \"Speak now, or my brothers shall strike you down where you stand.\"The figure walks closer, where he is clearly visible.  He says nothing, only draws the odachi which is slung over his back.  He pulls it out slowly so as to let the ronin anticipate its full length.Disbelief covers the ronins faces, there hands coming off of the grips of their own blades.  Eyes widen and mouths drop as they realize what it is.  \"No... it can't be!  Is that... \"\"Yes,\" the figure says, clasping the hilt in both hands.  \"It is I, Kenjin Uesung, son of Kagen Uesung, and rightful heir of this province!  And I have come here to reclaim what is rightfully mine!\"Some of the ronin cry, some of them laugh in joy, but they all fall to their knees - either out of joyful-weakness or respect.  They bow before him, pledging their loyalty.  It is a small band, but a loyal band - a happy band.  They know this man speaks the truth, for he wields the Tachi no Akuma.\"You bow as ronin, but you shall stand as samurai.  Now, stand before me, and let me see your faces, for I aim to know the people who serve me.\"The ronin - no, samurai - will sleep good tonight.\u00a0 Their lord, Kenjin Uesung, will sleep with them, protected by his newly-acquired retainers.[Exit to the Main Gate]", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1032/post-first-main-gate?page=1&scrollTo=19372"], "image_list": [], "html": "At least a dozen warriors sit quietly around a camp fire in the still of night.
