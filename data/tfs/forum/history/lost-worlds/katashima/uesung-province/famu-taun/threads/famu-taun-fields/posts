They are dressed in relatively plain leathers and furs. However, as they begin to spread their scrolls onto the field, their eyes begin to grow a light green and they start muttering to themselves in an unknown language. The scrolls are covered in runes and diagrams, which also start to glow.Raynor looks optimistic when the scrolls start to project images into the air, like holograms. They reveal more runes and diagrams.\"Plenty of water, low calcium content... bad for thick greens... Kaolinite... well we are near a river... could use more potassium and nitrogren...\"Raynor himself reaches into the soil and examines it. He spots a small black beetle with brown wing covers and a greenish shine. \"Hmm... these could be a problem.\"The farming mage girls turn back to Raynor. \"Root vegetables, grapes, chives?\" Raynor nods and responds back. \"And chamomile. We need something that can repel these little guys and the chives may not do it.\" He himself steps out into the field. He raises his staff. \"Earth Art: Gaia Blessing!\"A green pulse erupts from Raynor's feet and spreads out onto the field. He looked back towards the scrolls' images. The diagrams changed slightly. \"Perfect. Go, go go.\" His other men reach forward with hardwood, stone, and iron tools and begin breaking up the soil. An attended of Sasha the wildebeest walks next to Raynor. \"Elder, that section of the field.\" Raynor nods. \"Go.\" The man grabs a large plow from a cart and wheels it over to him. The man pulls on Sasha's harness. \"Come on you stubborn old lady.\" Sasha groans but complies.Raynor turns to Kenjin. \"This field is a perfect candidate for companion planting. You can plant multiple crops here, and they will support each other and help each other grow. However you will have to pay special attention to the fertilizer. My spell will wear off eventually.\"Raynor pulls out a rock from his pocket and shows it to Kenjin. \"This is a useful mineral if you can find it. Grind it into your fertilizer. If you've had no prior use for it it should be quite cheap.\"\"And if you can't find it, the ash of certain types of wood and plants will make a good substitute.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQSWznPrfyN4BzCbIn2iLhoRiz6bqyE60bgqaE7m0-Mt7h56z5E", "http://www.goodwriting.ninja/engineering/appendix-b/images/Potash.jpg"], "html": "Raynor cracks his knuckles and cries out to his people. \"Ok, let's start with a soil analysis!\""}}
