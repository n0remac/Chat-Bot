From this perch, one could see the goings-on down below.  She would be able to see every ship that came in or out of the area.  A few ashigaru guards stood watch on the balcony, but at the flick of her wrist, Kitsu sent them back indoors.\"I am glad, Land Tiller, that you see equality in both genders.  My father was a great samurai who fought for Kagen Uesung.\"  Kitsu looked at Raynor, but figured he did not know the tyrant, Kagen.  \"Ladies like myself generally opt out of combative training, but my father felt it necessary to train me, lest some man abuse me in some way when he married me off.  Fortunately for my father - and my suitors, I never married.\"A young man came onto the balcony and served tea.  It would be good tea, as Kitsu only ordered the very best from the capital.  It was offered to Raynor.  \"You would like Kenjin.  He holds a very high standard for all women, and through him we will become empowered.  Even now, he has put me in charge of erecting spiritual and recreational buildings specifically for women.  He is... obsessed with them, but not in a terrible way.  He is a good man, a man who treats all women as goddesses.  The man is a virgin, and perhaps will always be, because he is so devoted to women.\"The woman was clearly hiding something.  Was it a dark secret?  Did she have her own agenda separate from Kenjin?  Perhaps she was infatuated with Kenjin, and sought to twist him in a way that would make him marry her?  She was a very hard woman to read.\"So Land Tiller, let's talk business.  Did you bring the necessary items to help Kenjin's folk learn to farm more effectively?  Seeds, tools, perhaps specific talents for them to know?  If so, please, do tell.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The achigaru guards who patrolled the estate quickly opened the large wooden doors for Kitsu and Raynor and anyone who may have attended them."}, "post-20149": {"user": "Raynor of the Celadine", "user_num": 150, "timestamp": "1451531716000", "message": "Raynor felt a chill go up his spine. Much of what she said simply felt awkward. Marrying her off? A virgin for being devoted to women? And was spousal abuse so ubiquitous in this land?

Sure, men and women made fun of each other sometimes, but that was as far as the battle of the sexes extended.The view was beautiful, and he could see his boat was being treated well. The poor wildebeest Sasha must have finally given up being so stubborn.He simply nodded away everything the young woman said. \"I... suppose every culture grows at its own pace. Kenjin sounds like a good man.\" His intuition wasn't actually very good, mostly because he made a conscious effort to try to see the best in people. But even his thickheaded-ness could sense something was amiss. He figured he'd give her the benefit of the doubt.\"Business, of course. And please, call me Raynor, or Elder, unless you want me to call you Katashiman.\" He smirked, but his eyes pierced into her. \"We basically brought all the knowledge we have... although those scrolls will have to be translated to your language. And yes, we also have seeds and soil samples, and crops we figured might do well in this region. But we also need to study your current methods, and get to know your ecology, lest we accidentally cause damage to your ecosystem. You might be surprised to learn that what we are undertaking is actually quite dangerous, though if done with patience and prudence can be a great boon to your land. And of course, we offer our manpower. Speaking of which...\"He leaned in closer to Kitsu and spoke into her ear. \"There are women among my attendants, and they are not used to being viewed as inferior.
