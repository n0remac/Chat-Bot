Ryuk would sit on one of these pillows. On the walls were paintings of farms, mountains, and two beautiful illustrations of the Black Fox and the White Fox, two Shinigami that the Shiniga recognize as deities. \"Please, sit! Mother should be here soon for dinner. Please do not mind her, she can be a little... crazy at times. Ever since Father died, she has been scared that I am the last of their blood.

Makoto pouted before she took a deep breath to find her bearings again, having Shin in front of her would guide her in all of the necessary customs she would need to display to be apart of the clan, and she knew it was not going to come to her naturally--she was a country girl after all and far different from having any education what so ever. Following a set of wooden stairs, the structure was build so soundly none of the steps creaked, at least that is what Shin noticed as he admired the architecture for a second.Shin looked over to the fox illustrations on the wall, his fox-faced expression only widened as he turned to follow Ryuk's direct instructions, he motioned over to the dinning table across from Ryuk. The katana remained on his back as he knelled over a black cushion and removed his gloves, this was the only time he would ever remove them, and it revealed several scars between his fingers. While the rest of his hands were normal it was as an indication that he had years of training with a blade and he managed to keep all his fingers in the end. Everything about his person was left on from the aviator hat with goggles to the leather satchel, being a foreigner most likely excused his appearance which he had no intention of changing, and even if it was offered he would respectfully decline with proper explanation.Makoto had to remove the Naginata from her back in order to kneel again which she carefully set behind the cushions at first but she realized it was in the way there so she slide it under the long table concealing it entirely--as she did this Shin stared at her she shrug her shoulders as sat on a cushion across from Ryuk as well. Just as instructed she nodded in agreement as if she were practicing being at the dinner table near Ryuk's mother whenever she joined them. As silence filled the room she disturbed it by fidgeting from where she sat, pulling the long black bangs that framed her face carefully behind her ear revealing her sun kissed face, as the lighting of the dinning room flickered from the candle light she darted her black eyes around the room.\"This is the biggest home I have ever been in...even though my family kept a house for many generations it was never expanded.

But even such an abode is a joke to the Empress's home. That is a big home.\" Ryuk spoke to Makoto before turning to the servants who entered the room.The two women who entered were dressed in black lace dress that covered 90% of her body. Despite being seethrough, the dress did block out specific regions on the body. Their hair was jet black and pulled back into a ponytail that nearly touched the floor had it not been for the bun on the back of her head that held much of her hair. Their eyes were green and their skin was pale. On their backs were large fans that were folded up. All in all, they were intimidating and beautiful looking woman who were practically twins.These two women set three bowls on the table. Inside the bowls was water with cherry blossom petals that continuously swirled despite the still water. In the middle of the water was a floating candle that burned with a black fire. When the candles were lit, the eyes on the drawings on the wall began to look alive. It was an illusion created by the chemicals from the black fire and the material and ink for the eyes, a natural occurrence, but even the Shiniga didn't know this and thought the Shinigami were actually there, watching them.After setting the table, they would leave the room, and Ryuk looked to Shin and Makoto, \"I've got a question for you two. If you were the Emperor or Empress, what would you do for the farmlands and the lands that are outside the main lands? The only way I know how to help someone is to know what their needs are. So what are some things you would introduce to your people if you could?\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"The Shiniga have earned this home.

Nakazawa had every right to suspect him, most people judged books by its cover, and Shin had an appearance of foreigner and his fox-like facial expression hid too many secrets. With a simple nod he acknowledged the noble woman just as instructed. The Daimyo's question was quite alarming, it was against the nature of any citizen to ponder the inner workings of an empire, even if it was hypothetical it would go against everything Shin stood for, especially since he was no scholar to have an opinion in politics. The moment Shin parted his lips to finally answer it was Makoto that replied, she did not know better, and that was made clear even after she nodded at Ryuk's mother to acknowledge the question her son had asked before her arrival.\"If I were in that position I would establish a proper trading system. Most of the grain we grow is sold and we get to keep very little of the supply ourselves. Various food supplies provide a well balanced diet for the people. The money is used to buy the basics to live, textiles, candles, tools, live stock...it is an endless cycle but it is not enough to feed the children...our future.\" Makoto had way too many wild ideas, she was like an animal herself, she acted on emotions but in the end she was nurturing and she had determined that the people really needed a better system that would be fair.\"I would never dare assume such a high position no matter what the circumstances. Who am I to have an opinion, in order to improve society I must start with myself, and only then would I be able to make something of myself.\" Shin answered shortly after hoping to dissolve any ideas that were more reserved for scholars and people of power.Makoto was stunned, she understood everything Shin had said, and she realized her complaints had no merit with everyone present. It was agreeable to first improve oneself in order to aid others, that was the main reason she wanted to be a part of the Shiniga clan, and she was feeling a bit resentful for having any opinion at all about the Empire. The more she thought about it carefully the lower her she held her head, the bangs that framed her face fell forward as she sulked, and she sighed softly feeling disappointed in herself.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "In an empire where everything was short of perfection, it would take years to make any improvements, everything had a balance or circumstance that would affect an individual or society.
