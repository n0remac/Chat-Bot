Ryuk knew the girl meant no harm, but his Samurai took no chances. Ryuk would nod to the Samurai, letting the Samurai know the girl was fine and meant no harm.Ryuk looked at the young girl, \"You need to decide where your loyalty lies. If you wish for the Shiniga to teach you, you will not just jump to the servitude of another. There's no problem with helping, but nobody knows the Uesung like the Shiniga... He speaks of good things, but ask him to explain his weapon, and you will see more clearly. There is Righteousness among the Shinigami as there is Honor among Man. What he serves is a Shinigami of unjustified greedy Death, while the Shinigami of the Rakka Hoshi take as they need with no preference. He forgets, despite our clans fighting against each other, before that, the Shiniga and Uesung worked together; we have copies of every scroll written by the two and all Shiniga are required to read every scroll and be knowledgeable of their history, making sure they don't make the same mistakes as their ancestors.\"And then there was Kenjin, who Ryuk looked back at and began to speak in his lifeless voice, his anger barely noticeable, \"First, Kenjin Uesung, you are no Daimyo. Daimyo is earned, not given. Second, not even the Empress tends to speaks before I am ready, much less you; we can forgive this once, but should it ever happen again, your tongue will be removed from your head. I am a Daimyo and you will respect me as such, Samurai. As for the message from the Empress, who are you to deliver such? Does the Empress think words from your mouth amount to anything towards me?\" Daimyo Ryuk spoke, as if trying to plant a false sense of mistrust between Ryuk and the Empress. Daimy Ryuk slightly smirked before he got to his next point, \"My Samurai have already told me of these boundaries. Do you think that's the first time she has said such? What she fails to explain is the many times I have had people people in shadows or as escorts  that have saved lives. What she fails to see herself is that such an image shows unity under the Empress, that we are all one. So keep in mind, what relationship is between myself and the Empress is nigh understandable among others; do not ever try to use her words to demean me among company again, you may lose your tongue if it ever happens.\"Ryuk would close his eyes and take a deep breathe, this was the topic that angered him, \"If you think I will let you receive the title of Daimyo without fighting for it yourself, you are wrong. A Daimyo is a leader who has fought himself, with what he has, no matter the odds, and prevails...Your family, I care nothing about. As for the Yanata, if you value the Empress, you will speak none to them. The moment you ally with them, you become an enemy. Although the Empress thinks they will remain a Province under her, I do not see it happening. They wouldn't be an enemy, but I, myself, would not allow such lands to be controlled by them for anything...Samurai, if you can make it worth the Shiniga to involve themselves, now is the time. Under no other circumstances would I allow such, but this world is becoming more political, and the Shiniga need to be more open. Even being open, there's only two ways this is ending, and it's all up to you...\" Ryuk ended his response to Uesung, leaving the decision of how bad he wanted the help and how he could make it worth the Shiniga all up to him; let's hope Kenjin has a good sales pitch.And then a Samurai stepped in with a three foot long, mahogany, pipe. The pipe had Shiniga artwork all over it and etched with precision. Ryuk would accept the pipe and the Samurai set a small bowl of fire between the group. Ryuk held the pipe over the over the flame for a minute, letting a glass coating be revealed at the base. The smell of a cherry began to rise from the end of the pipe. What was in it was starting to slowly steam, thus the smell. When the vapor was seen, Ryuk took a draw as he lowered the pipe further into the flame. His right index finger covered a small hole.\u00a0Ryuk would release the vapor like smoke and inhale it French style(through his nostrils). The remainder of the vapor would crawl across his skin, revealing a slight shine in his skin tone. While doing such, he was passing the pipe to Shin.

There were other factors for a foreigner like Shin to be here and he was determined to learn more of the Shiniga in order to excel his own prowess as a warrior.  The room smelled of cherries as Ryuk breathed an herbal mixture through a pipe and handed it over in front of Shin gesturing for him to follow suit. \u201cYou may call me Shin, it brings me great pleasure to be in your presence Daimyo Ryuk.\u201d Shin spoke eloquently and clearly despite his obvious lineage from a foreign land; if it was not for his appearance he would have been mistaken for someone who had a title but it was apparent he had none since he only offered one name. With a slight bow he accepted the master\u2019s offer of the pipe taking it with both hands with precise hand movements slowly turning it at an angle before he inhaled a puff of the herbs, he held on to the smoke within his lungs, and blew out a series of rings made of smoke with his lips until all of it escaped. His fox-faced expression remained the same and the only time it had changed was when Makoto was apprehended but he made sure he continued to retain his composure this entire time. Shin placed the pipe back down allowing it rest on a wooden rest as he would do with a pair of chopsticks and slightly bowed once again to prove his appreciation of being able to share refined herbs with the Daimyo.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The moment the Samurai gripped her hand she tensed up, years of physical training and working the farm line was kicking in, an ominous aura surrounded her but before she could act with her hidden power she hiccuped from being surprised just seconds ago; it was a delayed response. Kenjin ignored her for the most part which made her puff her cheek in disappointment since he was not willing to accept her offer which she thought was generous since he needed help. Ryuk did not see it this way, not only did she deliberately speak out of turn in someone else\u2019s home, she was a bit wild allowing her character to represent her obvious weakness. Makoto lacked education she was not familiar with politics and she especially lacked manners but it was evident that there was something special about her that was hidden deep inside her soul; with training she would be able to harness that special ability and prove to be more useful."}, "post-19910": {"user": "Daimyo Ryuk-Rakka Hoshi no Ken", "user_num": 942, "timestamp": "1451271379000", "message": "Ryuk never looked at Kenjin.

I must apologize for such a scene. It is not normal that the Shiniga have guests like that.

Nothing is perfect, we are human. People are struggling and so am I.\u201d Shin\u2019s expression was still the same, \u201cHalf of my roots have brought me here to the family that I lost when my mother left by ship to arrive at a foreign country before I was born. Dreadful place really, theair is filled in soot, and ground is always covered in snow.  I returned to this land 15 years ago, watched my family lose their land and everything they worked hard for. I wish to do something to regain the honor of my family.\u201d He lowered his head to showcase how ashamed he felt in being unable to meet this goal yet.\u201cI am here so I can help feed all the orphans in my village\u2026\u201d Makoto said on the verge of tears, \u201cAll the food we grow has to be sold just to maintain the upkeep of the farm land. The children are starving and I must do something to feed them all\u2026my grandfather is the leader there, the people are too busy with the farms, and I share all my food with the orphans. I left so that my portion could be given to them\u2026at the same time I want to make the Empire a better place even if I can help just a little bit.\u201d At that point her stomach growled, just talking about food made her hungry, it was true that her family was well off but she made it her responsibility to take in abandoned children into her home. Most people took in a stray animal but she took on children that passerby\u2019s down the main road tend to give her. Makoto hard swallowed the lump in her throat as she tried very hard to hide that she was famished. \"Let go of me already! My arm is falling asleep!\" Makoto pleaded with the samurai who had not yet released her hand until she thought of what other reasons he would have to detain her, \"Alright! I confess!

One day we will have our chance to make the change and bring Katashima together for all the lands to prosper, not just a few.
