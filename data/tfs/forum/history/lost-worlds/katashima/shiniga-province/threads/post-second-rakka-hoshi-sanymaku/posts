They control the vast majority of the western mountain range. These mountains are filled with forests, villages and cities, shrines, plains, valleys, rivers, ponds, farms, dojos, remains of lost or dead tribes, and Shiniga Ancestors only know what. \u00a0Samurai, Shiniga Ashagiru, and Shingami Priests can commonly be found due to Shiniga's devotion to these mountains, as if they were one with the universe and the mountains spoke through them.

I've brought some items for mental and physical fatigue plus a few potions, not to mention Shinigami Mist Scrolls to add some cover when we make our move. Mind you, we may have to kill a couple of Ronin while there if we come across them.

Ren seemed to be in deep contemplation of the mission set before him, mostly disinterested in his partner for now, who seemed to be going over the list of supplies he brought. In reality Ren preferred to work alone in missions, even when his partner was a hitokiri. They were great fighters, but Ren felt the Star Reapers were much better suited for missions that required stealth such as these. Even now all of the words he was saying, Ren already knew, he had already pinned down all these details long ago, did this man think he was too incompetent to know these things. Ren peered at him from behind his black mask for a moment as they moved along through the black rice fields, as if sizing him up. While the Hitokiri lept and sprinted through the fields deftly, the star reaper samurai seemed to float through them at a similar speed, hardly making a noise as he did so.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"Mmmmh...\" "}, "post-21169": {"user": null, "user_num": null, "timestamp": "1452803462000", "message": "The Empress' rider had been waved through the check point and through into the lands of the Shiniga.
