It is like unto a city in and of itself, separated from the rest of the capitol by water, it is only accessible via boat. Those who choose to come here must first pass through the Drunk Lover's Gate run by a sword-polisher named Nizume. Relinquishing one's weapons is not required, however those who carry weapons, even samurai, will find their service politely denied at the geisha houses and taverns of Sake Cup Island.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/l5r/images/4/4c/Teardrop_Island.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20141028164359"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/l5r/images/4/4c/Teardrop_Island.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20141028164359\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}}
