Everyday, he woke up early, and had a light breakfast before reporting to the dojo. Here Sora practiced the arts of the warrior, and sought to hone his skills to perfection. Most days he trained from sun rise to sun down, others longer. His training was his life, and he lived it everyday.He was now fourteen, already having trained for years, he was nearly ready to become a full-fledged Samurai. Sora knew this, but he did not let this effect his training, he would train as hard as he did his first days of training regardless, all the way to the end. Even then, training did not end for a samurai, he would be refining his skills for the rest of his life most likely. Presently, Sora meditated on the wooden deck that wrapped around the outside of the dojo, sitting cross-legged facing the rising sun. He inhaled and exhaled softly, taking in the warmth of the morning sun. He would remain like this until his master, the one who trained him, summoned him, just as he did every day.\u00a0Meditating was part of Sora's training as much as physical conditioning or archery practice was, except this training fortified his mind, and tempered it so it would remain strong in the face of battle. He was taught to focus just on his breathing, and nothing else.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "It was early dawn, the sun just now peeking over the horizon when Sora arrived at the Dojo, ready for another day of training.
