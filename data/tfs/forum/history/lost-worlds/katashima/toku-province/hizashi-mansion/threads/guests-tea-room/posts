Her whole time spent with him he never revealed why exactly they were running.\"As I told your sensei, Omura,\" he continued, \"I once served Kagen Uesung as a blacksmith and a samurai.  When I realized that what I was doing was wrong... I left.  In solitude I lived, even after Kagen was killed.  I was relieved to know evil had been vanquished from the land, but still I isolated myself and contemplated all the death and misery I had helped create.\"Aiko cleared her throat and interrupted.  \"Sorry, master, but what does this have to do with me?\"\"Quiet, young Aiko,\" he said calmly.  \"Not all the Uesung died that day.  It would seem that Kenjin Uesung, the seed of evil, was whisked away to the dreaded Isle of Bishonton.  There, I have no doubt he was raised to be more brutal, more harsh, and just as evil as his father, Kagen.  Now he has returned, and he seeks what is rightfully his.  He wants land, and people to work his fields; he seeks surpluses of food for which to feed his armies.  If he is allowed to succeed in this... he will bring about war and chaos to Katashima.\"The Swordmaster then closed his eyes and sighed sadly.  \"I cannot let him to corrupt his sister.\"Aiko looked down in deep curiosity and then turned her head to look at the Swordmaster.  \"What?\"  She began breathing hard and was afraid to hear what came next.The old man shook his head sadly.  \"I knew one of the Uesung children survived.  She was taken by one of the other samurai who participated in the Uesung's extermination.  Little did I know that Kenjin also survived.  I sat in isolation, but I would often check on the young Uesung... who was given the name...\" the Swordmaster looked at Aiko.  \"Aiko.  I had to make sure she was given a proper upbringing, to make sure she was not like her father.\"Aiko shook her head, not wanting to accept the truth.  Tears began to stream down her eyes.  Any and all restraint was gone.  \"What... I'm... that can't be!  I'm not a Uesung!  Kenjin is not my brother!\"The Swordmaster, still shaking his head, continued.  \"It is true, Aiko, I am sorry.  You are a Uesung, and Kenjin is your brother.  And you must stay away from him, lest he corrupt you like the warrior-monks of Bishonton corrupted him, and all of your ancestors.  That's why I must give you away to one of the Daimyo, so you can serve them faithfully, and not your brother.

Their dishonor is a stain on our own souls. Dishonor can only be cleansed with blood. So, you put me in a precarious position...\" He paused and took a deep, labored breath before he looked up to the Swordmaster, then Aiko. \"If you stay here, you must swear off any allegiance to this Uesung family.
