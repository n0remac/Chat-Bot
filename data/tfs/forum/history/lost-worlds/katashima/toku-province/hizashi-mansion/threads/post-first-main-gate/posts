The land itself was rich and bountiful, a splendid glimpse for the eyes of an Empress deprived of views beyond her castle walls.Isao accounted for the men who immediately stood behind the Empress. It was only appropriate a Lady of such esteemed station have a significant retinue of guardsmen to follow her person. He gave the six a cordial nod but otherwise focused his attention on Suzume. After all, it was only appropriate the highest ranking samurai in all the land was due the most attention.

She took a deep breath of the air here and released it, heedless of the interest of Isao beside her. It was not something she thought about; if a man found her attractive or not. Perhaps, at first, she had been flattered by the attention, but Suzume was sharp, and intelligent. She realized quickly that men did not stare at her because tehy were arrested by any sort of beauty; they stared at her like they would stare at a tiger, or some exotic beast on a circus display. A woman in a position of power was rare enough; a woman who took the seat where only men had ruled before?It was once thought impossible. And then, there was she, the Golden Empress, turning the impossible into reality. Then again, some said behind backs and palms that Suzume had gained her position with poison and betrayal, and that the Mandate of Heaven would never allow her to sit the throne for long. If this was true, it only made sense that it now seemed as if she was rushing to make her commands of the daimyo.\"Lord Ashikaga,\" she said, and turned her gaze off of the flowers to regard him as they walked over a small bridge. She came to pause upon it, the gently flowing water beneath them throwing her grand, golden reflection back up at them. \"I would like to know how Lord Genji stands with Daimyo Yanata. They are of like interests, so it is not a far-fetched guess to assume that they might be allies. Even friends.\"The Yanata Clan, of course, was the clan that the Empress had greatly dishonored when she had reneged on the contract that had been made between the Yanata Clan and the Moritomo. She had been a girl of eight when she had signed the scroll, promising to wed the Yanata heir when she came of age. That promise had never been fulfilled, and with the power as Empress, she had broken the contract. It was a slap in the face of tradition, and yet, perhaps it was even moreso appalling given she was a woman. No doubt, had her father been the one to change his mind, it would have been annoying and frustrating, but forgiven. Men, of course, were meant to rule. The Empress, however? They had never had to deal with one before, but if she were to follow tradition of royal women, she was meant to marry -- and quickly -- and bequeath all the power of her symbolism unto her husband; all her wealth, all her land, all of her power.The Empress, instead, had chosen to keep it.

The reason Suzume had never seen the young lord was because he had never been in attendance of the Imperial Court in Mitzushima. His father, the vassal lord Ashikaga Masaru, had generally represented his family or one of his dutiful retainers. Isao was far too young, far too entrenched in his youth training, to have been submerged into the affairs of court. So, while courtiers whispered silken promises and poisonous lies behind their fans, Isao was none the wiser to such inappropriate words. In the eyes of the young Ashikaga the Empress was just and it was the will of Heaven that she ruled in absence of a man.When she paused atop of the bridge the indigo clad samurai stood beside her. The late spring day was beautiful to behold as the wind whispered through the gardens. The sun stood high in the sky and pale blue skies stretched far across the heavens in inviting quality. The day was perfect and a painter\u2019s touch could not capture its beauty. As the natural yet artistically cultivated gardens sighed around them, with their scents enrapturing the senses, Isao felt disarmed. It was an odd sensation to be in the company of one of such importance and a small detachment of no doubt highly skilled warriors.With the question poised Isao turned his eyes fully upon the Empress. \u201cIf you might excuse me, my Empress, I cannot readily admit to whether my Lordship shares a love for the other great lords of the land,\u201d he politely intoned. \u201cHowever, he has parlayed with many great men, of low and high station, in the line of his duty as daimyo. You would be inclined to speak with my master personally on the matter. He is, above all, a sincere man and has little to hide from you if you so ask.\u201dHis own sincerity was evident with his words which flowed with careful precision yet a comfortable ease. Disarmed as he was, he spoke truthfully on the matter to the inquiring lady. Isao was only vaguely familiar with the matters regarding the Empress and the Yanata Clan. Such affairs were beyond him \u2013 the politics of the Imperial bureaucracy, the great clans of Katashima and other stately affairs were not of his realm. He could more readily speak of the martial arts, the gentle arts and of calligraphy if she was curious but he felt inept to provide deep discourse on external affairs. Lord Hizashi would provide a far keener insight.Isao would watch as a falling leaf met the course of the babbling stream beneath the bridge and was whisked away on the current. His dark eyes followed the leaf and in that moment he was struck with inspiration. For the first time since her arrival the young samurai shared a small, genuine smile. With a resolve to capture the moment, the young samurai constructed a poem. He spoke slowly in a poetic tempo as he offered it aloud to his divine companion.\u201cLeaf borne unto wind,Falls gracefully onto stream,Carried gently on.Spring season promises life,Turbulence stirs new questions.\u201dThe tanka poem he constructed perfectly captured the moment while at the same time had a deep, insightful and thought provoking quality. Within the beauty of the moment he explored the principles surrounding her arrival. In a moment as quickly as a falling leaf, Isao veiled that exposed smile. His face resumed a passive, stoic as stone appearance. His eyes flickered to her, curious about her appreciation of the arts. A cultured soul promised much and spoke volumes of character.

While beautiful and robust in its appearance, the Hizashi lands could be viewed rustic and far too rural for the tastes of a lady raised in the Imperial courts. Life here was far too different to be understood. Perhaps she had grown all too quickly bored of the gardens themselves? He had no idea how to cater to the selective tastes of an Imperial princess \u2013 no less the ruling Empress of Katashima. This reality stirred a desire to impress her in some manner. The poetry, if her words were sincere, had been a point in his favor. However, he wondered if her patience was being tested.Time was fickle when intimately pressed as it was. So, he resolved to keep her entertained less her time in the Toku province be considered anything but hospitable.
