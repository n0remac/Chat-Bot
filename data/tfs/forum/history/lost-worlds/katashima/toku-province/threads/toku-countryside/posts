His features were handsome though refined from four decades of experience. His eyes were sharp like an eagle and entirely scrutinizing in their gaze. His flared kataginu bore the crane heraldry of the Ashikaga family. If the Empress firmly recollected the sight of the man, she might recall his presence in the Imperial Court.\u201cAre you well, Suzume-heika? My men thought you dead when we rode out to the scene,\u201d Masaru spoke in a quiet tone. \u201cMy physicians tell me your health is\u2026 Miraculously well, if not without a few injuries you will survive.

When she returned she pressed the wooden ladle to the Empress\u2019 lips and urged to slowly drink as he helped her sit upright as not to choke. There was no doubt that on her parched tongue the water would be a gracious reprieve from the mild dehydration she suffered. When the Empress had drank enough the ladle was returned to the basin and the matron smiled before rising to step away.

She appeared as beautiful and golden as she always was, yet seated whenever she took an audience.Her men had been burried with honor, and she insisted that she be at the ceremony, attended by all noble households and villages who saw a pale Empress with a fierce set to her jaw and a refusal to sit, even with a broken leg, during the funeral ritual. It had taxed her greatly, but the effect had caused a flux of whispers in favor of the Empress through the people.Some argued, however, that that had been her intention. She had used the funeral of her men to further her political savvy and report with her people. If so, it was well done.She had become even more distant and untouchable than when she had arrived, perhaps out of pride and embarrassment of her perceived weakness. She had continued her correspondence with Miyuri, Sano, and her new Captain of the Glorious Hundred while she had been laid out, and was now eager and restless to visit the other provinces and lands of Katashima.Some argued that she should return to the Sacred City, where she would be safe, but that was not an option for Suzume. Her medics told her that putting strain on her wounded leg with travel would give her a permanent limp; she replied that she would finish her journey, whether limping or crawling.
