Again, Madame Naoki speaks telepathically to Lieutenant Finch.\u00a0\u201cHmm. I see. Literally so. You would seem to have stumbled across a people whom Isra hasn\u2019t yet made acquaintance of. The waters you\u2019re in- they\u2019re far too dangerous for our ships to venture into, and the woods on the shore are equally hazardous to explorers. The whole area was written off as a dangerous wilderness, and I suppose no one had the presence of mind to scout it from the air. Not before you, I suppose. Hmm.\u201d\u201cWell, I suppose there\u2019s not really too many options available to you in this situation. I would suggest playing the situation by ear, and doing your best to give a positive impression while simultaneously assessing the people. You may tell them of Isra if they ask, and state our foreign policy of only seeking to establish positive relationships and trade partners. I\u2019ll continue to watch over your metaphorical shoulder, and prepare reinforcements and an embassy.\u201d\u201cIf, at any point, you or your squad are under threat, you should attempt to escape. While it would be pleasant to make friends out of these dwarves, if they would unjustly punish or imprison you, I don\u2019t think we would want much to do with them. Be appropriately cautious. I\u2019ll be right here if you\u2019d like to consult me for advice, but do your best- I know you always do.\u201d", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Silently, the purple gemstone on her necklace begins to glimmer and shine.
