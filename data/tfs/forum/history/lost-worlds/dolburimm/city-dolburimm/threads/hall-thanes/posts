Shards of Axes used by my ancestors, pieces of fabric from the sails of our most famous ships, trophies from our most costly victories. It is these things which define my people and I. The deeds of the past are to be learnt from. Each a tale. Each a lesson. Each to be frozen in these halls for all Thanes, present and future, to look over and consult with those who have given their last breath to enter the eternal slumber. In this sense we never truly leave this world. We live on forever in our actions and the memories of others.\" Thelnir was old, even by dwarven standards, having lived for over 300 years. This had given him plenty of time, especially in his latter years, to contemplate what it means to be alive. He was by all accounts as wise as he was old. \u00a0\"So Lieutenant, what can you tell me of your lands?\" He came to a stop as he entered another hall, gesturing to Liz to enter.
