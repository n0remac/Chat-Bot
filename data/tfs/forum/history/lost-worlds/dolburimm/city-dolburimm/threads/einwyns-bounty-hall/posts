A feast is a glorious occasion to celebrate both an event that has passed or is to come and to give thanks to Einwyn for filling the seas and providing bounty enough for the Dolburese to thrive.Thelnir let out a hearty chuckle as his arms spread forth to gesture at the sight in front of him. \"Come Cousin, let us feast together and celebrate your departure in the morrow.\" He playfully patted Nalric on the back, perhaps a little too hard as was his way before turning to his guest. \"I hope you like fish Izumi. I have people to go and talk to but for now, why don't you stay with Nalric. I'm sure he'll show you to all of our greatest dishes\" Without even waiting for a reply, and with his head trailing off to one side before he had even finished his sentence to his quest, he strode off and into the arms of another rugged looking dwarf. Their conversation was too far away to really hear much of it apart from Thelnir great his friend. \"Gurnum it is good that you are still alive!

Please take me on my word when I say that you are free here to do as you please. This hall for the feast is meant to celebrate, praise and prepare. Tomorrow, we embark into the embrace of Einwyn and there we may stay, or we may yet return with more good for our people.\" Nalric reached over to a large metal tankard, took a deep draw from the full glass.

The last sentence she had heard clear, but even now she hesitated to answer. She was unfamiliar with their drinks and was almost sure they would not be able to serve her Sake. She looked around her seeing if she would spot a familiar drink among the croud, but they were in big wooden jugs and it was almost impossible to see what was inside them. \"Do you serve wine Nalric-san?\" ", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "She would follow Nalric around and tried to not be distracted by everything that was happening around her.
