From the colossal statures which flank either side of the port entrance to the multiple tiers of stone buildings which make up the majority of the city. However the most intriguing part of the entire city is what visitors are first greeted with; The docks. This waterfront area is teeming with activity with ships constantly coming and going, be it to fish, to hunt or even to forage, the docks are the heart of the city.Once past\u00a0Bunrigg and Malnir, Elizabeth and her men were met with this bustling site with many ships leaving in the opposite direction, each one filled with dwarfs both male and female. The Griffins would have to be careful as they towed the battered ship towards the dry docks, taking extra care to make sure they didn't collide with any of the countless other vessels. Many of the onlooking dwarfs watched in a confused wonder at the situation; A vessel of their own making being pulled into port by essentially a group of winged monsters and their strange humanoid handlers.\u00a0The City itself, while very busy, was a visage of dullness, almost grim in nature. The drab grey stone that many of the buildings had been hewn from, coupled with the constant rain and grey skies, made for a less then appealing atheistic look. Thankfully though the locals more then made up for it, with their hearty resilience and enthusiastic love of the sea.\u00a0\"Over there, In one of the bays. Just a little further\" Dalden said pointing towards an empty bay in the dry dock. He tried his best to lower his tone as not to sound too commanding and offend the strangers however it was against his very nature and more then likely was not too convincing. He sighed deeply in relief as the ship grinded to a halt against the roughly carved stone wall of the basin they had aimed for. \"Well Welcome to Dolburimm\u00a0Lieutenant Elizabeth Finch.\" He raised his arms as if to gesture to the city around him proudly. \"Now, I haven't spoke to any of the Thanes yet clearly, but I think they'd rather you leave the beasts at dry docks. It's just many of our folk aren't too used to them yet\" Looking around would indeed strengthening this point as many of the dry dock workers had even taken cover, ran away or were looking on in amazement at the handful of strange flying beasts which now occupied the immediate area.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<Captain Dalden and Lieutenant Elizabeth Finch enter from Open Seas Border Thread>"}, "post-35891": {"user": "Elizabeth Finch", "user_num": 1337, "timestamp": "1462206884000", "message": "She and her men looked about them at the strange new city, but even here there was beauty to be found.

Liz gave a reassuring pet to St. George, whispered something in his ear, and he went to go stand with the rest of the griffins.
