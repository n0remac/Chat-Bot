At the very centre one can find all the activity. Here you can smell beer being made for those on land, and rum for the hardy sailors. Of course one can also hear the occasional bottle smashed for use as a weapon, or even feel the explosion from a brewery. This is not rare in the distillery district, for without much metal it is difficult to brew without a few \"accidents.\" Throughout the whole place one can see wondrous things. Small mechanical things ambling about, lamps based on alcohols, kitchens always burning. Of course the unreliable and often dangerous nature of these (usually) prototypes makes them only last about a day before being scrapped. Outside of the Brewer's realm is the Alchemical Circle. Here the Dwarfs use various chemicals often with the aid of aforementioned alcohol for various purposes. Matches, candles, even the Flame of Dolburrim, an ingenious sprayer of burning ethanol to easily deal with enemies the stunties face. Finally, there is a small amount of engineers and craftsmen outside of the Alchemical Circle, merely there to leech away at the creativity and ingenuity of those in the centre of the district. They rarely make anything new short of improving the already master-craft Crossbows and Ballistae Dolburrim has to offer.   Brewers and Brawlers:The Dwarves in the Brewery District always wear enough layers of leather and hide protection to make themselves nearly spherical in shape. This is of course for fear of the many flames and explosions always happening. Those with armed roles will have various bone plates and skull-helmets to stop even more harm. They will usually sport masks and goggles to keep away the sometimes asphyxiating smells and gasses throughout, sticking charcoal within them in extreme cases. The Dwarfs here have a tendency to fight. Rivalries over who makes better beverages occur daily, giving the locals many petty feuds and the punch of a hammer. In serious cases they will resort to stabbing each other with smashed glass bottles, or even trying to burn each other with Flames of Dolburrim. Of course the hardiness of the locals as well as inner sense of honour stops fatalities from occurring often, but one must watch out.The Brewers themselves have several vessels of their own to look for kelp, seaweed and meats to ferment. Their ships are usually slow hulking things made to hold cargo and weather anything the sea can throw at them, not speed. However, they are only slow compared to the other ships of Dolburrim. They still glide faster across the water than many foreigners can hope to on similar classes of ships. The fighters usually use the standard crossbows of Dolburrim but will also use their abundant alcohol for flames of Dolburrim and their skills in brawling to give pirates a very nasty surprise. When boarded or boarding, they make use mauls and blades made of bone of the creatures of the deep, harder than most metals and often having little-understood and strange effects upon victims. They usually wear their leather in conjunction with various shells on their body, and skulls in their heads. They also make extensive use of pistol crossbows, often study enough to be used as an club when reloading is not possible. The current Head of Beverages:Until quite recently, the Head of Beverages was a spot taken not only by waiting for the current one to be deceased (as it is now) but to also speed up their process of becoming deceased. However, the current Head of Beverages has outlawed this after a combination of his rather hilarious luck and his extensive traps killed many of his former colleagues. Hans \"Rigger\" Vodic while quite modern compared to the other residents of the Brewing district, is still quite xenophobic and set in his ways. Still, he is a cheery fellow, and has a small group of his most trusted advisors with him nearly always. His main job is to settle disputes, and to be the head researchers of the place, carrying the most advanced equipment and recipes with him. While the Thanes hold much more power and are higher in the hierarchy, the fact that there are three of them gives them great autonomy.OOC: This is the place for arpee of the Brewing District and their small private force/fleet as well as internal politics.
