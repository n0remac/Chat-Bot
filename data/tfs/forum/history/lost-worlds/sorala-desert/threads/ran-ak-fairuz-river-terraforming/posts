Then, they began to extend that lake into the Sorala Desert, moving sand by the thousands of pounds, forming river beds.They were terraforming, creating a river and surrounding green areas with palms and shrubbery, that would wind into the heart of the Sorala from the mystical city of Sakand itself...and possibly into the Tribelands where the Bedouins made their haven.The camp is full of guards, workers, majes, and others to help with the terraforming efforts.\u00a0 \u00a0 ", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1274/open-desert", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/2550/shahran-tribelands"], "image_list": ["https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/c5/85/37/c58537a83b4b63a6e91b75a17b9693c1.jpg", "https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/65/99/f6/6599f6dca6704d69df882f3f005eb047.jpg", "https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/80/cf/c2/80cfc2bbb67bb5947e985d940d09a353.jpg", "https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/b1/fe/57/b1fe575ecc4d212af544963ecce5b5a7.jpg"], "html": "On the western side of the City of Sakand, some miles away but within distance of the high walls and glowing lights of the mystical city is a camp of hundreds of workers -- most of those "}, "post-66192": {"user": null, "user_num": null, "timestamp": "1494478656000", "message": "Servants collected Sir Cairex Forgepyre and @safiya in the morning, and after they were given a hearty breakfast and Safiya was taken to the armory to choose their weapons, they were deposited by flying carpet to this camp within clear sight of the Sakandi walls.

Myths and legends state that the river was big enough for naval fleets to have battles, and Fairuz expected nothing less.There were scouts guarding, with their eyes peeled for the dunes around them. The Sakandi people were not idiots -- they knew well the stories of the bandits and bedouin tribes and monsters that lurked in the Sorala. They were not elite warriors, however. Although prepared and trained, one couldn't put them in the status that paid mercenaries could attend. The Hummingbird Guard of the city of Sakand were such warriors, of course, but their numbers could not be too populous along the camps on both sides of the river, given they were still greatly needed to protect the city itself. Sakand was not too far from the camp -- about three miles out by now.Hatim was spotted. How could he not?
