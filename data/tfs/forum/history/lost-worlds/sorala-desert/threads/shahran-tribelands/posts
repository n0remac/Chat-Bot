It is hard to tell what the most dangerous thing about these lands is.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A good argument can be made that it is the shifting sands and lack of water that make these lands dangerous. Unprepared travelers often die of thirst or heat stroke while traveling across them. Flora and fauna of this land are just as dangerous, monstrous insects preying on the unwary, small snakes striking at those who misstep and inflicting them with deadly toxins that will kill a man in a matter of days if they do not find the home of the Shahran Tribe, wherein the antidotes are located.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps the ruins that dot the landscape are the more perilous, for ancient, undisturbed secrets are often protected by the foulest and most monstrous of things, warped and twisted by centuries of isolation. Rarely do treasure seekers return from such expeditions alive, and those that do are almost always apprehended by the Tribe, who guard such ruins with zeal. But, those who brave such perils can find themselves at the semi-permanent home of the Shahranian people, a modern village constructed atop the ruins of a long-dead city, the people here are wary of foreigners, fearing them to be Sakandi spies. Those that have earned the trust of the Shahranians find themselves to be loyal and useful allies, allowing such people to properly journey into the ruins with the aid of the Tribespeople. The ever-shifting nature of the desert, however, means that new ruins are always appearing and disappearing; even the natives have trouble keeping track of their locations.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://imgur.com/NNa1n5W.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://imgur.com/NNa1n5W.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/></div>"}, "post-64639": {"user": "Sheikh Rashid Al-Shahran", "user_num": 2224, "timestamp": "1493571045000", "message": "The Sheikh of Shahran watched from the top of his tower as the Shamans performed the rituals that signified the end of the working day for the tribespeople, an event that coincided with the rising of the sun.
