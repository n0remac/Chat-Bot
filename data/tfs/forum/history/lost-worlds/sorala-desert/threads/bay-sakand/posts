But that's not how Fairuz appeared, other than a flare of her eyes. She remained calm. A temper only granted short-term gain. The woman knew better. The woman believe in appearances. Appearances could be great armor, as well as a great weapon.So, instead, she took a breath, and made sure that her shoulders remained poised where they wanted to stiffen, made sure that her hands, folded in front of her, remained relaxed when they wanted to fist. She was collected. She was the Lady of Sakand.In truth, Fairuz knew that her request would be denied, but if nothing was ventured, nothing was gained. She wasn't entirely appreciative of being told that her request was made due to pride as a leader, rather than pride as being Sakandi, but that was a slight that only Fairuz would ever know, that only Fairuz would ever remember.Sakand was weak. Fairuz had been smart enough to realize that Goraia could be a tool to gain strength in the city -- after all, it had been so easily crippled when the orb had been taken from the tower. Clearly, there was a huge and gaping flaw in that lay of the city and its surrounding lands that needed to be accounted for. She had been hoping that given her previous relationship with Isra's Chancellor that Isra might grant Sakand more, but Fairuz was realistic. This wasn't Ryden she was talking to (although even Ryden was not a man to simply roll over, as Fairuz had discovered), but another beast. Fairuz could use Isra as she had used Goraia. They could revisit Sakand's sovereignty at a later date.Yet, the pill was hard to swallow.\"I will sign the document, but I will not do it here. I invite you into Sakand, to take refreshment, as well as to discuss with me the changes I should expect,\" Fairuz said to Grandma, gesturing to the gates behind her.
