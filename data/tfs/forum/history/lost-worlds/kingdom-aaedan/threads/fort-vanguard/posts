In that time the fort's contruction was finished. Made not from the white stone Aaedan is so known for but whatever resources were near. the Fort's contruction was a five sided walled courtyard with a keep stationed on a small pleatues over looking Aaedan's northern forests and borders. From here the fort could supply troops to the northern and eastern borders. With the shaky alliance of the Lion and the Phoenix, both Aaedanian and Phoenix soldiers are stationed within the fort. Should hostilities once again take place between the nations a fight for the keep would surely ensue and the winner would hold an important strategic position.
