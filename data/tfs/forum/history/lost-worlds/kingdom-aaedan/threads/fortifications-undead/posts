It was an ironic twist of fate that the Land-Tiller's State had formed an alliance with these benevolent undead. The Land-Tillers would provide a distraction while the massive mechanical worm did its job.The first to respond to the undead troop movements would be the wyvern corps. With their aerial view, they could see the undead beginning to march while also starting to position undead archers along the walls.The initial volley might take out a few soldiers, but with the help of half the psionic corps, the wyvern corps' intelligence would be transmitted to the rest of the Land-Tillers, causing them to make a temporary retreat just to stay out of range of their shots, before pulling out their long bows and returning fire. Most of the mounted archer corps could wield longbows with draw weights in excess of a hundred pounds, some even going as high as 150 pounds. Their accurate range was anywhere from 300 to 400 meters.The wyvern corps themselves also had vastly superior reach due to their altitude and would help snipe the archers from above.The other half of the psionic corps dedicated themselves to defensive spells to help sway the archer vs archer battle more to their side.\u00a0Raynor himself would begin channeling healing and defensive spells to prevent loss of life this early in the battle.The objective wasn't necessarily to kill the undead. Thanks to Ralakor's training and their own past experiences, the Land-Tillers knew that arrows wouldn't be able to kill the undead, but they could at least temporarily cripple them. Shots from 100 lb draw weight bows could penetrate steel armor if necessary, and could send a being made of nothing but bones flying back several meters, causing them to land right on their bare spines, should they connect. Strikes to the limbs could blow the limbs clean off. A good sternum or spine strike could cut an undead in half.Meanwhile, the falcon corps were done charging their mana and were having their falcons place a large number of magical runes on the ground \u00a0and in the air\u00a0behind their own forces as part of their fail safe strategy. The mounted mages and wyvern mages continued to gather power for the Land-Tiller's primary offensive while letting the archers, psionic corps, and Raynor do their work.

It tried to put his mind to sleep, to let it wander. It was trying to gain control. Ralakor crushed that feeling with his powers. His people will not fall under the sway of another. Not again.

She seemed so delicate, like a tiny blossom with the softest petals as it yearned to grow.<br><br/>But she was not so youthful - that much was apparent to him. Not from a physical aspect, but by the size and shape of her dragon form. It spoke the words to tell him she was not a new guardian. Crystal clear eyes met the golden sunrise orbs set in her face, and they softened almost painfully. She reminded him of a time before he went to lay to rest at the request of the very earth. Of a mate he took, and surrendered.<br/><br/>He inhaled deep and let it out slowly, before making his way in very heavy, thudding steps towards her. When he came to stand mere feet away from her, he would stop and watch her from above - his hulking figure seeming to dwarf her own in a number of ways.<br/><br/>His voice comes out in that booming baritone, but at the same time a purr that renders him not so frightening. \"You... are Earthwarden. It is my honor to meet the chosen one,\" he greets, feeling a bit awkward in his words.
