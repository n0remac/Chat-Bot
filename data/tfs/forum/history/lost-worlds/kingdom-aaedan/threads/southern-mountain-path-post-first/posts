The sky, unharmed by any Light Pollution, was very colorful despite the darkness it cast upon the world. There were purples, reds, blues, and green spots in the sky. These spots of light that looked like small nets connecting small amounts of stars. It was as if there was no sky, only space. The moon itself was yet another phenomenon, carrying a blueish silver look to it. The moon was very young, maybe 112,000 years of age. It's light was a transparent blue or white, depending on one's location. The clouds that passed before the moon was a transparent smokey grey in color. As the moons light would pass through the clouds, some would be reflected casting a metallic look to the clouds. The clouds were not rain clouds, they just lacked the refraction to create their natural glossy white color.The temperature below was perfect. A soft breeze came in from the south east, causing a subtle warmth upon contact. The temperature itself was low, standing around seventy one degrees. Fall was setting in on the lands, putting the world in a tranquil weather pattern.Despite the world suffering what is becoming of it from it's creation, it still went on. Fall, like Spring, was an offering from the the spirit Mother Gaia to warn the people of hard weather, harvest their final crops or prepare to plant, and whatever else came with Summer and Winter. Fall and Spring were there to calm the world, forcing nations to stop wars to worry about their own. This very weather on this night was an offering of peace from Mother Gaia to Gravlor. She knew what was going to happen. If she could not please the Ka of Love, Gravlor, then she would use it to please the people of the lands. This weather was here to make the two entities feel safe hoping she could make Gravlor turn from this land. Sadly, Gravlor's decision was instantaneous. When he started to see the energies of Love in space with it's colors and light, when he seen the energies in the lands and air, it all sickened him. He loved it all, which caused his sadness. He had to destroy it to get his revenge on Mother Gaia; he would make her suffer.  Gravlor would decide it was time to find a safe place to sleep for the night. He had used a lot of energy in his first day awake. He needed to eat something and rest for a little while. He hoped that by leaving the others in the far west, he could find a sanctuary in the east. If he could find the right location, he would use the land here for his new den until he returned to the frozen lands he called home.Maybe the world would be safe for the night...

He had dropped down one or twice to grab a bear or something to eat. He returned to the skies as quick as he fell. Despite not fully sleeping, he wasn't expending energy, which allowed his body to restore it's energy. And then a thought hit him, triggering Trodgor's Anger. He would spot a small watchtower and Garrison, nothing that he couldn't handle. The stop here would be quick and easy one. Gravlor would fold in his wings and form into a dragon torpedo. Here he felt like expanding on his High Gravity capabilities. As he reached a cloud, he would focus his energy into his body. The blue lines and stones would begin to pulse. After a second of light, a sonic boom like sound filled the land. It sounded as if a mountain had split. A small, blue and white ring formed in the air where Gravlor activated his High Gravity core power.In less than a second a boom that matched the first one erupted. The dirt would fly high into the air, nearly two hundred yards. Whatever had happened was definitely destructive and a surprise to everyone since he didn't approach it as he normally had.The ground had cratered, forming a football sized ring around Gravlor. He had directed himself to hit on the Garrison, taking out it's most formidable foe in this round. Around Gravlor the debris still cluttered the air, only offering a blueish white energy that was his next strike.As the debris fell, Gravlor looked for the outpost. He immediately seen the watchtower and released his blast over the lands. Even if he missed and got close, he could crumble it. Whatever remained of the garrison, if anything, would see their deaths shortly.Gravlor stood on all four, smashing the ground in a fan like movement with his mighty tail.

Those that neared him would hit the ground before they could reach him due to the High Gravity Field around him. Despite slow retreat, he still was in his High Gravity Mode, making his body a hard thing to penetrate. Gravlor began to lower his body, as if preparing to spring upwards. His muscles would tense as he sunk all his weight towards the ground and pulled his wings in as tight as he could around him. He knew he couldn't release a blast in time to stop it and there was something leaping his way. The High Gravity would slightly intensify on Gravlor's body. This would slow him down a bit more, but add a little more strength to his body for what was about to come. Then it happened, the attack was released from Ashley.With Gravlor's body fully tensed and prepared, he kept the strongest park of his head toward her. This piece protected much of his neck in it's restricted form. It also allowed Gravlor to keep his face towards the inside of his body. This is what would take the hit from Ashley.A black smoke like essence would roll from the nostrils and mouth of Gravlor. His eyes would flicker to a ruby color, as well as the neon blue markings on his body. The markings and eyes returned to blue, and the smoke essence rolled no more. What remained of the essence would move through the air towards Raena Fletcher, who appeared and was weakened from their magics they used. Even if Gravlor was ever defeated, it could reawaken in her. If Trogdor's Anger entered her form, it would do nothing at all for the time being. A quick smoke would layer their eyes, but as stated, it would do absolutely nothing to change their status. (It is up to you whether it does or not, I just figured i'd state what it would do either way.)As the blast hit Gravlor this spot, a wave of silence would sweep across the area. A wave of energy would be released following this wave of silence. Then there was the room that sent a quake across the area, rupturing the ground in a wave like motion, leaving a small area of dirt and rock waves. The explosion of energy from the High Gravity Field that was trying to suppress everything around Gravlor and the explosion of Kinetic Energy from the bolt would not mix well. An explosion of light would follow the main explosion point, capable of temporarily blinding them if they looked right at it. This same explosion of energy would prevent Jorech from reaching his destination. The pure force in the explosion from the two opposite energy collided. It wouldn't cause anything vital, but Jorech, no matter how strong, would find a wall from the energy that would send him flying backwards across the ground if he tried to add his force into it when there was basically a miniature super nova occurring.The air around Gravlor was filled with dirt and dust. It was definitely impossible to see him for this short bit, as it was impossible for him to see the others. It would cause a moment of peace to the area, a suspenseful peace.Gravlor would suffer more damage than any of them. His ears were left ringing, being that his ears could pick up the high pitch that the others didn't in the silence. A fracture in his scaling on his head where the blast hit and drawing a bit of silver blood.This might be his only opportunity to escape and he needed to seize it. He was in the worst moment of pain, but he had planned for this moment the entire time since he realized that Ashley was going to hit him with a mass of fire originally. He didn't expect what happened, but he knew something like it would happen.When the energy settled and the debris was high in the air, Gravlor would push upwards and begin to spread his wings. He used his entire might to fight the High Gravity in the first seconds of his upward spring. There was a lot of power in this motion despite it being slow.Then Gravlor would release his High Grav Field. With power he had built up to fight against the High Grav Field, he would rocket into the air. His first flap would clear the mass of the debris to see him return to the point in the sky where shot down from. A lot of the speed was due to the High Grav Field being eliminated and nature having to fill that point.A loud noise that sounded almost pressurized erupted as Gravlor took upwards. How fast nature worked to fill the gravitational void that once was Gravlor's void. Maybe the others still stood after this release of energy, or maybe they fell on their butts and watched him; nothing serious would happen, but if close enough, they would be knocked over if not in a barrier. Jorech could try and jump after him, but even Jorech could only leap so high and Gravlor was moving extremely fast due to using the gravity and muscles to jump before flapping. With his head stretched out, as if he was arrow shot straight into the sky, he would cut through the sky even after he cleared his original drop point. He would fly much higher, so if he fell to due to his head wound, he could at least try to direct himself towards  the deserts to the North. He would move over the lands of The Free City and decide where to go next. He was definitely contemplating going to his den till he healed.Back on the ground, blue birds would flock the area. They would begin pecking and scratching the ground and eating anything they could that was dead. They would occasionally peck at the survivors, but more than likely not. Until Trogdor's Anger was released completely from Gravlor, these birds could continuously arrive at every battle at some point. \"That mage... she is calming... but she is not one of my Loves. She will pay for her trickery. The other child of Mother Gaia, she is also unique and of a strong heart...\" Gravlor began to think to himself, calming himself and his normal mind trying to come back. The damage from the blast had shook Gravlor enough to partially open his mind. He questioned himself, unaware of the curse that was controlling him. He was aware of everything that had happened, but the curse had him convinced it was Gravlor doing it and nothing was controlling him. It wouldn't be long before the anger came out, somehow twisting Gravlor's mind to get mad at them for being nice and defending themselves from the monster he was becoming.\"Mother Gaia, your children are not mine. You cannot bribe me, Liar. I will wreck you lands until my children return!\" Gravlor roared out loud, unable to be heard by anyone but himself.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "And yet the ballista rounds would fall around his form.

Trogdor's Anger had submitted to the Void as he went in, embracing it's power at whatever the cost. In the curse's mind, the Void was a vast land to grow in. Just as Anger was a Void in the mind, one that makes us feel terrible, wanting us to destroy what we cannot control. The Void, the one place even god's tend not to visit. Then Gravlor reappeared in the mortal realm with a dome around him. This dome, despite being part of what it was, would protect Gavlor from the outside warriors and protect the others from the battle that would soon ensure in this Void...Gravlor began to go berserk, slamming his head into the ground and bashing the sides of the dome. What many would think of as trying to escape, Gravlor was trying to get something out of his head. The black scale began to flake off, turning into a smokey black cloud. As he began to slow down and give in, he heard Andraste's words.In that moment, when he fully compensated what was going on, he let out an explosive roar that would reach through the dome. Black smoke began to pour out of his eyes, ears, nostrils, and mouth. What looked like smoke began to take a form... a form that was twice that of Gravlor's.Once the smoke stopped and Gravlor's scale was to it's normal color, Gravlor would begin to erupt in a blue and white light. Even the Void would feel the light that erupted from Gravlor's energy in this. In this void, will no ties to the mortal realm and their rules, would unleash the full potential of Gravlor.Gravlor would revert to his ancient form, when gods walked the Overworld. It much resembled the original form of Gravlor, but much more massive. He had double his size, and had three heads. On each head there was the marking of Gaia and Love. It was who he served, who he Loved, and what had brought him to life to witness the joy of living. Even though his form was intimidating, he acted as a mother for people, loving them through their shortfalls and protecting them from evils. Gravlor Final Form - Ka Power UnleashedDespite Gravlor turning into a magnificent beast of legend that only those who were here this day to witness, a monstrosity was forming from the smoke. It's body was a metallic black and grey with voids for eye sockets. It's body build more like a humanoids than a dragon, but none the less, it was a dragon. A terror that could not escape this void or destruction would fall upon the Overworld. This dragon was what the Overworld knows as the Curse of Trogdor's Anger. It was fitting that the dragon stood on it's hind legs preferably, suffering a human like quality from Trogdor's history.Trogdor's Anger - Bahaelemut, Ka of WrathWhat now was visible in the dome was two dragons; two dragons that man dared not to combat. Gravlor's fate was at hand, and the Ka of Love had found his host most fitting for the rules set by the gods in the mortal realm of the Overworld. Black, red, blue, and silver, bolts of lightning crashed around the outside of the dome. It would sustain the dome, as if locking it in place. Raena would probably find her Void less taxing on her body as these bolts worked their magic. A phenomena was at hand, one that could shake the foundation of the Overworld, and Gravlor needed Raena to hold herself together and keep her Void going. He would attempt to cast a healing energy upon her if he could connect with her somehow through the Void so she could. Even if he lost, she needed to be able to seal Bahaelemut, the Ka of Wrath, in the Void. At this point, that was all that mattered.A loud, deep, rumble would fill the mind of Gravlor, telepathically communicating with Gravlor, \"HA!HA!HA! You have released me! Between you and Trogdor, I got the power I needed. I could have went longer, but this Void... It was a good breeding ground for me.\"Gravlor would speak in a firm tone, \"You were beat by a child... One less than a millenia old... And you call yourself powerful? You are a coward... You ruined the lives of two mighty dragons of Mother Gaia... You've attacked defenseless people instead of taking on those your size... Your reign stops now. You will remain here, with me, in this Void.\u00a0In my last moments, they speak to me and ask me to change... to spare me. In these last moments, I will do what I must to make sure you die. Wrathful or not, Mother Gaia has changed, but for the better. My loves are here, but much further in life than I remember... Mother Gaia, forgive me.\"With that, the two dragons stretched their wings out fully, expanding their whole body and roared at each other. Bahaelemut's roared was hot, live lave. Gravlor's breathe was cold and pure, lacking darkness. The two dragons would begin to gather energy in the mouths; Gravlor's was white and Bahaelemut's was a crimson red.\u00a0The two dragon's released theirs blast. All three of Gravlor's heads would blast at the same spot, meeting the blast of dark energy that seemed so cozy in the black abyss of Raena's Void. This blast would last for a few seconds before they released the mass of energy to create a large orb of red and white light exploded.\u00a0As their blasts finished and the orb exploded, the two shot in at each other. They would rip, tear, chomp, scratch, headbutt, tailwhip... everything a dragon would do. Every time the two would come into range of each other, smaller blimps of light appeared. Roars and screams of pain could be heard from the two... if only voices could be heard.When the close range clashes ended and the two settled down again, bother were missing large chunks of flesh. Gravlor was missing one head. The two had really drew a lot of blood, and yet both stood as if they hadn't been hurt. Both were driven by ideals that gave them the power they needed to press on.\"Gravlor... Give in.. together we can rule this world and forge life how we want it...\", Bahaelemut spoke to Gravlor, still holding one of Gravlor's heads in his left hand.\u00a0\"I don't think so. That is not the destiny of these creatures... they can do things in this world that we never did. They are free... while we serve gods.\" Gravlor responded instantly.Bahaelemut chuckled a bit before he took a fast leap at Gravlor. He had got ahead of himself, his Anger blinding him. Bahaelemut suffered from his own curse. Even in all his power, he would fall.Gravlor would sink every bit of power he had remaining into one last blast. A massive ball of white lightning like energy formed, ten time the size of the beasts heads. Gathering so much power in such a short time was very taxing on Gravlor, possibly pushing death in his condition. It was all he had or he would fall to Bahaelemut with no real defense to a surprise rush.The blast would release. Unlike his normal blasts, instead of being a beam like blast, it would grow and blast like a white fire and lightning. He offered Bahaelemut no chance to escape, bring such a massive attack out in his rush.\"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!\", Bahaelemut roared as the blast began to hit him.The blast would engulf Bahaelemut, concealing his form within it's walls. The black form within would roar as pieces of him could be seen breaking off behind him, disintegrating quickly. It was quick \u00a0for Gravlor, but slow and painful for Bahaelemut. The energy of light attacked him down to his atoms that structure his draconic capabilities. There was nothing, not an atom, that remained of Bahaelemut, Ka of Wrath, a.k.a. Curse of Trogdor's Anger.But all was not glorious. Gravlor would fall forward, his energy completely drained. His body leaked blood into the Void, vanishing as quick as it fell. His chunks of scale were gone, possibly with the belly of Bahaelemut. In the moments before Gravlor passed out, he would smile, something he had not done in a long while. Death was upon him, but he hoped it was enough to show the people he was a good being.The lightning like energy surrounding the dome would vanish and surrender all the weight of the Void back to Raena. Inside the dome, Gravlor would lie on the ground in his mortal realm form. He had chunks of flesh missing all over his body. Deep wounds covered what was missing. What the warriors missed inside the Void in the last minutes left Gravlor in this shape.\u00a0 Alas, he was at the hands of the warriors who sought to kill him, one of these already making a hopeful, but failing attempt at striking Gravlor through the Void. The Void between the two locations could be a universe apart and still allow them to see each other, but neither could strike each other when the Void Dome was up. A powerful feature, the glitch of Life.Even if the Void let go Gravlor for some reason, there was a slim chance he would survive. If he did, it was by a miracle. His breathing was soft and slow.

He picked up his axes. \"I am not wanting to fight you, something in me really wants to, but I do not. I have seen what my daughter meant by the Phoenix People are a threat. You see the world as yours. Other kingdoms and nations as stepping stones, the great desert of yours as the ultimate deterrer against invaders. But no more. The Lion will not bow to the Phoenix! GET THE HELL OUT OF MY LANDS!\" Again the anger had built up as he spoke. One moment the king would be trying to get a peaceful resolution the next he would be antagonizing.WAR!!! Go to war! YOU CAN WIN! The voice in Jorechs head was growing stronger. The king was a happy good king. He wanted to expose Aaedan to the world, not for glory or conquest but find allies and friends. To get help in colonizing the East that had waged war against Aaedan since its inception. But through this war Aaedan had forged a powerful identity. Through magic hidden and ancient in the White City the humans of Aaedan had become something more. A race of shining eyes and strong bodies. These men and woman would follow the king to battle no matter where. A force of powerful warriors and magi, skilled archers and thundering cavalry. Men preaching on honor in their lives but offered none for their enemies. Lines of Aaedanians marching across the desert, the plains, the forest, cities he had never seen before falling before Aaedanian might. All these imaged flashed through Jorech's head. It was at this point however that Jorech truly realized something was wrong.He released his axes, they sunk deep into the ground from the small fall. \"I apologize.\" He looked up to Gravlor, \"I must seek your wisdom dragon, the beast you fought earlier, could it have lived? Could some small portion of it escaped you and entered someone, growing strong on rage until it could resurface once more? Is it possible?\" The king had a look of confused horror on his face.

I'll go when i'm ready.\" Zaltos spoke with a sarcastic tone, trying to push the man. Zaltos was well aware of his surroundings, and with a hot enough fire, he could burn it down for miles with a wildfire. Even if Jorech's strength was as great as it seemed to be with what he done in the battle, Zaltos worried none about it. He'd push the man, as if he wanted him to leap. He knew how to break Trogdor's Anger from the mind, but under recent TPS studies, they found it to be a disease.When Jorech finished talking to Gravlor, Zaltos cut in, \"I am the one who originally defeated this curse. Gravlor has only suffered as it's vessel. In the mind of the vessel, even after expulsion of the curse, the only thing they know is that there was something else within them that was a second life and it made them angry. A third conscious would be the best description.After studies done on this curse it is not only a magical curse, but a disease. Something about it makes  the blood thicker and wrathful. It seems to strengthen it's vessel in the beginning, but after extensive research, it kills the host an moves on. A plague that creates wrath instead of fear...It is airborn, passing on from vessel to vessel. Everyone here who had anger towards Gravlor in this fight would be infected. Those who wanted his salvation should be clean. So if you wanted him dead and was within ten feet of him, you would be infected.This goes for anyone here, even the the Dryad. It may not awaken, and simply use you as a carrier till it found a vessel worthwhile. For some reason, birds seem to flock the area consuming anything that it kills. We don't know if they are cursed or just cleansing the land preventing it's spread. Most birds are immune to it's effects for some reason...To fully defeat it would be great, but unless you can contain it, it will spread. One good thing if there is not enough destruction created, the curse will move on, leaving you with a lesser form of the disease, the anger only really coming out when it's a legit reason. This version of the disease won't change your physical appearance and survival is 90%. Of course, when Trogdor's Anger comes out, the disease will take a slight toll on your body. So don't mad too much, you might think you're strong, but you're regret it in the end. So honestly, you've got to either master it and use it like a weapon, which is highly unlikely; or, you can be it's bitch for awhile, get your ass whooped live Gravlor and Trogdor, and if you're energy is high enough, turn into a dragon one day. Can't say that 100%, but one person in the studies did begin forming scales and their bones density to that of a dragons. They wen't insane and beat their selves to death by banging into the wall too many times in one of their fits...I think if we found someone to master Trogdor's Anger, we could figure out how the airborne version of the disease spreads, whether by breathe or by pores. The a treatment could be formed to stop the airborne disease via Medical Science or Magical Science. Do you think you could master this curse if you had it? You'll have to have someone around who can handle you, but we could apply our knowledge to this...experiment, and you could be the physically strongest man in the Overworld with someone the best judgement; only because I believe your mind will build a filter to cipher out the good ideas from the bad ideas. The mind is more powerful than the body, and this would push your mind to a new level.Who knows, maybe you would be able to ascend one day as a god and be able to bless your people beyond what you could do as a man...Does this interest you, or will I have to kill you to prevent you from doing what Gravlor and Trogdor have done, possibly to your own people? This isn't to be disrespectful, but this is why I am here, to make sure this curse doesn't spread to another strong being... And you fit the description of what i'm here to do. If I recall, I witnessed it try and go for Raena, so this is all very plausible towards reason of infection. As the most knowledgeable on this topic, and being the only person to single handily bring it to it's knees, I am most suited to be here, not as the Pharoah, as a specialist on this. Gravlor needs to leave now to prevent a reverse infection, spreading back to him if it's survived... Lady with the bird, I suggest you go with Gravlor if he let's you, you don't need to get infected. If not, I could teach you Phoenix Magic, a magic known by the one and only.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"I'll pass on that offer, sir...

I'll come...\" Shoulders sunken, she started to walk in Zaltos' direction. But then she hesitated and pulled out a magic scroll, which contained a powerful water spell.\"Hang on.\"She petted Blackbean and placed the scroll in its mouth. Then she gestured towards the forest. The creature flew off. Jun meanwhile raised up her hands and revealed her gauntlets. Underneath her cloak one could see the scepter glowing at the small of her back, releasing a powerful surge of energy through the chains that connected to her wrists. Jun concentrated with all her might for many seconds. After all, water wasn't her forte at all.\"Water Art: Aqua Bomb!\" A swirl of blue energy appeared between her wrists that quickly congealed into a physical mass of clear water. She hurled the mass towards the sky over the forest. The shimmering mass was still quite bright, looking like a glittering snowball rather than concentrated water. At the same time it made a wooshing sound as it absorbed more water from the ambient atmosphere, augmenting its power.Next came the hard part.  Jun would gather up even more mana and focus on Blackbean, specifically the magic rune that she had placed on his back. There was an electric blue flash and Jun disappeared, reappearing on top of Blackbean.\"Oh... crap didn't think this through. Hope I can teleport one last time.\" She took the scroll from Blackbean's mouth and broke its seal, just as the water bomb made it to the area above the fire. She watched it detonate and released a blast of water over the fire, raining down on it like an intangible umbrella.Next came the fun part. Jun jumped.This spell would released a powerful shock wave of water in all directions. She jumped and thrust the scroll open. By casting it in midair she would give the water maximum distance while avoiding hurting Blackbean. Sure enough, the blast, which would have caused a small flood on the ground, erupted into a sphere of water that turned oblong and draped the forest fire below on the other side. Now there were two blasts of water to help put the fire out.When Jun cast her spell, she floated in midair for a second. But now she was once again falling, and tried once again to focus on Blackbean for a second teleport-\"Ack!\" Blackbean, however, had other plans. In an astonishing burst of supernatural speed, the creature had darted out of the way of her spell and circled back, grabbing Jun's thigh before she reached terminal velocity. \"Wow, nice catch! Also, ow, ow ow ow ow OW.\" Unfortunately, Blackbean's claws were digging into her inner thigh.The pain prompted Jun to teleport back to Zaltos' side before Blackbean could actually get there. But once again...*thump*\"Ouch.\"Jun teleported several feet off the ground, and landed with a thump... again.She looked back towards her handiwork. The fire was hopefully subsiding. She rubbed her head and her inner thigh.  \"There was probably an easier way to do that. Ok... let's go. Thanks Blackbean.\"The creature faded away, back into the darkness from where it came.She turned to Jorech. \"It's nothing personal, if my little stunt was an indication of my good will and neutrality. Please, leave the Land-Tiller's Expanse out of this war, that is, if you really are gonna go through with it. Good bye sire.\"She left with Zaltos, muttering to herself. \"All I wanted was to find a goddamn dragon...\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Jun was dumbstruck.

He knew the anger would only feed the situation and push him to attacking the man right then and there. Jorech would not take away the honor of fighting for Aaedan's pride from his people. And he would not make them fight alone. Jorech would be on the front. For in Aaedan the king leads from the front and dies with his men. That is how Jorech's father \"died\" and how his father died and so on. Jorech would follow this tradition and die on the battlefield. If this war failed Jorech was sure his people would die resisting the Phoenix. If nothing else he had to make the Phoenix know that The Lion would never be it's prey. <exit>", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"Minor?!
