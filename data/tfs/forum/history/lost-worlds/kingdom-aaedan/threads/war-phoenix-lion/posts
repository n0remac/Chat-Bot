The man's clothes are tattered and torn. His left arm is barely attached and blood spatters on the floor as he moves up to the throne. \"My King, the enemy is at the northern border. I could not tell their number as they discovered me. We fought but I escaped.\" Jorech stood from his throne, scale mail beneath his armor rustling as he moved. He lifted his war maul with one hanf and placed it on his shoulder with a mighty grunt. \"Go the mages, they will heal your arm. Rest while you can, if the fighting makes it to the city, you will have to fight.\" The soldier bowed and exited the blood trail following his exit. Jorech marched across the granite floors of his room and out into the main hallway of his palace. He marched following the blood as he did so, the crimson highlighted on the polished marble. The gates to the palace opened and Jorech stepped out into the plaza. Here is where a small number of his men were gathered. Many already were stationed outside the city waiting for the order to assemble. The men before him were some of the more notable knights of Aaedan. They would follow the king without orders to do so. They knew where the king was going. A small army of medium infantry marched behind the King. The road out of the White City was paved with polished red stones. To Jorech it looked like a river of blood that he was marching through. The marble buildings on both sides of the street held on lookers. Before he knew Jorech was surrounded on both sides by Aaedanians, eyes a glow, cheering him on. They reminded him of what the war was really about. If he did not crush the Phoenix, they would be their victims. The walls to city, fifty foot high twenty foot wide blocks of solid granite loomed before him. The dull steel metal gates that barred his way lifted and Jorech marched out of the city. As he did so several cavalry fell in behind him.The skies were over cast and grey but the green and vibrant hills of Aaedan kept their color in the gloom. Tall green grass poked up on either side of the path. These hills hid many of Jorech's men. They for the most part joined him in the march to the northern border. The hills would give way to a large flat area known as the Aaedanian Plain. The plains ended where the forest that coated the northern border of Aaedan began. Here King Jorech saw what he had expected. Several rangers fleeing the forest as per his orders. The enemy was close. Jorech looked to one of the Legates that had accompanied him and the soldier immediately set to getting the troops from marching into battle lines. 1,000 Infantry men made a line 10 men deep and 100 men wide. They were positioned between two of the last hills to grace the plains. Their front line consisted of Heavy Infantry, their large Shields and long spears ready for orders. The rest were medium infantry. Medium sized shields with shorted spears and long swords stood ready for the battle. On the hills beside this formation, 500 archers on each side, took their places. 5 men deep and 100 men wide. Only 100 riders stood in view of the forest. The remaining of Jorech's forces stayed in the hills waiting for command. They consited of 500 additional infantry, another 1,000 archers, 400 cavalry, and 80 portable ballistae that could be placed on hill top and fire volleys of various types of projectiles at any notice. Jorech stood infront of his army. He spoke loud so all could hear. \"Men and women of Aaedan. We find ourselves standing before a mighty foe. Let us prove that the Lion is mightier!\" The men on the front cheered. the hidden ones stayed quiet, their orders were to do so. Jorech walked into the frontline making sure that a shield would be able to protect him if the enemy fired a volley from the forest.

If a leader ever stood out, it was Zaltos himself in full armor. In the Overworld, he had been seen in light armor, battle armor, but never his full Phoenix Armor. His armor had a base color of a crimson red. Each piece of armor plating was decorated with a yellow brass, adding flare and intimidation effects to his armor. The armor was a very fine representation of Zaltos, the Phoenix, and the Republic States of Phoenixia.The air around him was blurry, the ground steamed and smoked beneath his feet, and the bark on the trees within a foot of him would ember. With every step he took, he left a mark of his power. Bursts of fire would erupt from him at different points, as if trying to catch something of fire. With one steady breeze through the forest, a wildfire could erupt.\u00a0In his right hand he carried a broadsword crafted of unknown metals that stretched eight feet. Down the center of this was a gold piece with engravings of the Celestial language and Cuneiform. The sword was a representation of his age and power, rumored to posses the same power as the first Phoenix, Zaltos being the second Phoenix. He would carry this mighty sword in one hand, as if it was light as a feather.In his left hand he carried a shield that was shaped like a triangle. On the front of this shield was a Phoenix with the All Seeing Eye of God on it's chest. Inside the All Seeing Eye of God was the Eye of Ra. This shield matched his armor. This shield was highly enchanted, capable of absorbing and reflecting large amounts of magic all while being able to withstand the jaws of a dragon.Behind the mighty Pharoah who stood about seven feet in height, was an army. They were garbed in an armor with golden sand and copper tone to it. Throughout the army was an array of soldiers with varying weapons and experience. Despite the speech, Zaltos knew that there was a few fresh recruits. He couldn't waste most of his veterans in a battle of the border, they were needed for others battles.In the front was a large company of 350 mounted soldiers, the cavalry of the Republic States of Phoenixia. They rode upon the mount The Phoenix State used themselves, the Archaniox Rhino. This specific company of mounts were armed with glaves extending eleven feet in length(weapon in picture) and other various pole arms. A force design to run through the front line with little resistance. These soldiers had extra focus in the armor surrounding their calves, ribs, left shoulder that they lead their body on the mount, and chest; the main spots that would be struck in close range combat.Behind this company of 350 cavalry was an astounding force of archers numbering about 500. They were skilled archers, and they were ready for battle. They carried their bows in the hands, ready for orders. They marched in the shadows of the cavalry, trying to keep themselves hidden. Each archer's arrows were dipped in poison from the Giant Tarantula's glands. One slice from this arrow and death was upon them.\u00a0In position, behind these archers, was a force of 1,450 foot soldiers. Many carried swords and shields, but there was a mixture of polearms, dual sword users, and broadsword users. Designed for destruction, these soldiers showed no mercy on an enemy, working like a well oiled machine on the battlefield. Even with such a mixture, shields did line the front, creating a wall.In the mix of these soldiers were two high powered mages as well as four low level mages. These mages would generally carry a healing spell or shield spell. The soldiers closest to them would be the hardest to kill, as if they were juggernauts. With light armor, these mages relied on the soldiers and their magic.As the force moved forward, a series of siege weapons would move to the front of the foot soldiers, adding another row of defense to take on their front lines. Unlike the Aaeden's and their ballista, the Republic States of Phoenixia preferred the catapult. With ten large catapults and twenty smaller catapults, they would capitalize on the destructive force of these old fashion air strikes.In the lands to their east, a second force was readying to combat the enemy when the time came. Five hundred more archers kept quiet. This force was to act like snipers. They would wait to see if any flanking maneuvers would be attempted by Aaeden, and if so, they were to rain hell upon their forces. If the time never came, they would do nothing.\u00a0The archers in the east, another company was in the West. This company was the actual force that Zaltos set up to flank the enemy. With 335 more mounted soldiers and 1,535 foot soldiers, they would wait for the battle to begin. They would attack regardless, but preferably after the front lines of the enemy were broke. They would also initiate their attack should the enemy be able to overpower their brethren.\u00a0Behind the entire force, was a medical squadron. These were non-combat beings who would treat both sides of the battle. In their mind, war was wretched, and they needed to help all they could. While others were taking it, they were trying to save it. This force hoped that Aaeden would acknowledge their neutrality and use them..............And the line was drawn....The first formation of military force under the Republic State of Phoenixia made their way from the woodlands, at least most of them. The flags filled the air, creating a gold and white sea full of Phoenix symbols. Their sight was astounding. Setting up positions with the same filing system they marched in, it would definitely match, if not overwhelm the size of the Aaedens visible force.\u00a0From an outside perspective, it would surely be a spectacle. Half the field covered with blue and gold Aaeden flags, and the other with gold and white Phoenixian flags. Even with a few hundred yards apart, the tension could be cut with a knife. Two proud nations, both fighting for completely different reasons, but both reasons that their people supported.Zaltos stood in the front, looking across to that of Jorech. He'd take a flag from the nearest soldier and plant it in the ground. Zaltos would stand behind this flag, allowing Jorech to only get glimpses. With the flag flapping in the wind, Zaltos would look like he was standing inside a gold and white flame. Above him, an eagle of some sort would let out a mighty scream.\"Men... it is time to make an offering to the Six Faces, an offering that will show them what will become of them! Let us send those that threaten our freedom and people to the pits of Hell to suffer under the will of Amun Ra! PREPARE FOR BATTLE!\"With that, the soldiers finished their positioning and began to take their stance. They would pound on their armor, creating a sound that echoed like ten thousand drums on the back of a thousand elephants. They would shout 'Amun-Ra' in unison. This was their way to build moral while trying to intimidate their enemies. They all knew that their life could be over in the next few minutes, but they'd face it with the mentality that death was their bitch.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/cybernations/images/2/25/TPFflag.png/revision/latest?cb=20100124164930", "http://captura.cubava.cu/files/2015/04/Dota-2-Heroes-Dragon-Knight-4-Cool-HD.jpg", "http://warband.ya1.ru/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/medieval-army-1024x576.jpg", "https://hdwallpapers.cat/wallpaper_mirror/war_rhino_magic_warrior_fantasy_abstract_hd-wallpaper-1897948.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><br><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/cybernations/images/2/25/TPFflag.png/revision/latest?cb=20100124164930\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/><br/><br/>\"In the name of your Forefathers, those that were my brothers in forging our free land, we must fight!

The volley wouldn't go unnoticed by him or his men. He'd throw his left arm up, placing his shield at a sixty degree angle in the direction of the arrows. The chest beating would stop and the shields would raise up. All the shields would be at the same angle as Zaltos's. They take a knee, and their ranks would temporarily tighten up. \u00a0The archers would split up, hiding behind whatever was closest, whether it was the Archaniox Cavalry or the foot soldiers.\u00a0Thankfully Askar had unintentionally blocked a few arrows. What came down was primarily on the foot soldiers, allowing minimal, if any, losses due to their tight formations. At a kneel, there was less to hit, and placing their shields at angle allowed them to cover one extra person and the knees of the soldier behind them. One could hear the heavy armor clashing in their quick and forceful defense. As the last arrow fell, the shields broke back into their proper formation. As the archers moved from their protection, the drew back on the strings of their bows and aimed high. They waited for the command they expected to follow before releasing.Zaltos would let out orders, yelling like a dragon across the battleground, \"FIRE!\"As the Phoenixian Archers took their final step into their original spot, their fingers let go. The strings made a deep sound, but the arrows screamed. These arrows were not regular arrows. They had been dipped in an oil that was highly flammable, and with enough friction, it would catch fire. The arrows were armor piercing tipped. Instead of two blades, there were four. The arrows would appear as normal arrows as they shot high into the sky, having barely any slope on them. The intention was for the arrows to come down as straight as they could. Three quarters of their way down in their descent, due to the high friction from coming down straight and faster due to the gravity, they would ignite, becoming fire tipped. Even if these arrows didn't kill anyone, they had a high chance of sticking where they hit in the armor. The intentions here were to smoke them out and possible force removal of some armor from the heat of the arrowhead. The fire would catch the wooden stretch of the arrow on fire to turn into an ember. The wood would ember and smoke, and when they moved, the air would fuel the embers making more smoke. The arrows that struck the ground wouldn't do anything because the impact would place the tips below the ground and extinguish the flames.\u00a0The moment the Phoenixian Archers released their shot, they fell back through the ranks of the foot soldiers to the backline. The mounts had a few arrows in them, but their armor and thick hide allowed them to take the hits. What did hit, if the soldiers could reach it, they'd remove it. \u00a0Zaltos would then roar across the field again, \"READY FOR BATTLE!\"Their feet stomped and their swords slapped the front of their shields. The sun reflected a blinding effect as the glaives swung upwards and forward to their position. The foot soldiers would come in behind the Archaniox Cavalry, tightening up the formation. A large, Archaniox Cavalry lead ground force stood, ready to attack or defend. They were on foreign soil and they wouldn't rush in on an enemy, no matter how confident they were.One of the stronger mages within the visible ranks was preparing his own works. The end of his staff was glowing a bright red color and his armed pulsed with this same energy. Battle was coming about and he knew he needed to gather energy to counter any enemy mages or defend their troops. The other mage was in one of the flanking companies, readying his energy in his own way.\u00a0\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/cybernations/images/2/25/TPFflag.png/revision/latest?cb=20100124164930"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><font face=\"georgia\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/cybernations/images/2/25/TPFflag.png/revision/latest?cb=20100124164930\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/><br/></font></div>"}, "post-13605": {"user": null, "user_num": null, "timestamp": "1444860615000", "message": "The Aaedanian Army was well trained against arrow barrages, often using live fire excersises to practice aim and defense.

While the armor peircing arrows would have ripped through the steel shell, the wood would not be so easily thwarted at that range. Many arrows would be stuck in Aaedan's shield, their flaming shafts licking the steel, but they would prove unharmed. The Archers were not as lucky. Though made the same way, their shields were smaller. Their column formation wouldn't allow them to tighten ranks enough for the smaller shields to protect themselves completely. They took a knee and held their shield up. Upper shoulders and ankles would be hit, aswell as the cloaks they wore so proudly. Several of them dropped dead right there. Others were set aflame and had to remove their cloaks or die.No officers died in the attack however, a stroke of luck. Jorech spoke to his legate, \"Have a volley, half of our weapons, fire into their formation with stones. When they hit the formation, have our archers fire another volley.\" The Legate nodded and spread the word. And when it reached the rear a series of flags would waive to the ballistae, transferinng orders and where their targets where. The only command the Phoenix would hear would be officers ordering the archers, \"Nock Arrows! Draw! Hold!\" Jorech would take command of the infantry. \"Phalanx!!!\" The Aaedanians put their sheilds out in front of them, the frontline had short spears ready, the next two, long spears. The spears would sit between the shields of their brethren. \"Forward March!\" Jorech would move with them. Their first step was no sooner taken, then sounds of Ballistae fireing. Like massive bows a series of loud sounds echoed from a short distance behing the, from the Phoenix's veiw, right side of the battle. Second step taken by the infantry would be greeted with massive stone balls flying over the eastern formation of the Lion's archers. They hit the ground in front of the Phoenix's main formation and rolled/bounced into it. They would shatter bones, knock men aside, perhaps even temporarily break their formation. Third step of the infatry was met by an Aaedanian officer's cry, \"LOOSE!\" The twinge of bows being fired echoed once more across the plains. Fourth step of the infantry. They black rain as arrows rained down on the Phoenix. Jorech's Infantry was advancing upon their foe while missiles rained down upon the Phoenix.

The wooded shafts would ember and produce a light smoke. As the wood burned, it carried a pine scent to it. As Pine's are known for, their smoke would carry an acidic burn to the eyes. The smoke was light, but if the smoke got in their helms, it would make breathing a bit harder and make their eyes water. An annoyance more than anything.As for the ballista to their right, there was little to be done about it. The large arrow like projectiles would find themselves planted into the cavalry. These large beasts, when they fell, would act like a wall that protected the mass of foot soldiers and the cavalry behind the front line. A loss, but they knew what to do.\u00a0As the ballista fired, Zaltos was shouting his commands, \"Return fire!\"No sooner than the Aaeden military could take their second step, their siege weapons returned fire. The catapults had become hidden in the ranks of the infantry and blocked by the cavalry. Twelve of the smaller catapults would release an assault from fifty riverstones that were a good size. These stones with their size and momentum, would knock soldiers to the ground, shatter bones, and possibly even kill some. \u00a0Damage to any siege was capable, depending on what it was made of and where the shots hit.Volleying behind these shots was a larger display of stones, four of them primarily aimed at their visible ballista. These larger catapults could knock out five or six ballista each if they hit right. If not, they'd still hurt what soldiers were around the weapons. \u00a0In the same time the catapults released, so did Aaeden's. The cavalry would take the brunt of this hit again, many of the mounts getting struck. What riders were capable, joined the infantry near a mage. All the cavalry could do was reform their ranks as if nothing happened. They'd worry about the dead later.\u00a0As Jorech yelled his commands, the soldiers readied their shields. The soldiers would take their defensive stance to the arrows again. This time, the formation was much tighter due to not having the archers to cover. A few soldiers had received an arrow to their shins or feet. Some knocked down and some just in pain.\u00a0\"Archers!\" Zaltos shouted in response the round of arrows released from Aaeden.\u00a0The archers, would fire their arrows one more time, but from a further back distance. They would not get to the temperature needed to catch fire, so they'd just be armor piercing rounds. In this time, the soldiers who had to defend from the enemy arrows would take position again. The archers were more or less being used for 'cover' to create the time.Zaltos would raise his sword to the sky. He lifted it slowly, demonstrating his strength by lifting the large broadsword. The Phoenixian soldiers seemed to take a more aggressive stance, as if waiting for a signal. Archaniox Rhino's began grunting and roaring, antsy themselves.\u00a0The mage within the visible ranks spell began to take effect. The air around the Phoenixian army would begin to get hotter. This high level mage was trying to make the soldiers more comfortable, while making the enemy uncomfortable when they met ranks. They were bring a home field advantage to an away game.The other mage in the flanking ranks would continue to gather energy. The mages knew more about what was to go on in this battle than any soldier. This mage knew he had a much more important duty than fighting any enemy directly.\u00a0At the medical camp...The medical camp had been set up and what injured soldiers the Phoenixians had, they were sent here. Most would get bandaged and readied to go back into battle. Others, who had more serious injuries from the ballista and catapults, were lucky to even make it to this came.This medical camp had beings in unmarked uniforms that they sent to the Aaeden forces to try and convince them to let them aid their wounded.
