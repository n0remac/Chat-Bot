The smell and sounds of the city above would become more audible: here they were relatively close to the surface. The path diverged three ways here: To the right was a somewhat steep upward tunnel.

If a person was familiar with the geography of the city they would realize it likely came from deeper within the city: it was one of the tributaries of the main aquaduct. There was no forward route, but there was a sewer grate above which shone light from the streets above onto the junction. A rusted iron ladder led up to the streets above... and below, to another level of the sewers. Evidently someone had been squatting here just moments ago. rough wood planks had been laid out over the stone, along with some hay for bedding. An open bottle of cheap liquor sat next to bedding: evidently whomever had left had left in a hurry urgent enough to abandon their home and alcohol. Across from the squatter's bedding was a rough mural crudely painted on the wall directly adjacent to the ladder. It depicted a symbol similar to the potion-monger's tattoo: a mole's claw.

Sometimes a sheet would slide aside and a person would emerge from the wall like a termite from it's hole. Small caverns had been dug into the stone walls of the tunnel, leaving pockets that contained shops and dwelling areas. In a civilized part of the world, these would be crawl spaces.

At points planks had been laid out over the river of refuse, allowing one to walk across from one side of the canal to the other, or to create more space for the merchants. Of all the establishments, one immediately stood out as unique. Rather than being roughly cut into the walls, it appeared to be an original part of the sewer's design.

Over his lean body was ensnared in a loose overcoat over which a gaudy looking half-cape of gilded gold and deep emerald was hung. Over his black locks was a crude looking crown of hammered copper: a piece not worthy of a blacksmith's son, let alone a \"king\". He had draped himself sideways in the wide chair, his legs hanging off of one side.\"I see you have arrived in one piece, Praetor-Rex Raynold Takans. How can this humble king be of service to our allies.\"He spoke smugly and with irony, a thin smile gracing his lips.

From one of the passageways leading out of the room came two men. They carried a man bound in wrist manacles. Two more men came soon after, carrying another similarly bound prisoner. The men were clearly beaten and bloodied, and one was missing an eye. \"The thugs.

Not everything can be, or should be, acquired through violence or intimidation. But you are here for information, not advice. A shame, really. Killing one of my citizens was a very bad idea.\"He sauntered off his throne, drawing strange looking curved blade as he did.

The disgusting creature was nibbling on something... a piece of meat, perhaps? The King looked back up, his eyes momentarily glowing a dazzling emerald before they returned to normal. To Raena he would respond next. \"Oh, paranoia is no curse. A Knight such as yourself should know that. Xys uai qylyf's yghypsefr swez.

When the frankly disgusting smelling smoke dissipated the man would be gone, vanished. In his place was a simple wooden chest, sitting alone on the throne. The guards shook their heads in exasperation. Meanwhile in the tunnel, Takans would run down the first of the thugs, nailing him in the back with a swipe of his bladed forearms. The scum would collapse in the grime of the catacomb floor as his companion disappeared around the corner. The kid was fast.
