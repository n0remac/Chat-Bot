The first 3 weeks was that and that alone. At the end they could sprint the circumference of the White City ten times without a break. Several of the cadets dropped out at his point leaving only 40 of the original 52.Then it moved into a new area. Weapons and armor training. The new introduction however was to runed arrows, fire grenades, throwing knives, duel wielding, and firing mulitple arrows at once. Ranger armor was different from the armor the cadets were used to. The armor was designed for both stealth and quick movement. The plates covered the upper chest and back, shoulders, thighs, shins, forearms and upper arms. The plates are covered in brown leather to hide their shine. The neck of the shirt armor came up over the mouth and a metal plate with holes it covered their nose mouth chin cheeks and jaws. The cloth in the armor was tight by design loose only at the joint to provide better movement. Several leather straps were built into the armor to hold the various weapons Rangers use. The cloak was not cloth but a heavy, though suple, leather that was dyed a mottled green and grey. The cloak would hang down just behind the knees and could come down and around the body to provide warmth or camouflage. The cloak of course had hood that would rest lightly on the wearers head. A leather strap could be tied from beneath the chin however to preven the hood from coming off in fast wind or battle. Considering the hood provided the only armor for the top and back of a ranger's head; the strap is, more often than not, in use. The Ranger Cadets would spend the next several weeks practicing with these new weapons. Equipping and unequiping their armor. Cleaning their equipment even if it was clean. As the training progressed they were still forced to run every morning and night a minimum of 10 laps around the circumference of the city. The result was mental exhaustion. The point being to train the cadets to function with their gear even if pushed beyond their limits. Only 20 Cadets were left.  Their training would continue into the classroom adding 3 hours a day of classes covering plants, animals, maps and additional medical studies. The training cycle of \"run, practice, study, practice, run, clean equipment\" became the norm for the cadets. Their number of 20 would remain strong throughout the rest of their training. By the end of this round of training a year had passed. Though their training was technically incomplete they had got through the worst. The rest of their training would be done in the field.
