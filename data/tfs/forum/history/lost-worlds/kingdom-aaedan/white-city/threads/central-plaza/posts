Like a child she was, though a little to tall to fit in seamlessly with the group of local youngsters coming on to join her happy dance. The priest smiled softly as he called out to her from a distance brought them by Wild's swift movements chasing down puddles. \"Having fun?\" His expression widened as he found that somehow he'd tapped into a subject worth listening to while he spoke of the city and its many offers. The look on her face suggested that the curious little elf was listening to him intently when he told her about the Academy of Magic, particularly. \"Indeed there is,\" he answered her question. \"There's a school somewhere for every subject you can imagine being taught to eager students by wise mentors or teachers - why would there not be a school specializing in teaching magic?\"Joseph looked at the child, eyebrows crooked and eyes shining with pure delight upon what he took as Wild's scholarly desire to visit the Academy as the very first thing she would see during her stay here in the White City. \"Then you wish to become a student?\" he asked, his face starting to feel numb from all the smiling he did. If she truly were going to enroll into the student body, there was the thrilling image on his mind that he might run into her again when he would come searching for reading material to compliment his own courses.As the girl gestured toward her dirty clothes being the most obvious reason why she was going to look for a tavern, Joseph could do little more than nod. It was easy to see how the girl was suffering from some sort of predicament; and he'd made it his guess already that she didn't have much money to afford tending to her most basic needs. At least not until someone offered her a job. Alas, the vicar himself was in no position to do so; and so he was merely left addressing an higher power on her behalf; praying to it that Wild would be granted a favorable opportunity. \"If you won't mind me coming along for the tavern later, I will cover the cost for us both.  No, really I am only doing myself a favor as I haven't had such lively company for weeks.\"\"Yes, there's a lot of choices, indeed,\" Joseph agreed. \"I am going to pay the Academy a visit myself, as I hope to find some books relating to subjects I have studied for a few years already.

Besides it's always a great thing to familiarize oneself with the local deities, gaining their favor, as well as that of their people.\"Another smile lit up his face when his young companion spoke of the treasure buried by the rainbow's end.

I promise I will repay you as soon as I can find a job.\"She smiled when the priest spoke of a temple he wished to visit. She was not very religious herself, but respected those who still had a faith in spite of what life had done to them. \"Enjoy your visit to the temple, my friend,\" she smiled. \"I will visit the Academy while you are at the Temple.

A crystal was the source of the magic, a crystal hidden away fro centuries by the last occupants of the White City. The fight for control of the city's core was all the more important. They could end this blight by taking the Palace of Aeon and destroying the crystal in the tower. Her soldiers did as all Aaedanians do when an arrow volley is launched at them. They raised their shields and made a ceiling out of them. The arrows would do minimal damage to the 3rd Legion as the men were trained in live fire situations against the same archers. The rangers sniping from the buildings however were far more deadly. With their shields raised to the sky their flanks were exposed and vulnerable to the rangers near perfect shots.

Slowly the began to organised once more, crawling from under piles of dead, or reattaching severed arms to bodies. Slowly they made their way under Ralakors floating body. Forming once more perfect bronze blocks. The armor dent and shorn, but the bodies whole once more.The gate opened wide before him, the Queen calling for the aid of the allies.

They were not his allies... They were simply the enemies of his enemies.\u00a0Then General Finch addressed him - ordered him! His eyes flared up and the shadows of the already dark alley in which he stood grew darker, then expanded out a foot into the street. Elizabeth would find a creeping, chilling terror crawl up her spine as the mysterious man glared at her in anger, subsiding only when he moved his eyes to look away.\u00a0\"You do not give me orders. You may have the body of a woman, but to me you are little more than a child playing soldier in the street.\"His voice had a calmness that had betrayed the slight clenching of his facial muscles and the widening of his eyes, yet he said nothing more than that. Rather he sprung into action, darting across the plaza towards one of the open purge doors like a gust of sharp wind. He stopped for a mere tenth of a second outside; pushing away the soldiers near it then darting down into the tunnels beneath them.Down there, in the damp and the dark, his cloak loosened from his form and razor-like claws that tipped his pale fingers came into view. The undead would no-doubt notice him immediately, but they would not be able to stop him; the man's visage would turn gruesome in the dark, his growls echoing out into the streets while claw and tooth tore through rotting flesh and snapped through bones. Down one tunnel he flew, then the next, each one leaving a trail of newly re-deceased dead in a matter of seconds. When he did encounter the mages, they would offer little more resistance to him than their minions did, for their magic could not be cast quick enough to catch the pale figure who melted into the shadows like darkness and struck with the ferocity of an unnatural predator.\u00a0Indeed the mages would fall, their skulls opened and brains destroyed; staffs and chimes broken and charged power released harmlessly back into the undercurrents of the world. Then when he finally believed he killed the last one, his body dispersed into a swarm of hundreds of bats that flew down every tunnel in the plaza at once to claw and bite at every possible surviving creature that he missed. Like flying piranhas, they cut through anything still moving one bite at a time on their journey back towards the light of the open purging doors... And when they spilled back out into the streets above ground, they swarmed up into the air above the plaza and rejoined into Leviath's single body.\"My power here is limited,\" he told them, repeating his words from before while he hovered in the sky. \"So you all shall have to do the rest. Be thankful that I at least chose to reveal myself and do this much, for otherwise you may well have met your destruction. Go and defeat the rest of these undead creatures; purge the city of their presence so that I do not have to return here and do so with an army of my own at my back. It is not yet time for the Revenants to return, but I will not suffer rivals when finally it is. If you do well in this task, and do not fail me, I shall reward the worthy with the infinite power of my blood; if you do, then I shall drink your own and leave you a lifeless husk on the ground to be forgotten by the annals of history.\"Slowly, as he stared down at all those gathered in the plaza, his body once more fell apart piece by piece; each turning winged, black and into another part of the flying swarm. When no more of his human form remained, the swarm took flight away from the plaza and left them to their own devices.

He gave his life for them.\" He waved an arm to the three people who landed the finishing blows on Jorech, they were still recovering. He waved his arms to the soldiers all around, any who were injured now healed. \"He even helped them all.\" He looked down at her, his eyes still watery, \"He gave me message for you,\"He took a knee coming to eye level with her, \"He wanted you to know that he loves you just as your parents did, and that he is very proud of you.\" He waited a moment, \"You were the among his last thoughts, I am sorry.\" <br><br/>Aegon stood once more. He left the young girl to mourn and walked to Nyx. He removed his robe and covered the recovering queen and helped her stand, \"Your men love you, if nothing else that would be enough. Your land is destroyed, you are among the most noble and brave people I have ever seen and yet this tragedy had befallen you and yours.\" He walked with her towards the ruins of the palace, \"If I may...\" He reached his one hand out to the collapsed building, a wave of magic exiting his hand and coursing through the rubble. He closed his hand into a fist and the sound of rubble shifting about was heard. A flash of teleporting magic and Aegon held an item in his hand. Low and behold the crown of Aaedan, a silver cloak made from a lion pelt. It was dirty and dusty. Aegon took a knee, folding the lion cloak with a bit of simple magic and a smooth move of his single arm. He offered it to the queen, \"Your lands may be gone but the spirit of Aaedan will live on through you, take your cloak, Queen Nyx Mann, Lichbane.\" <br/><div class=\"quote_clear\"></div></br></div></div>The queen no swathed in the traveler's robes looked down at the man, the cloak he offered was the equal of a crown, Aaedan's crown. Someone would need to lead her people through the hardships to come. She took the cloak and threw it across her shoulders. She looked out to every one in the plaza. Isranians, Land Tillers, Berlovians, Gauldanians, and her own people. People who came and purged the White City of the undead, people who came to the Aaedanian's aid when it was needed most. <br/><br/>She walked slowly to her father's warmaul. She stopped before it, \"I cannot possibly pay back what was done here for Aaedan today. Rather, I would ask for another favor. Go back to your lands. Ask your Kings, your Queens, your Senates for their presence. I ask them to gather in Isra,\" she looked at General Finch, \"If they will have me.\" She looked down at her fathers war-maul, Aegon's arm still next to it along with a large pool of his blood. <br/><br/>She gripped the maul, her eyes suddenly went full blue, glowing brilliantly, a blue smoke rolling out of them. With a grunt she lifted the mighty weapon with on hand. \"Aaedan is dead! Last Legion, sac the city! Take all the gold and jewels!!\"<br/><div class=\"quote_clear\"></div></div></div>"}, "post-40893": {"user": "Ralakor Overlord of Belrow", "user_num": 1360, "timestamp": "1465553046000", "message": "The black ooze had no power over Ralakor when the Dead king exploded.
