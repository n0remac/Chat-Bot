He would attempt to draw the undead into a tight funnel near the gate, making them easier to manage and destroy by limiting the numbers they would have to fight at any given moment.The falconers would be interspersed with the mounted mages and archers. The mages would begin to gather energy for an offensive while the archers would switch to their shortbows, weapons designed for close range combat. They would should in between the legs of the earth titans, who would form a front line defense against the hoards of undead. The archers could hold multiple arrows in their draw hands and fire them in rapid succession, slowing down the zombies by strikes their rotting limb bones or head. Two archers would maintain their long bows to help snipe any particularly nasty undead which their strategy couldn't handle immediately.Raynor would begin to cast an enchantment to help the mounted archers do their work more effectively.The knights of the harvest would maintain at the rear and sides and a few in the front, ready to intercept any undead that came their way or got passed the titans, who would do their best to crust, stomp, and behead any undead that would approach them .The psionic corp members, although there were only two, would remain at the very center and keep their forces coordinated.Most importantly, the falconers would unleash their empowered falcons, now bathed in an aura of fire which made them resistant to physical damage, immune to fire damage and allowed them to incinerate undead on contact. \u00a0By dive-bombing them at high speeds, they would also utterly destroy difficult targets while releasing a blast of fire to disrupt or destroy nearby undead. They would fly high into the air and then crash into the ranks of undead in front of the titans at anywhere from 100 to 200 miles per hour (depending on the species; some were faster dive bombers and others were larger and had more powerful fire auras).With 100 falcons and 6 earth titans unleashing constant hell in a tight funnel, the undead would be hard-pressed to get past their line, while hundreds of undead would go down every few seconds.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRb82SrAnIhmG8FEYY-fcroNwiRkMjmrDv0BoSdxiFN1MSlnep6", "http://pureawesome.net/wow/110818_alys2.jpg"], "html": "<Enter from Fortifications>"}, "post-37608": {"user": "Elizabeth Finch", "user_num": 1337, "timestamp": "1463164936000", "message": "The Griffin Riders of 1st Company kept the knights company from above while her Riders-in-Training matched them below.

Indeed the success of their strategy was tentative at best, but with the help of their new friend their position was tenable.Even as they were being overwhelmed, the mounted mage corps was not idle. They unleashed the mana they were gathering in the form of a combination attack of noxious gas and wind. This gas spread up and over the titan battle line like a great leaping wave, and came crashing down upon the hoards of undead. The gas did nothing on its own, but as soon as a spark from one of the falcons or the Serpent of Agni entered the cloud, the wave would transform into yet another eruption of blue fire, just like the one that the Land-Tillers had used to clear the walls.The wave would provide a brief respite for the titans and the Knights of the Harvest by incinerating an entire wave of undead, perhaps a thousand or more. The flames were not only magically empowered, but were based in acetylene gas, which burned at 2500 degrees Celsius. The rain would most likely do nothing to abate it.Raynor himself was at first skeptical, but after a few seconds of assessing the situation realized the Mystic Traveler was an ally.
