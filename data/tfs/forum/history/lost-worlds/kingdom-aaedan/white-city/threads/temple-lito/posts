Very pleased to meet you. Reynad Fletcher, Zoologist extraordinaire.\u201d Giving a hasty bow he clapped his hands. \"Now then! I trust you read the notice? I have summoned you, for a man of notable menace has stolen something held dearly by yours truly.\u201d  With a swift motion, Reynad rolled open the paper.
