A crunching and snapping sound erupted from the monster. Its cranium did not give out but the neck of the monster shattered in several places as the force washed over him. The monster was resoundingly defeated, a limp pile of flesh spread on the marble floor. Blood dripped from its mouth. Its body started to decay rapidly. An effect from the magic. The flesh melted away, bubbling and boiling and running away until the only sign of the monster ever existing was only bones remained.

The Earthwarden had arrived, at the behest of the Land-Tiller's forces; word of an undead horde had reached her via the communicative crystals she'd given out, and she was beyond mad. Mostly because this nation bordered that which she protected, and she wouldn't stand for such a threat so near unto what amounted to her own borders! Landing atop a cluster of buildings, Va'nei coiled her tail around another one to anchor herself and flared her wings, looking down at the human forces below with great golden eyes filled with anger. The wrath of the Earthwarden was a thing to behold.\"I have been told that the source of the threat is housed in that tower. Is that correct?\" The tip of one wing gestured toward the tower of the palace, and she barely waited for a response before fixing her attention upon the structure. \"Stand back! I do not want you harmed when it falls.\" Her body visibly enlarged as she inhaled deeply, and then her toothy maw opened as she exhaled, expelling a torrent of green-gold mist toward the tower. It settled around the vertical structure, then vines began to surround it, digging into crevices and windows and cracks and tightening rapidly, making an alarming sound echo through the plaza, that of cracking stone. Va'nei then uncoiled her tail from around the building which had been steadying her position, and the long, prehensile appendage lashed around with immense speed, slamming into the structurally-compromised tower and sending it toppling away from the plaza. She snorted in a manner that was both pleased and annoyed as she surveyed her work, then looked down upon the humanoid figures below.\"Is there anything further I can do to help?\"Then the whole building started shaking. Nyx peaked into the throne room. The pillars holding the tower were cracking. It was coming down.
