The Harbor is large and can accomodate many ships, though is typically occupied by the common long-ships favored by the Norlanders. It is home too many merchants, and artificers and it is considered the most \"metropolitan\" and developed settlement in all of Norland. Its summers are brief and mild, while the cold chill of winter gradually builds over autumn. The Harbor is well defended by Northern-Militia guards, and merchants, immigrants, and travelers are more loosely checked than the southern Border of the Reinburgh Mountains. One can quickly find a mead-hall/Inn to rest and recoup, and can find very high-quality goods. The Upperkeep and  its manor known as \"Thengard-Hall\" houses the most ornate stone-work in the North, as well as being one of the only northern settlements to feature stone-walls. The icy-waters of this land have bred many prolific explorers, and warriors. The people are hardy and for the most part friendly if gruff and with a flippant and blunt attitude but willing to offer generous hospitality to outsiders.
