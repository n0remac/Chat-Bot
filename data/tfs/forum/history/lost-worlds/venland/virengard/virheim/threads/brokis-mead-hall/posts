It has a boisterous atmosphere, and tends to be crowded, while also known for getting quite rowdy. It offers an assortment of rooms in its basement for those who need accomodations. The Tavern is kept by Broki Brahson whose family has owned the mead-hall for 12 generations. It in turn has a certain cultural significance to natives of the community serving as a familiar and recognizable land-mark of the city and known to travelers the world over. The Brahson clan are not faint of heart either, and the Brahson family serve not only as staff but also as security for when things rarely get a bit too far out of hand. It is worth noting that whoever inherits the hall after its current keeper, symbolically adopts the name \"Broki\" more as a moniker. The patriarch of the family Saint-Broki was said to be generous and brave, and died fighting off forgotten enemies in a minor invasion during the countries dark-ages.It offers the following services:Cheap Inn-Room: (Petty Price)-(Accomodations)It also sells the following items.

The \"It\" she was referring to was an item she had comissioned someone to find. An Aelvish-Artifact that had been lost and spirited out of the realm long ago. She had only trusted someone else to do it, because the artifact itself was obscure, and only the Aelves would know its true nature, so in other words, there was no profit to be had unless it was through the Fae-Folk.
