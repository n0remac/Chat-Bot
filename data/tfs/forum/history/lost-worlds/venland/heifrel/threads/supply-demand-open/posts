He knew how to lead men into battle. He knew about maintaining and controlling a fleet when it was necessary. And yet.....\"You are trying to raise your prices to a ridiculous amount.\" The sharp tone in which he spoke was likely to frighten the stone mason as he glared up at Admiral Ullrich in defiance. \"I need stone masons who are willing to do their job and begin construction once we reach that coast. You'll be paid a fair wage but I won't bankrupt my venture into this new colony just because you see this venture as too much.\" The truth was that Ullrich did understand what was being asked of the man. The Admiral was basically asking for the stone mason to abandon his livelihood in Venland for a chance at something new. And to serve Ullrich across the sea into foreign territory.\"Frankly Yer Highnesses, I ain't fit to abandon my business just because you askin' me to. You might have the government's support but I ain't giving up my livelihood for ya. And don't expect any of the other stoners to be doing it neither. What you're asking for will take years.\"\u00a0What Emeric wanted was for stone castles and fortresses built along a shoreline and also further into a country that was ripe for the taking. Ullrich had no exact destination in mind but it mattered little. The stone mason was likely to deny him this. \"Wooden forts might be your best bet. I know it aint satisfactory and wood burns just like any other if put to the torch, but it's the only way you'll get places built up faster out there. And I ain't no woodsman. Now good day, sir.\" With that said, the stone mason would turn and walk away from the teeth grinding Admiral who turned to walk out the door.Out in the streets of Ziegfried, Emeric couldn't help but be annoyed as he walked along the road alone. Two of his honored guards were behind him with their swords at their hips. He had wanted to save the wood supply that he had accumulated for maintaining of his fleet and not to be used for construction of wooden fortresses. But perhaps it would be better for wooden fortresses to be constructed. And yet, that would require him to go to Virengard to speak to any woodsman who would be willing to travel across the sea.With a sigh escaping his lips, Emeric continued on his way through the streets of Ziegfried with his two guards. He had a few stops to make on this day. This one stone mason had just been the first of many headaches that were likely to happen for the Admiral.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "(For continuity's sake, this will be taking place before Ullrich's venture into the Open Land's thread \"The Beginning of Something New\")"}, "post-70540": {"user": "Venland", "user_num": 2392, "timestamp": "1500063090000", "message": "The streets of Ziegfreid were busy, as the Fleet-Admiral went about his buisness.

He had his answer, and he would be better off talking to Norlanders about this. But the day had something different in store.

The man's right eyebrow rose as he heard that title that had been bestowed on him so long ago. Sea-Baron. He was not a true land baron like these men who haggled and played with men's lives. Instead he was given power on the sea where he could make a difference.\"What could you need my advisement on when it comes to foreigners?\" The fact he was being considered at all was nothing short of a miracle. What could have happened out on the sea to warrant his advisement on this council? The man was suspicious for certain as he just regarded the representative. Was it about taxing incoming trade ships?

When the facts are that they have no rights. They forfeited as much when they chose their life.\" It was a harsh assessment but it was one that Ullrich would give none the less. \"They'll fight.
