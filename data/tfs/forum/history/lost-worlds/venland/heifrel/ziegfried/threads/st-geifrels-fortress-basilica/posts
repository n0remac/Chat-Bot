The Fortress itself serves both as a place of worship and pilgrimage as well as a garrison of highly-trained para-military knights and clerical-magi with access to considerable resources. It in turn is fortified with the Sacred-Mystical arts of the Church which is reinforced by its proximity to the Tree of Midland. It in turn boasts powerful sacred magic defenses, and is manned with ballistae, and catapaults.
