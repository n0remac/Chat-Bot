Together they met the worgs head on. Armored moose, knights, and a single angry man met the worgs in a mighty clash. Steel plated horns biting into the flesh of the worgs, knocking them down and throwing their riders away. Lance piercing flesh of worg and rider alike. Fenris moved between them, cleaving massive wounds into the flesh of his \"kin\" with his massive blade. He cleaved heads, sundered what armor they had and at times left only the lower half of the rider atop the worg. He found himself between two, their attention hard upon the larger threats. With an enraged huff he brought his sword up into the soft belly of one, nearly slicing the beast in half, and down upon the rider of the other, tearing through him and his mount below. In a single swing Fenris had split them both open and slaughtered the riders. Their blood coated the ground upon where Fenris stood. The Knights atop their steeds pressed the battle onward. The worgs were not behaving as they should. The mere presence of Fenris should have driven them away. An instinctual knowing and understanding of who he was should have been weaved into their bones. It was clear to Fenris that something else was controlling them, urging them to murder and serve their masters in ways that simply should not have been possible. Fenris moved to catch up with Eyla moving with swiftness not wanting to lose sight of her or get too far. He sensed this battle had a purpose, and they were in turn probably playing into the hands of whoever had caused this conflict. But as of right now nothing could be done but defend themselves. He stepped closer to Eyla's right flank as she caught up to the knights. As the battle raged Fenris set his eyes, golden and trimmed with black, upon the commander of this attack. On the man that forced Fenris to cover his blade in wolf's blood, the blood of his kin. =====Eyla=====Eyla had done her best to quicken her pace to stay by her new husband's side. Her own great blade catching a wolf that dared to sneak in a strike whilst her man's attention was focused elsewhere. The beast was already wounded, a nearly severed back leg, but its lunge could have been fatal to Fenris. She stopped it. Her attack was a quick double stroke, one to the neck of the wolf, nearly decapitating it and driving it into the ground. The next aimed to the rider which was knocked off his mount's back with a mighty horizontal sweep, nearly slicing him in half just below the ribs. She moved to stand next to Fenris. Her gaze following his to the obvious leader of the attack. If looks could kill the troll would be dead.
