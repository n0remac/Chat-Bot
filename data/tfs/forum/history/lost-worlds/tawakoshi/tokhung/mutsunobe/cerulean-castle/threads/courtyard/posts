If you wish to succeed Nubohide and carry on ruling with the iron fist, who am I to judge you?\" Ezia said and nodded slightly out of respect. Ezia listened intently to Sayaka's question and recognized her own signature on the scroll. The question took a bit of explaining but Ezia was happy elaborate. \"The monks at the House of Reason channel an anti magic barrier to Tokhung that encompasses the city, but in contrary to the natural source of anti magic found at the Shrine of Reason, the channeled anti magic makes... well sort of a sphere around the city. The sphere is only a few meters wide but encapsulates the entire city. This means, that unless an enemy is right in front of your walls - and thus in range of your archers - any long range attempt of harming the city with magic attacks will be nullified.\" Ezia said and looked at Sayaka, hoping that she could follow her explanation. \"Thus you can use magic inside the city all you want, but..!\" Ezia said and lifted her finger. \"Then there's the thing about the barrier stones. You may have seen some odd stones with old writing on them fx at the gate of the castle right outside. They are focusing the anti magic we project at Tokhung and form a denser local environment where magic cannot be used inside a certain perimeter. This is very useful for checkpoints and important gates, where you wouldn't want anyone cloaking themselves for the guards or firing off powerful magic while being screened.\" Ezia concluded. As useful as this was, her experience was that many lords got frightened by the potency that antimagic held. In other words they were afraid that The House of Reason would betray them and strip them from any magical power if someone sought to usurp their position. Ezia was however ready to calm any doubts about that if asked.
