There was no answer, because Miyoko was still gagged, among other things. \u201cWait outside,\u201d Jishu ordered the guards, before kneeling beside Miyoko's trussed body and taking off her gag. She noticed the tracks of tears down her face through the dirt and ash that coloured it. She understood those tears, even though her heart was hardened towards any sympathy for Nobuhide. Her words were soft as usual, though the message behind them was anything but. \u201cChild,\u201d she said, \u201cI know it is difficult to understand, and hard to bear. But you must. Although to you he was a father \u2013 to the people he was a tyrant. My son had a father once too, and he lost him when younger than you, to Nobuhide's hands. You will not be the only one who sheds tears today, but yours will be the only ones shed in grief.\u201d \u201cIf I untie you, you will not run or attack, but instead sit quietly. Do you agree to this?\u201d she asked, ready to pull out her knife and cut Miyoko's bonds if she was going to behave herself.

It was a feeling that was familiar and soft. The place she had often put her head down and just forgot about her day. Even though this time there was no way she could forget about her day. Miyoko didn't even try to talk back. Her mouth was dry and painful, her jaw starting to hurt slightly from the tension that was placed on it by the gag. She just stared at Jishu, anger and fear still clear in her eyes. The words of the woman made little sense to her. How could she be so cold, how could they just have killed her father like that. She didn't even know what the faith of her mother was yet. She was grief struck in her heart. It had been hard enough for her to lose her older brother, she was sure that she had never fully gotten over that part. And now she was sure that she had just lost her whole family without even being able to say goodbye. She wasn't even sure if they would be properly buried so she could have a place to remember them. She felt like they deserved at least that, though she was sure that Jishu didn't think so. At this moment she didn't even care about her talking about her son. She was sure he had deserved it in some way as she claimed that her father had deserved it. But no matter how angry she felt and how heartbroken she was, she was too tired to fight them any longer. A part of her wished that they had killed her and left her on the same dirty ground that they had likely left her father. She felt as if life itself was too hard to bear. So she nodded, promising not to fight or run. If Jishu kept her word Miyoko would immediately take off the gag from her mouth and started to move her mouth to get her saliva running again and make her mouth less dry. After that, she rubbed her wrists just slightly to get the blood flowing through them again. She wouldn't speak as she didn't know what to say. She just stared at the ground in front of her, not even acknowledging that Jishu was there. It was all she could do from just letting herself fall down on the futon and cry.
