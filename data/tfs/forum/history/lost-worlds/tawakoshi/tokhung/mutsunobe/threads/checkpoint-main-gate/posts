The guards upon the rampart of Mutsonobe\u2019s wall watched the wall of white, even as it swirled around them. The mornings were always quiet in Tokhung, always still, but this morning\u2026.\u2026. This morning seemed to be holding its breath, as if waiting for something. The hairs on the back of the guard\u2019s neck stood on end, and the blue gates of its main entrance did not open. That\u2019s when they heard it from the ghostly corpse that surrounded the capital-- the tattoo of horse hooves over the smooth stone that laid the main path to the gate.Out of the pale shroud came a single rider, slumped over his horse. The men on the ramparts gasped and wondered amongst themselves as they moved to the wall, peering over its edge at the rider. In his back was a spear, and the blue gates opened as the Omaharu guards rushed to bring him in. Within the entrance they pulled the man from his horse, and the captain gripped the material that was wrapped around the end of the spear.An emblem of cranes \u2013 three of them, forever linked in a circle.As the wounded rider died in the arms of the guards, there were more calls, more points to the mists. Something glowed from behind the mist, bright and effervescent, seeming to float in the air. The Captain squinted, and realized what it was before his men did.\u201cCLOSE THE GATES!!\u201d he yelled as the glowing points in the mist became larger, redder, BOLDER\u2014AND FIRE OF HAY AND TAR AND OIL CRASHED INTO THE WALLS OF MUTSONOBE, SPRAYING OVER MEN AND WALLS ALIKE. Screams rattled off as bells and alarms began to ring. The blue gates began to close, but it was too late---- they could hear the DRUMS.[[ MOOD TUNE:  ]]The drums beat a quick tattoo as the feet of a thousand men came surging like wraiths from the mist, their yells a symphony to add to the bells that chimed the warning. Another surge of men behind those who carried ladders to the walls, but they stopped at the mist\u2019s edge, morning dew clinging to their leather-steel-and-lacquer armor as they released their arrows at the men on the walls, claiming as many lives as they could while they still had surprise on their side.The line of archers rotated back into the mist, using it for as long as it lasted as foot soldiers rushed to the wall \u2013 they were fodder in this battle, a distraction at best as more pinpricks of lights in the mist became larger and larger--FIRE RAINED ON MUTSONOBE, catching the paper of screens and walls, the wood of beams, the thatching of rooftops, licking at stone, black smoke rising and causing a panic.How many more waited in the mist surrounding Mutsonobe?A rush of foot soldiers came next, carrying a battering ram between them. They were targeted by Mutsonobe\u2019s archers, but when one man fell, another replaced it. The rotating archers at the edge of the mist seemed to keep coming, and coming, arrows FLYING as if given some supernatural force.Men fell, men bled, fires raced, the large orbs kept CRASHING into the walls and the drums kept playing so every citizen in Mutsonobe would know---- the fall of the Omaharu was at hand.The assaulting army swarmed on Mutsonobe like starlings, clattering up the walls. Ropes were cut, ladders were pushed, destroyed \u2013 arrows were fired from the walls, rocks thrown, oil poured to the screaming and lamentation of the men trying to conquer the fortress, but it all blended together with the terrified screams of the people within Mutsonobe\u2019s walls as well.SLAM! SLAM!The battering ram had made it to the blue gate, and the sun crept higher and higher into the sky, the mist beginning to dissipate. Steam was rolling off from around Mutsonobe\u2019s walls now from the heat of blood clashing with the cold of Tokhung.The misty wall crept backward as the heat of the day took away its power, and more wraiths could be seen, looking as if they were DEMONS come to claim the lives of the Omaharu clan. There was one figure atop a horse, however, one who pushed its steed forward.Wings of a crane crowned the helm, armor of white and blue. Its arm slowly lifted, crossing over the warrior\u2019s body, reaching for the katana sheathed at its hip. The silver horse beneath it was eerily still, and with sudden ferocity, the warrior drew the blade into a high arc and it seemed as if the very MIST surrounding the army was controlled by this gesture, a powerful gale, whipping it away to reveal the forces behind it---- the trebuchet with their fires, the sconces that the archers were now using to fling their arrows over the wall and BURN EVERYTHING\u2026 the lines and lines of men willing to rush forward and replace the men that the Mutsonobe soldiers had thought they were defeating.THE OMAHARU CLAN WOULD FALL.RED STAINED THE ICE AND STONE OF TOKHUNG.THE I R O N\u00a0  C R A N E HAD COME.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><font face=\"georgia\">THE <b>F A L L</b> OF <b>O M A H A R U</b></font><br><font face=\"georgia\" size=\"5\"><i>the</i> <b>R I S E</b> <i>of the</i> <b>I R O N\u00a0 C R A N E<br/>____________________________________</b></font><br/></br></div>"}, "post-74115": {"user": "Miyoko Omaharu", "user_num": 2268, "timestamp": "1508077177000", "message": "When it became clear that the Omaharu Clan was under attack, Miyoko was quickly placed into one of the quarters furthest in the mansion. Her father had shouted at her that she wasn't ready for a real battle, that she wouldn't be for many years and that he would not have another child taken. And so she was stuck in this room, with several servants to tend to her and well-trained samurai stationed outside her door, ordered to wait while everyone else was out there to fight. It was true that Miyoko had never been in a real battle before, but she had been battered and trained to be a samurai since a young age. In the last year especially, ever since her older brother had died, her father had thought of nothing else but her training. Making her train every single day for hours in the dojo. Her arms were full of muscles, her shoulder broader then you would expect and her hair was always drawn back into a ponytail, keeping it out of her way. But it didn't take long before the screams of the dead and dying started to reach their ears. It was clear, they had breached the gates and they were inside, killing anyone who came in their path. The servants started to panic and become unsure of their task. Many had expected to be well protected themselves staying with the daughter of the Daimyo, but now they were beginning to be unsure. It was then, in that panic that she found her chance. One of the windows had been closed and barricaded, but now that there was panic among the servants she had enough time to get out through there. She knew the sounds that were happening, she knew that there was just a small change that any of them would survive if they had breached the gate with the numbers they seemed to have been. She was not going to wait in that musky room till they found her. She would fight, and hopefully she would at least take some of them with her. So she took the wooden beam that barricaded the window out of it with just a quick pull, and before one of the servants could react to her she was out and gone. Into the field, her sword in hand.

And in her eyes, Lord Nobuhide had failed his family, his city, and his duties to his people. In the Iron Crane's eyes, he was not worthy to remain in power, to continue to exhert an influence that did nothing for the people -- except to allow them to wither in the dwindling cold harshness of Tokhung.Her pale blue eyes swept to Miyoko Omaharu as she struggled for a moment against the hand's of the men, then ultimately accepted defeat. She was an Omaharu as well, a family that was a disgrace to the covenant between the Gods and the Daimyo, and the laws that bound them to service to the people. And yet... she was young. Perhaps she could be saved? If so, she needed to begin learning a very harsh, and a very merciless lesson.The Iron Crane began with removing her helm and handing it to a squire that was immediately nearby. He took the white-and-silver armor in his hands with almost a revanance to touch something so legendary, eyes caught on the beautiful masterwork of the crane wings to either side.Her face revealed, the Iron Crane might have once been called beautiful, but now there was a stone coldness to her that seemed to... not necessarily detract from her beauty, but overwhelm it. When one looked upon Sayaka Yukimoto, one did not see the frail and beguiling beauty that claimed most women, but instead the unbending steel of her spine and the penetrating edge of her icy blue gaze. Her snow white hair was drawn up into an immaculate bun, although strands had come loose from the fighting she had done that day.The Iron Crane did not call for a crowd to be drawn. There were many within the courtyard as her lieutenants and captains saw to securing and cleaning and organizing the city they had won -- taking account of the damage that had been done so it could be quickly repaired, bringing in the scholars she had brought on the march to immediately open the books and stores and take accounting of what there was -- and what had been taken.No, there wouldn't be a crowd at Nobuhide's death. She wanted no one to see the way he died, she wanted no one to know where he would be buried, or tossed, or burned. He did not deserve to be remembered, and she wanted no one to watch his death and think it deserved revenge.\"Nobuhide,\" she said to the dazed man. His head continued to lull, so she reached out to grab him by his top knot and force his head up. \"Nobuhide, as new Lord of Mutsonobe and Daimyo of Tokhung, I sentence you to the death of a thief -- for all you have stolen from the gods, and from your people. Your acting lieutenants and your sons will follow you in this death, and you'll daughter will act as witness.\"They were harsh words, that even had some of the men nearby sucking in a breath. The death of a thief was to die by hanging -- humiliating, embarrassing, and a death that perhaps promised Mutsonobe would be haunted by the memory of Nobuhide Omaharu. But in the Iron Crane's eyes, the man did not deserve an honorable death... for he had not lived an honorable life.She let go of his head and looked at her men. \"Hang them from the tree in the courtyard until they are dead. Do not leave them there, but have their bodies stripped of their armor and tossed over the walls with the rest of the dead. Have the girl left in her room, with Jishu.\"The Iron Crane glanced at the nun, and spoke directly to her. \"I will be by after I have seen to my men.\"The woman never again looked in Miyoko's direction as she left to attend more important business than the death of the once-Lord of Mutsonobe.
