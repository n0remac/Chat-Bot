There were a few small, insignificant farming villages around the island; the inhabitants often exported their excess crops to other parts of Tawakoshi and imported practical necessities.  They were a simple, humble folk, but they sustained the Warrior-Nuns with whom they shared Kirishima with.  In return the Nuns protected the villagers from bandits, ronin, and pirates.But the Nuns felt an imbalance in the world.  If the world was a scale, then it was teetering in the wrong direction, or so they believed.  They decided to send Aiko to Tawakoshi's Tokhung province to hunt for a specific yokai.  They hoped that the monster's defeat might reveal some clue about what was wrong.And so when Aiko arrived the previous night she had pinned a notice to a local board.

One little blip and it was out for the both of them. Hiko was intelligent enough to know when to behave and as Haya trusted him, she needed to do little else to restrict him. After a night of sleep Haya felt purified again from the long journey and felt Tokhung's legendary toughness settle just a little bit in her bones as she moved downstairs with renewed optimism. However Hiko's nose caught a scent that was so odd and new to him that even the disciplined inukuma could not help but sticking its snout right up the face of a another inn guest sitting nearby and Haya quickly dragged Hiko back by its collar. \"Oh I'm so sorry, he doesn't normally do that..! I'll buy you a cup of sake!\" she said apologetically and paused. \"Please don't tell the innkeeper...\" she whispered through clenched teeth to the young and slim woman with the soft complexion. Why was Hiko stuffing his snout all into her face like that, Haya wondered.
