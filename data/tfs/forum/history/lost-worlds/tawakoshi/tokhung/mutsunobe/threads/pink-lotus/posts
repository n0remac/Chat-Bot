Even have a little sister, what is not well known is her being exiled for having magical abilities.\" he stood up a started to pace  back and forth \"Sen or even you Shiori with a little outfit change and some history can be passed off as my sister.\" He stopped and held up a ring. \"I have my sister's signt ring, she.. Didn't take the exile well. I held on to it\" his face looked actually a little sad as if his and her exile still hurts a bit.\"As for the Samurai, I am a robin, I could play the part of the despicable mercenary.

She worked together what Sen had told her and put together their goals for the mission.\"I do not believe this Iron Crane would take kindly to a despicable mercenary. You would do well to mind your manners in front of her and act as a noble. As for you, Sen, my face is already known around Mutsunobe as a prostitute, but yours... no one knows who you are. It would be more convincing for you to play the part of the little sister.
