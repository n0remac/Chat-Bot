Geographically speaking, it is the \"lowest\" point in Tokhung, even lower than sea level which makes its weather more mellow and causes something of a \"greenhouse\" effect.Prone to \"small\" floods, most of the houses here and walks are on stilts, and the people here are very used to heavy storms as they tend to naturally gather within the basin. Fujimoto's main export is rice, grain and flowers, with orchards planted in natural groves along the hills.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.pinimg.com/564x/16/c6/cd/16c6cd24747ae7500e0bfcd61152f0b7.jpg"], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.pinimg.com/564x/16/c6/cd/16c6cd24747ae7500e0bfcd61152f0b7.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/><br/></div>"}}
