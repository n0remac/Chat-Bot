Though perilous Zu Fu had made it there unharmed very much because of his skills with magic. Zu Fu wasn't too unhappy about the detour as this led him far away from any Omaharu soldiers and their bad energy. Zu Fu thought that Koruyama was - in some way - like an open wound caused by the strife and darkness that the Omaharu clan spread throughout this already harsh and barren land. It was subtle and to many people it would be impossible to catch onto it, but the spirits, plants, winds and animals told the same story of the unfair rule of clan Omaharu and how they terrorized people here. They were hoping for change very soon. This - however - was not the reason Zu Fu came to this remote place. Change was in the hands of other people, but Zu Fu followed the river or curiosity and personal challenge instead. This place was said to contain strange and shadowy magic and but the feeling of this place surprised even Zu Fu. It was as if even the spirits here were afraid or unable to speak with him. \"This lake...\" he said concerned and looked at the quiet surface knowing the stillness was hiding something. Were there any monks present? If not Zu Fu would go to the lake and slowly sit down. To start with he would observe the eerily quiet water to try to glean something about what was hiding. If nothing happened, he would slowly and carefully dip his fingers inside the waters trying to feel any magic coming from it.

Zu Fu would either have to move quite quickly or get absolutely drenched as whatever lay beneath stirred the water caused a tide that would flush water all over the place. Shortly after large scaled black protrusions appeared to break the surface of the water the head - and eventually body - of the legendary dragon Heilong surfaced as it stood at least a good fifty meters above Zu Fu while huge streams of water poured off it and it looked around a good while before it eyed the small man in front of it. But this was no water dragon, no Heilong was the spirit dragon of spring and melting and soon after an immense heat emanated as it opened its huge jaws - a fiery heat spawned from its mouth, nostrils and huge claws. \"The time... has come, young one.\" Heilong's assertive voice boomed towards Zu Fu. \"I remember you, but you wear another hide and go by another name today, am I not right?\" he asked and laughed as the tremors shook the stone courtyard. \"You may shake the mountain with a thousand giants and my sleep will continue undisturbed, but the touch of one wielding such innate magic would surely wake any dragon - at least those who still have their survival instincts intact!\" he said and bared teeth in a snarl.

One finger was all he needed to know about what hid under the waters.\"Heilong...!\" He said reluctantly. He had an idea about it but was never quite sure that it really was him - the most temperamental of all the spirit guardians. Then all the premonitions were true and this was indeed the time to wake the four spirit dragons. As Heilong rose to a full stand the sight was as terrible and yet grand as one would expect and Zu Fu gave a wry smile while bowing slowly to greet the dragon.\"Good morning Heilong of the North, I am Zu Fu.\" he said with his usual soft voice. \"Hmmm... It must have been a long time since I can hardly remember anything from my last incarnation.\" he said and laughed a bit before slightly narrowing his eyes. \"Then this is true fate isn't it? Neither of us called each other still we stand here face to face.\" he said and nodded his head, seemingly agreeing with himself. \"However I can't say I'm here to harm you, rather my dreams called me out.\" he explained.

Find the other three dragons and wake them up, my guts tells my it's urgent.\" he said and nodded to himself. \"Travel quickly and let the spirits guide your path, I need to return to the water, I fear too much ice have formed since I've left.\" he said and chuckled hoarsely as flames flared up with black smoke enveloping him as he rose even higher putting his feet onto the courtyard crushing the stone with ease. \"We'll keep in touch..!\" he said as suddenly, as a tornado of smoke he rose into the air and down from the mountain towards the vast northern water.
