At other times, Shibao discussed the meanings of what he had learned out in the world with the abbot, meditated in the white nothingness between snow and clouds, and heard about the awakening of the Black Dragon. Neither Shibao nor Xar was suited to the life of a mountain hermit, and after a time, the two decided to leave. Shibao was glad to have Xar wish to accompany him a while on his travels, and once they had loaded up with provisions as well as a supply of healing herbs and some new talismans, they made their way down the long mountain road towards Tokhung's more inhabited regions. \u201cThis land is recovering from war, there will likely be many who may need assistance here. Humans or those of the spirit world. War disturbs all kinds of things best left sleeping.\u201d Once they were in the foothills, and back into gentler walking territory, Shibao \u2013 who had until now left his basket hat tied to his belt - lifted his head and sniffed the air. There was a smell on the wind: of human industry, the inside of the earth, and something else, magical, black and brown. \u201cMaster Xar,\u201d he turned to the werewolf, \u201cdo you smell that? It has the scent of trouble... we should investigate.\u201d Following the scent led them, Shibao with his doglike face now fully covered, down to the vicinity of Ishimura, where they caught sight of a man and woman first stopping at a shrine, then walking on ahead of them along the path.

Xar healed extremely quickly due to the pure blood of the Silver Dusk Pack, as only his father Karga had blood even purer than his. Now fully healed, he saw no difficulty traversing the lands he had traveled already for centuries. He traveled now with Shibao, partly for some company after a long time of solitude, and partly because he still sought an opportunity to repay his debt to the monk, even if Shibao himself saw no need.When Shibao turned to him, Xar nodded in agreement, \"Yes, I smell it too...\" he said, his hand drifting ever closer towards the hilt of his sword as he peered suspiciously down the path that led further into the foothills. As Shibao proceeded, Xar would follow behind him, curious to see what the peculiar scent could be caused by.He spotted the man and woman a bit farther down the road, pausing at a shrine before continuing on.
