Then the scribe brought over a book with a blood red leather cover and an iron-wrought pin of a crane in flight, the detail exquisite. The tip of the Crane's beak seemed to be dark brown, and when the scribe opened the book, it was to a place where the name of a person was written neatly in kanji and a bloody thumb print was next to it.\"Is this information correct?\" the guard asked and handed over the papers Xyrix would now have to carry, making sure that info had been correctly translated. If it had been, the guard gestured and the scribe wrote Xyrix's name neatly beneath a visitor that has passed through before, with the date, then handed him the pin.\"Do you swear you mean no harm to Tokhung, or to it's people, least of all the Iron Crane, savior of the iron lands and Clan Yukimoto who's family has become the blood of Tokhung??\" The scribe asked Xyrix while he held the pin. The only correct answer was yes, and once given Xyrix was directed to prick his thumb and place it next to his name.As this was happening, the guard stamped the paperwork near the top, then folded it half and in half again and sealed it with a wax emblem, and handed it to Xyrix. \"This visa will last you 2 weeks, and the seal should remain in tact until you reach the Daimyo's Offices in Mutsonobe.

Most of those gathered knew little of the people outside of Tokhung, and so the scroll meant little. Still, they recognized the importance and brought out a book to cross-reference the mons on the scroll with what they had in their literature.A conversation happened quietly away from the siblings and closer to the Outpost office, where Xyrix was being attended inside. Glances were thrown Seijo's way, as well as Izanami's, but no action was made until the original guard approached Seijo.\"You will need a temporary visa, which you will have to turn in to Mutsonobe.

In his travels Xyrix learned that it wasn't entirely necessary to slay a beast to get it to relocate. The harsh world around him found it much harder a thing to believe. \"Am I to be under the impression that I should speak with the Kiba family in order to gain access to the mine?\" He'd hate to trespass.\u00a0He held the pin in his hand quietly while he listened, and finally offered a solemn bow from his chair before piercing his thumb. \"It is indeed.

The ghost winced dutifully, although the needle passed harmlessly through her thumb and pierced her ward's instead. Then, subtly, he pressed the thumb he had been clever enough to alternate by crossing to her other shoulder lightly onto the paper in an attempt to make it seem smaller than its opposite.

For long it had been tradition that the member of the Kuzuyama clan and the Inukuma would need to go somewhere far away from where they lived in order to properly connect after a few years together. It was supposed to be a journey of forging trust and deliver fear and anger to the kami who would trade it for tranquility and insight.\u00a0However this journey was on the back of finding that her brother had stolen the Rooster mask, killed the old shogun and been captured by the Hizashi who branded him 'mad', before he was sent back to the Kuzuyama clan on the behest of the Circle. When he arrived back he had been the most guilt ridden person she had ever seen, but also taciturn and unwilling to speak of where the mask had gone - and something told Haya he was trying to protect the clan. Because of the war Haya had postponed this journey but now was definitely the time, she needed clarity badly if she was to deal with this properly.\u00a0\"Honored soldiers of Tokhung, I wish to pass into your lands in a journey of self discovery.\" she said before padding the Inukuma she rode. \"My name is Furusawa Haya, and Hiku here is my companion, which it is tradition that every samurai of our small clan, Kuzuyama, take on.\" she explained awaiting what she hoped to be a expeditious conversation since she and Hiko were tired and in need of finding a place to rest before moving on the next day.\u00a0", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/3062/kuzuyama-clan"], "image_list": [], "html": "Approaching on top of her horse sized "}, "post-91857": {"user": "Clan Yukimoto", "user_num": 2766, "timestamp": "1561852605000", "message": "The soldiers at the gates did not miss Haya, or her wolf-steed.
