He made up for his lack of skill with the obvious - sheer size and strength. He wielded a club with one hand that no human warrior would be able to put to effective use with two, and had a reach with it that allowed him to safely thrash humans with shorter polearms like spears. This gave the ogre a sort of 'I'm bigger and stronger, and that means I'm better' approach to fighting, which almost always resulted in him acting very aggressively.As Kojuro drew his sword, Wuppo pulled his club from its lashing around his waist. The ogre let out a low, throaty growl through gnashed teeth a moment before Kojuro gave the order to attack.

In other words Sanzaemon would join his kami tonight and things would surely turn nasty when all these cowards found their leader dead.

Get on your horse and prepare your spear. We're taking it head on.\" he said leaving no room for discussion.

Still this guy persisted and seemed all too interested in his family origins. Had this been on some sake bar in the outskirts a guy spoke to him like that, Yasuke would have laughed, slapped the guy on the back and offered to buy him a few drinks.

He wasn't cruel, so he would wait until he had finished his business, but would then give the arrogant piece of shirt a trashing so thorough the bastard wouldn't be able to string together sentences consisting of more than a couple of words the next month. But unfortunately this guy was one of the top guys of House Hizashi and had an army to prove it. Swear words were swallowed and it was likely the other samurai's would have to hold him back next time he was sparring in the dojo - but at least he managed to calm himself right now. He had to admit that this guy did not only piss him off him because of his words but also because his character emitted power and the fact he wasn't afraid to use it to bend others to his will. However kindly he asked, what were you supposed to do in this position with an army at his disposal? \"My father was Yoshikuni Daisetsu. I since got rid of that name to make one for my self. The name was synonymous with bad business in the western districts and upon his death I left ten years ago.\" he said. The name was a lie, as was his old man's infamy level. Hopefully this guy wouldn't dig deeper into this business later on. Yasuke was too close to giving away the name of the samurai's father who originally 'donated' him his samurai attire. Yasuke then wiped his forehead thinking how bad that would have been. Yasuke felt like the Hizashi guy was roasting him in the few seconds of silence that went between his question and before he was given an answer - though the answer was no less comfortable. \"Wo-woah...\" Yasuke said surprised as he caught a glance of Hizashi's eyes. Even Yasuke's own fiery temperament became stifled by this glance. What was he telling Yasuke? Was he threatening to kill him if he didn't accept those two beasts as his superiors? Half a horse and an ogre who's club was likely more intelligent than himself? Yasuke had never felt this humiliated before and the fact he was getting away with this scared him.

I am unfamiliar with these... beings.\" he said his voice shaking slightly but trying to sound polite. \"It's unsettling for me and...\" he said and paused clenching his fists tightly to suppress his anger. \"...and the fact that they are my superiors is... an equally new experience. I would have guessed them to be what you'd call 'mercenaries'.\" he said and took a deep breath. \"Please, Hizashi-sama, if you care to elaborate on their origins and names, I would understand better.\" Yasuke said, unable to understand from where he had managed to draw such patience.

I don't know any berries that big haha..!\" he continued with a nervous laugh unable to completely make out what he was trying to ask him.

I have no idea..?\" Yasuke answered as Hizashi asked him what he meant. \"Ohh... I think I said 'mercenaries' and then the... the Wuppo... heard as merchant-berries or something like that.

Ask him? Well perhaps that would work. \"Good Wuppo. You're a good Wuppo!\" he started to ascertain the ogre's aggressiveness almost trying to pat him on the head like you would with a dog, but pulled his hand back in the last moment.

One thing Yasuke might have gleaned from the rambling was that the ogre liked tea, of all things.Wuppo himself was a strange hodgepodge of bits and pieces of human culture, and the strange ideas that he\u2019d apparently cultivated for himself. For instance, the ogre - still covered in the brown of dried blood - cared for military rank and social status about as much as he cared for cleanliness, despite benefitting from it either knowingly or unknowingly. However, at the same time, went through all the trouble to wear his hair in a not-so-correct topknot like the humans, spoke as much of their language as his experience with them would allow, and enjoyed mimicking the daintiness of a simple cup of tea, which he\u2019d in earnest only observed from afar to begin with. Yasuke\u2019s assessment of the ogre\u2019s intelligence may have been accurate, but to give the ogre no credit for as much worldliness as he was able to muster from his life spent largely alone would be to misjudge the giant entirely. That being said, Yasuke would be in fine company with his assumption, as most every single human the ogre had ever met had jumped to the same conclusion; save for one.\u201cWise Otta say Wuppo fight when I\u2019z wan\u2019ta fight, so I\u2019z tell ya.

Yasuke also noticed that from his words this was the only ogre currently under the Hizashi banner but that it wasn't unlikely they would further try to strengthen their ranks with these kind of creatures in the future. This could mean a larger invasion against a neighbouring country was underway. When the time was right he would surely have to ask about the horse woman too and what role she played. If the ogre named Wuppo had said anything specific about his bag, Yasuke didn't hear it.

Now I'm going to make everyone look bad if I hadn't had him to lend me a sword...\" Yasuke muttered with a barely audible voice. These nobles were all the same. Even if they offered you anything, they would only do so to satisfy their petty need for feeling merciful and getting a good laugh. 'Ohh look here, the dimwitted peasant did something stupid! Let's help him a bit to feel good, but laugh in his face for his mistakes because he's in no position to refuse the help!'. Yasuke played that sentence in his thoughts as he resisted the urge to make fitting faces, and in there it seemed to fit perfectly coming from Kojuro's mouth. But every noble or guy with a bit of status was like this in his mind, and this was nothing out of the ordinary. Yasuke glanced at Wuppo again.\"Yeah I'm your man if you want those pumpkins. But we need to travel at night time because... ehrm... pumpkins are much easier to harvest when its dark and cold!\" Yasuke said and nodded knowingly before turning to Kojuro. \"Well... it has to do with their roots, they stick better to the ground when its daytime. Don't ask me why!\" Yasuke explained while doing gestures as he faked a merry smile. He did consider it to be a relatively weak explanation though and quickly conjured another one. \"Yeah and of course I have duties in the daytime, which is of course the main reason!\" Yasuke and exhaled through his lips, trying to make it seem as if it was an easily excusable peasantry blunder on his behalf.
