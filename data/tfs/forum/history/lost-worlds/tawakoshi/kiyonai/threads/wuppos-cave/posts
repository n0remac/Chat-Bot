The box looked like it at some point might have been a reasonably study wooden crate, but since then had been thrown down a mountain and its pieces reassembled by an ogre and a lid added. The lid was held down by a rock sitting on top of the box.\u201cDis Wuppo box! Wuppo keep nice fings for cave in box.\u201d He bent down, and moved the rock that rested on top of the box\u2019s lid. He gave a glance back at Nakatani to ensure she wasn\u2019t peeking into his box of nice things. \u201cDis rock! Box not open wiff rock, an\u2019 Wuppo only one dat move rock!\u201d Wuppo tried to explain his box\u2019s security system as he dug through the contents. Of course, the box wouldn\u2019t open with the rock sitting on it, and Wuppo was the only one that ever moved the rock. As far as Wuppo could tell, this made the box a secure place to keep his cave valuables.After only a few seconds, the ogre would produce a cloth bag, tied on top with a bit of twine. Being sure to replace the rock on his box, he turned back to Nakatani with the bag in his hand. \u201cFrom da Wize Otta!\u201d he announced, showing her the bag in his hand. \u201cWize Otta - him know Wuppo like da tea, an\u2019 gives Wuppo da nice tea. You like da tea? Wuppo make da nice tea.\u201dInstead of asking why Naka was uncomfortable, Wuppo seemed to be rushing to show her how alike they were. He would do this with one of his favorite things; tea.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "If Wuppo had stopped to think about it, which he obviously didn\u2019t, he might have thought to ask Nakatani why she was so uncomfortable and afraid. The ogre was very familiar with the type of guarded behavior Naka was exhibiting, as most people he came in contact with were far from completely at ease around him. It had simply become normal to him over time, and the asking of why didn\u2019t seem to enter Wuppo\u2019s head \u2013 at least not at that moment. What his mind did latch on to, however, was the woven mat he\u2019d made.

By now she had figured out that 'Wize Otta' had to refer to Kojuro, even though she had no clue why this was the case. So when Wuppo mentioned the bag of tea came from Kojuro it brought a smile to her face. She got back on her feet and walked towards Wuppo, somehow feeling more at ease now that the ogre got excited about a little bag of tea. \"Can I smell that?\" she asked gently and if Wuppo would allow it she would take the bag gently and sniff what was inside of it. She knew it. The bag had given it away. This was one of the blends that she had made herself. When she was still just a maid she would spend a lot of her free time experimenting with tea flavors. Looking what kind of things she could put together from the supplies, or what ingredients would add even more flavor to the already existing blend. She had gifted several to Kojuro as he had often been the first one to taste them with her. This one in particulair was a blend of a black tea with orangepeels, jasmine and a little bit of cranberry. \"I would very much like a cup of tea, Wuppo-san.\" she smiled and handed him the bag back.

He held the bag close to his nose just as she had before him, and gave the bag a sniff. \u201cTea good!\u201d he said, turning towards the small shelf that exclusively held an assortment of teapots. Not only would he get to have the special tea he\u2019d saved for a special occasion, he would have a new person to share it with.\u201cWuppo makes da tea! Nice lady get Wuppo most nice pot!

The teapot was a brilliant white (save for a bit of dirt around the bottom), with an intricate blue swirling design on it. This was Wuppo\u2019s nicest pot, and seemed to also be in the best condition when set against the others on the shelf. The top was missing, and there was a hairline crack along the spout where one would pour the tea, but otherwise it appeared to be in good condition given who owned it.Wuppo carried the pot over to the flat rock that was to be a makeshift table, and set it down very carefully. He put the bag of tea next to it. \u201cWuppo careful with pot so nice! I\u2019z take nice pot to wata for wash. Keep pot nice! But top for pot so smoll. Pot so dainty. Top wet! Wuppo drop da top for pot, an\u2019 top break.

A pair of wooden bowls \u2013 which Nakatani might guess would serve as the cups for the tea \u2013 and a few other odds and ends.
