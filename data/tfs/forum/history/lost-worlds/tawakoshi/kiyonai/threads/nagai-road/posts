A monk rises at the same time each morning before the sun, and spends a short time seeing to their personal needs before making the journey to the shrine. For us that meant a rather steep climb, often times carrying water for cleaning hands and other rituals. Once there we chant and pray, offering our thanks for the day and all we have been so graciously provided.After the journey back to the monastery, we have breakfast and normally observe silence until each monk is dismissed for their training, studying, or meditation - as the case may be for each individual. Then later in the day of course there is the evening meal to prepare, the grounds to keep and maintain, and a call to worship before going back to the shrine once more.Sadly this life at the monastery is what ultimately dissuades most monks from pursuing their call to their purpose, as a great deal of the time the monotony of it all wears on them.\u201dSeo\u2019s last statement about the monotony wearing on the monk seemed a bit too knowing for it not to have also been wearing on him as well.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "A smile would come to the monk\u2019s lips as Ketsueki took a moment to construct a delicately worded answer to what seemed like a painfully standard \u2018getting to know you\u2019 type of question.

On the matter of maps, I heartily agree with you. If my travels have taught me anything, it\u2019s that you never know what you\u2019ll stumble across, regardless of what the map might say.\u201d Letting out a slight chuckle, Grandma deftly collected a few more handfuls of berries which she placed in her bag. \u201cI shall see if I can perhaps use these in a drink for us when we rest for the night.\u201d", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Grandma murmured agreement at Zu Fu\u2019s mention of things moving too quickly.

Bad things makes humans want to bring out the best in themselves - although not all heroes do the right thing.\" Zu Fu commented. \"Let's remember that when we're passing into Jeoncho.\" he said and smiled \"Kiyonai is rather fortunate to have had such daimyos ruling it and seeing to its best interests. Life in Tokhung is a hard life under the cruel rule of the Omaharu and now with a new war lord calling herself The Iron Crane. In Jeoncho people have lived in fear of persecution for so long that they don't remember what life without it was like.\" Zu Fu told Grandma. \"But at the same time Jeoncho is the spiritual center of Tawakoshi and its citizen are keenly aware of their relationship to nature. And in Tokhung the place breeds strong warriors that place honor and determination above petty squabbles.\" Zu Fu explaining the two sided stories of each place.\"In Tawakoshi we have many factors that contribute to balancing the lands - and I am only a small wheel in the grand scheme. Many countries, like I suppose Helmfirth or Katashima, were not as fortunate as to develop a balance and are thus currently in a state of chaos.\" Zu Fu explained taking a deep breath. \"Hoping is not enough though, and that is why I am taking this trip.\" he said determined. Zu Fu chuckled a little as Grandma suggested making a drink for them. \"This is why I don't understand the people who are not willing to share!\" his good spirits returning as they set their course towards the border. It would however not be before after a week or so, they would reach the border and this evening they would camp under the night sky. \"I have brought a bit of bread..!\" he said enthusiastically rummaging through his backpack bringing out a varied quantity of apples, mushrooms and vegetables preparing them and putting them all in a pot as he gazed at Grandma. \"Can you make a fire? Because then we're having soup!\" Zu Fu said and went down to the small stream close by the little grove they had found returning back with the pot half way filled with water.

That is a bit surprising to me after hearing how you\u2019ve spoken of it before. If I understand correctly, Jeoncho is the territory most oppressed by the Shogun\u2026 If even in such an unfortunate state they are the \u201cspiritual center\u201d of Tawakoshi I imagine their connection to nature would grow even stronger if they were freed from the Shogun\u2019s rule?\u201d She needed to learn more of the spirits that inhabited this land, they were one of her primary interest after all.

Perhaps my intuition is off on this matter. Regardless, your humbleness is admirable.\u201dThe week of travel passed quickly for Grandma, her time spent either conversing with Zu Fu or studying the landscape around them. It had been but a blink of an eye for her, but yet here they were, already approaching the border.\u201cSurely. Making a fire is the least I can do given you already have the ingredients in hand.\u201dGiven there was no one else near them, Grandma didn\u2019t feel the need to conceal her magic. Of course, there was also a part of her that was curious to see if Zu Fu would have any reaction to such use of magic. She had a feeling he rarely used magic for things as mundane as starting a fire.Turning her attention to a nearby patch of ground only a small distance from the road, one of the rings on her hand began to faintly gleam in the darkness of the night. A handful of twigs and branches lifted themselves from the ground and flew through the air to clatter on top of each other in a surprisingly tidy fashion. Next, as if by an invisible hand, a shallow circular ditch was dug around the sticks. Finally, the twigs and branches began to give off smoke before suddenly bursting into flame.

Zu Fu laughed wholeheartedly as Grandma suggested that he sold himself short. \"Really I don't! My work is superficial at best here! All the spirits aiding the hearts of the humans and guiding the wills of the animal kingdom have laid a foundation so vast I can't even begin to imagine it - and without that I could not accomplish a fraction of what I intend to.\" he said driving himself forwards with the eager of a man half his age. \"Still your wisdom is well attuned because in mortal eyes I would certainly seem important wouldn't I? After all quite vast magic floats through me although it is but a speck of what has been already placed by others and for me to use.\" he added and nodded at Grandma.
