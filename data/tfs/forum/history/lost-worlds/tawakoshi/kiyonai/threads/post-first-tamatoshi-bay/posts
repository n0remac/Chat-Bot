This didn't surprise Rena after the story she had heard from Wuppo. They seemed very superstitious people. When they got closer to the bay, Rena could already tell the difference with the place she was used too. The buildings looked different, the people looked different and the way they clothed themselve did not make sense to her. She wondered if they would find her weird as well..\"Good for ya!

For something better. But, like so many people that left their homes with hope and optimism, had the same problems abroad that they had at home.

From this point, it is left to Josef Zemp   to proceed with the expedition. Josef Zemp and accompanying guard assist with tying the small skiff off at the dock before disembarking. Nearby, the ongoing construction around the ship yard is in full swing. Zemp nods at a passing worker and walks along the small jetty, footfalls thumping satisfactorily. In a perfect world, the smell of salt water and the warm breeze of the ocean would roll through the air. Fish guts, sweat, and sea flotsam The immediate goal was to find a contact of the governmental sort. The chattering throngs of people nearer to the coast had seen the larger frigate coming into the harbor and lined the shoreline. The disembarkation of only three strangers in a small skiff seemed to have disappointed them a bit. The standing orders were for the frigate to remain at anchor out in the harbor. Among the small satchel of belongings Zemp had taken with him from the ship was a messenger dove that he would use to relay missives to the Isran crew as needed. The usual protocol would be for a spell caster to accompany an away expedition and use scrying. Several reasons prohibited this practice, not the least of which was Zemp's allergy to most magical energies. Unlike the highly formal meetings between larger powers, Isran Diplomatic Service protocols employed minuscule use of personnel when dealing with an underdeveloped nation. For today, that meant one agent, Senior Foreign Service Officer Josef Zemp, and one attach\u00e9, Second Apocrisiarius Iulia Iotapa.Zemp was hopeful that someone of import would see and approach the obviously out of place Isran. If that failed, it would hopefully be a simple matter to find a tavern or drinking establishment. In his younger days, it would have been simple to stroll into such a place and charm his way into a free room. Nowadays, the beard and wrinkles tended to get in the way. The elderly and senile man act could help up to a point, but the splendid trousers and shirts of the Isran diplomatic service would scarcely match the masquerade. Instead, Zemp would play to his surroundings, acting the chameleon to the veritable rainbow of this new land around him.The worst part of this entire operation, Zemp had decided back on the ship, was the pittance of intelligence available to Isra. The Empire knew precious little of Tawakoshi. The small scraps held painted a picture of a potential commercial hub filled with a hearty coastal dwelling and militaristic people.A group of children ran past the two Israns, whooping and tittering in their native tongue. The guard accompanying Zemp grimaces slightly as she watches the group weave their way through the crowded dockside. This may be an entirely different world from that of Isra, but the basic fundamentals of blind man's bluff were easily recognizable.\"A damned shame we didn't bring a translator with us, eh, sir? Languages were never my strong suit. I can barely speak our own tongue as it is.\"Zemp looks sideways at his companion and chuffs in amusement, \"Remind me to tell you of the time I stumbled into a barbarian village with nothing but the clothes on my back and a walking stave in my hand. I left that tribe on the verge of worshiping me as their god-king come to walk among them.\"\"And this is relevant how, sir?\"\"Not only is it a good story, but it leads directly to our first moves here. The first protocol of the Foreign Service, as you'll recall: Our rules and regulations ensure we are on equal footing with our contacts. We are two strangers in a strange land. The footing between us and our gracious hosts is surely unequal. It is unsure how this first official overture of Isra to Tawakoshi will be met. To help make it both peaceable and lucrative to both parties is our goal.\"\"I still fail to make this jump that gets you from your original story to the point, sir,\" Iotapa says as she shakes her head.\"You can have a pass on this test, my friend. These lessons will come faster than you like as we delve deeper into our tasks, I will warn you. Am I a god-king?\"\"I do believe that is what you want me to think, sir.\"\"Both cheeky and correct, I see why we were put together for this mission. So many of these new diplomatic appointees are all dour and dull. I acted the role of god-kind among the barbarians because that was the most logical expectation of me. \"The two chat amicably as they finish their stroll along the pier. Finally, they reach the dry land of Tawakoshi and set foot on the tightly packed pathway. Iotapa motions for Zemp to stop by the side of the road. They observe the traffic to and from the docks and begin to hash out their next movements.", "link_list": ["/post/70441/thread", "/user/1310", "/user/2159", "/user/2159"], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/aXQklpl.png"], "html": "<div author=\"@thefreecity2\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/70441/thread\" timestamp=\"1499719041\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-1310\" title=\"The Isran Empire\"><img alt=\"The Isran Empire Avatar\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/aXQklpl.png\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/70441/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1499719041000\" title=\"Jul 10, 2017 12:37:21 GMT -8\">Jul 10, 2017 12:37:21 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-1310 group-0\" href=\"/user/1310\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@thefreecity2\"><span itemprop=\"name\">The Isran Empire</span></a></span> said:</div>A skiff is dropped from the side of the larger Isran vessel, and a party of three climbs down into it.

People normally ask us if their character fits and we'll give them some feedback to make them fit into an environment that is very different than Isra - and will continue to be. The idea of cooperative nature is of course closely linked with the togetherness of asian culture in real life. Things like PvP are really difficult in Tawakoshi because the vast majority of citizen and characters lore wise have never seen magic before, and thus bringing odd magical beings or overpowered mages and dragons are actually directly interfering with the main plots going on in Tawakoshi mainland. We actually don't want to use antimagic if possible. Ritter Adelhard von VessiaYou are welcomed at Sarisu whenever you decide make a post at the port and introduce yourself. In Sarisu the Tawakoshi people are more likely to take in outsiders regardless of their past. It's a trading hub and as explained I'm sure there are things to do for a band of willing knights. I remember having a priest there who could use help against some bandits - I could set you up if you'd like.You did not however leave a very promising impression with the PM you sent me and also by IC indicating you were going to 'just continue' into Kiyonai unscreened if not stopped. It isn't like that, if you post at a check point please wait until we answer you.Tawakoshi is a heavily spiritually influenced and like much religion in Asia they believe that each little thing has their own spirit (They do not however move or take action because of that unless they are being enchanted). The closest thing I've heard about a religion worshipping sentient cotton is the Flying Spaghetti Monster religion. Ittan-MomenIt seems like you really want to go to Sarisu too with those knights and are already well on your way posting there.

Magic is negated in an antimagic field. If you had acted upon this to start with, things would probably have been a bit different.

Still, after traveling to so many other places in the Overworld, Grandma had decided it was about time she made the journey.She had heard it possessed a very unique culture that differed significantly from the other mainland nations, and she was interested in experiencing this culture firsthand. It was a shame she had been forced to leave Tyrell and her sword back in Isra, but the chance of them being noticed in this place was significantly higher than most. Tyrell might have learned something here, but any hint of his presence would no doubt send the locals into a panic, something she had decided was too dangerous to risk.

A few minutes later and a dingy with barely enough room for three people was lowered into the water.
