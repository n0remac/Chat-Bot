He noted that she stood defiantly, if not challengingly. Was he a test for her to deal with? Was she some guard disguised?  \" I see you stranger ; may you find shade and water. I am Tam mhel Farshaw, of the As'deen. \" He said in a warm tone, his voice was deeper than most of the area, and had a slight Goregain (french) flare to it.  \" I would like to brook a kindness. May I buy you tea?\" He asked, starting not at her flesh, but her eyes, then her cheeks, curve of the jaw.  Lust was no where in his eyes, simple awe for all things beautiful. He had not missed the monk, and his expression creased with disappointment. He would have liked to speak with the monk but there would be time still for this, should the all mother will it.  However when the three girls were turned to tam, he offered the same smile and greeting he had the first, including if they wished tea.

Or do we choose ourselves?\" The desert dweller asked, his eyes remaining fixed on hers, save for a quick look about. She smiled at that, she decided she liked this man. He was very different from the normal ones that she got to meet in this establishment, a refreshment in her normal routine. \"You can sit anywhere you would like, Tam mhel Farshaw, of the As'deen. We can even go somewhere more private if that would be to your taste.\" she look him back in the eyes. It was clear her body did not seem to excite him how it did other man, making her even more curious as to why he was here. The dune-walker moved with the grace fitting a dancer. He chose an open seat in the corner of the building. He could see the comings and goings of anyone who entered, as well as other entrances in the room.    Carefully he untied the scarf covering his neck, folded it neatly then placed the spear and buckler-like shield atop it before taking his seat at the table. Though instead of sitting like the green walkers or even like the tawakoshi natives. He squatted with his weight near his toes , his forearms rested on his knees.  It was an odd pose, yet allowed him to move quickly , yet it remained comfortable for those who were use to it. \"  Well met Chen-Hua.\"  While they were walking towards one of the tables, Chen-Hua would signal one of the other girl to bring them a drink. She would whisper in their ear that they requires tea before she went with him. It was a common rule between them that when a man seemed interested, they should not leave there side. So the ones who were free should do the serving. When he started to remove his scarf, she couldn't refrain from giving a small gasp as a small band of scarring was revealed underneath it. However, it was not a gasp from fear, more from surprise at something she did not suspect. She would sit down next to him, though in a more comfortable pose then he had chosen for himself, remaining close to his side. Her eyes would brush over the scarring that covered his necks, soon understanding they were more then just scarring. They seemed like drawings and marks, like a tattoo one might wear. Once again her finger would lightly trace over it, feeling the bumps where the scar tissue was on his skin. \"Would you tell me about your scars?\" she asked him, curiousity known in her voice as she looked him kindly in the eyes. This man was becoming more and more interesting to her with the minute.         Tam froze for a moment as he felt her finger tips run over the Tal'nish on his neck... A warmth spread through his bronzed face , as she asked what they meant. \" You're the first Green walker to ask...\"  he said in a subtle tone. \" They are who I am... Who I have been...\"  He remained still as glass  as she looked at him. \" Should you be able to read them... you would find ever great and terrible thing i've ever done. Traveling to this land , I must make a new Tah'nish for this place. A great honor, even for a banished...\" He said trying not to let shame creep into his voice as he spoke.

Instead Sou promptly turned to the girl with a mean expression and a threatening posture. \"What is the meaning of this!\" Sou said as to intimidate the young woman into spilling the beans quickly. It was a tactic that had usually served him well even against opponents much bigger than himself, but this young woman showed no immediate sign of fear and when she called his name, for a moment his fighting spirit dropped and he felt like his head was spinning. How did she know his name? Sou exhaled loudly and found no other way than to get info from her than to oblige - for now. Either way causing a ruckus inside this place probably wouldn't serve his interests right now. \"Of course I'm distressed!\" Sou said and crossed his arms. \"You seem to know my name, lie about my accomplices and... and I don't even know your name yet!\" Sou said as he had intended to list all her wrongdoings but had to stop short early. He wasn't one with words though he liked to think he was a cut above such proletarians as his accomplices and tried hard to show it people. \"But sure... let me here what you have to say.\" Sou said and appeared unwilling, though he was eager to finally solve this mystery. \"Only thing good of mutual benefit she's done yet is to bring me the damn bottle of sake...\" Sou mumbled to himself thinking there might be enough in there to calm his frustrations for now. Sou jumped a little as she mentioned him being a Hizashi guard and that they considered him to be disloyal. His thoughts were many and among the few was showing her away and making a run for it. If he didn't hear what she had to say, they couldn't blackmail him. But he decided to hear the story to the end anyway, though it was clear to me that these girls had sharper ears than he could have possibly imagined. What came immediately after was by no means pleasant words to Sou, and her eyes seemed to bore into his as he listened to her talking about his friends and how they would have snitched on him. This angered Sou as he could easily imagine them doing just that and even had suspicions at times - most likely because he might have done it himself if he was in their shoes. \"I'm not sure this is good news...\" Sou replied. \"What happens when they are questioned by the Hizashi guys huh? Seeing as they have nothing to lose, my name will come over their lips faster than spit on a beggar!\" Sou said frustrated as he swallowed the last bit of sake in his cup letting her continue her speech. \"You're crafty aren't you?\" he said and returned a harsh glance. \"Maybe I will... Now you've removed my former partners you might fill a gap there. But as I said I'm not sure they haven't snitched on me already, and I would probably be a fool to go back to Hizashi mansion now making it impossible to retrieve any kind of valuable information.\" he said and sighed. \"But you seem sure of this and I can't say it doesn't sound tempting if it can work out. Dealing with those guys were more of a necessity than a pleasure and you've already showed me more cunning than they were able to amount in a life time... I just hope I won't be a pawn in some greater play.\" he said and studied her facial expression. It had softened up and as such Sou allowed himself to do say also. \"Okay, maybe we should talk about what kind of secrets you guys appreciate the most then?\" he said with a wry smile, finding that perhaps his curiosity had already given the young woman in front of him the answer she wanted to hear.

For someone to see him was quite strange. As far as she knew, someone else had to of touched the pick set. She had only allowed Ezia such a privilege, and no one had even tried to reach for the ones secured tightly in her hair. As she walked, she took note of the tea house and paused. Many more people than the usual clientele were gathered, walking in and out of the premises. She poked her head in curiously, eyes growing wide like an ogling young girl excited about the prospect of something new and unfamiliar. In a voice higher than Darius had ever heard it, she leaned over to an older man who was leaned up against the entrance, smoking a pipe, and asked him about the crowd.His brows flew up as he chuckled. \u201cThe owners made a shrine,\u201d he answered. \u201cAt such a place, too!
