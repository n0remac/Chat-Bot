Real magic is in the very spirit of nature and the heart. Read, learn and persist, and you shall see its splendor.\"\u00a0This is one of the core teachings that is carved into the large rocks that lie scattered around the Shrine of Reason and that the Monks of Reason follow and meditate upon. However the natural anti-magical field of The Shrine of Reason has prompted curious monks and scholars to research into anti-magic to harness its powers for the protection of Tawakoshi against large scale magical attacks and their physical effects. Every shogun and leader since it was discovered have generously invested in this method of defense seeing it's use against nations that rely more heavily on magical applications in warfare.\u00a0The House of Reason is therefore arguably the most well protected building in all of Tawakoshi only challenged by perhaps the Reisui Prison in Kiyonai and the shogun's palace in Jeoncho. Also The House of Reason is well within the natural anti-magical barrier that potently blocks out all direct and indirect effects of magic with its vicinity. From within powerful anti magic is being created by monks with the help of holy shrines and stones. The exact method is a secret known only to the very few in the inner circle which includes The Warden of Reason. The effect is called the \"Claw of Reason\", as it stretches out to all major cities and places in Tawakoshi as well as it completely surrounds the borders of the land.\u00a0The antimagic distributed - while harnessed from the powerful natural source - is not all encompassing. It will however completely block out magic use (and it's effects both direct and indirect) on a larger scale in the areas protected by \"The Claw\". Personal use of magic in a fair amount is however still possible without much restriction in these areas, though the shrine itself has such powerful presence of anti magic that all kinds of magic are nullified instantly.\u00a0The following places are without question protected by the Claw of Reason, but others might be too depending on timelines:- The perimeter surrounding Tawakoshi in itself- Places in Kiyonai: Kiyonai City including House Hizashi,\u00a0Reisui Prison,\u00a0Kasen No Tochi Fort, Tamatoshi Bay- Places in Sarisu: Tamisho Port, Sarisu Town (under construction)- Places in Jeoncho: Imperial City Xuandao, Xianhai Temple, Hizashi ambassador mansion Jeoncho-\u00a0Places in Tokhung: Matsunobe, Gangsu Fortress- Places in Quying: Currently noneMany of these places have enhanced magic barrier-stones placed near critical places like checkpoints, palace throne rooms and the likes. Near these focal points one would hardly be able to use magic at all. A secretly trained order of cloaked monks have been trained to guard the House of Reason after the ninja-way. They are proficient with various bladed,\u00a0 and blunt weapons and will dispatch to the shrine itself if needed. The House of Reason protects free thinking, truth and reason above all else and since the new Warden of Reason has taken the lead, they consider themselves largely independent to the various shogun, empresses and daimyo of Tawakoshi that may have their own agendas. Their relationship is mainly one that dictates that if you donate money to the House of Reason in order to support their ideals, they will provide their skill of anti magic protection to the land in question. This is supposedly done to ensure that the House of Reason remains untainted and will not be involved in internal strife and conflict.\u00a0", "link_list": ["https://flic.kr/p/23bX4fQ"], "image_list": ["https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4644/39505313152_f8e3753571_h.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/23bX4fQ\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4644/39505313152_f8e3753571_h.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/></a><br><br/></br></div>"}, "post-77202": {"user": "Ezia Chigusa", "user_num": 2747, "timestamp": "1514584955000", "message": "The young lady strode confidently over the floor as she let her gaze quickly scan the black clad guards who had lined up on each side. \"This is no good! If you can't align properly on a line, then what's the point with all the training you have had?\" she asked wearing a mask of annoyance. But in truth she wasn't annoyed as this was a habit of hers to keep the monks that had sworn to protect the House of Reason on their toes. As Warden of Reason she was at the very top of the order and no one else had the last word whenever she was around. She carried this burden even at her young age and seemed to atvt imes even thrive under it. \"Well you're off the hook this time guys! Go to your posts!\" she said with a smirk as the monks chuckled. She enjoyed a respectful but relaxed interaction with the monks and the hierarchy was flexible enough that anyone could come speak to her if they so desired. She continued into the main library where the holy books, scrolls and tablets were gathered. There were many ways of studying the anti magic that ran through the area around the Shrine of Reason, and even though so much knowledge was gathered here, her preferred way of studying was through meditation alone, though through math she found that the physical world was best understood. But her own preferences did not blind her to what she didn't know, and she prized the scholars that studied the old knowledge and text highly and would seek to learn from them every day. In fact she taught monks and scholars alike that they would never understand their own skill and craft properly if they did listen to the other ways of attaining understanding and learning. Everyone should learn from everyone was her stance on that. \"Have Quying still not come forward whether they want our services or not?\" she asked one of the older monks responsible. \"I know that war and strife is splitting Tawakoshi at the moment, but the idea of being independent is exactly to be able to not pick sides!\" she said as anger quickly rushed through her before calming down again just as swiftly. \"Well please keep me informed. I'm not about to ask them nicely. If they support us, they know we're here.\" she said and crossed her arms. In truth Quying were part of Tawakoshi, and she wished to offer them protection but could not do so without their consent and economical support.

Everything was as grand as she had remembered it. Not one rock was out of place. Typical. She made sure to show up dressed nicely, but distinctly in a startlingly red kimono. It was a staple for the assassin, used when she wanted to be identified by her associates.Her hair had been tied up by several ornaments, two of which were hair sticks, hiding sharp pins within. In her hand, she held a fan held together with iron spokes. Thin strips of wood and some adhesive concealed its true nature. As she strode to the doors, she exchanged stoic glances with the guards. Not one word passed between them, however, they allowed her through without question. When she entered, her eyes swept the room, taking in every detail, searching for something that might be awry.The specter thief followed Shiori wordlessly, their encounter had been---Interesting. The burglar had a suspicion Shori was up to something when she wore that red.What had she called it? A kimnamono? No that wasn\u2019t it\u2026 The man eyed the guards like a kicked dog and edged passed them\u2026 Not that they could see him, but he still hadn\u2019t gotten over his ingrained repugnance to armed guards.

A shudder. When Ezia received the bird, there was little reason to even look at the note attached to its leg to know that it was indeed Shiori who had written. She was old-fashioned in her ninja ways like that, but still, it was a trait she respected. This day had been particularly hard on Ezia with many issues to solve and little time to do it. She had just left the library which was then placed in the innermost chamber of House of Reason and you would have to cross through the main hall, but Ezia\u2019s tired yet determined stride came to a halt when she noticed who had stepped into the hall. Ezia straightened up and placed her hand on her katana\u2019s hilt as she narrowed eyes and gave the young woman an icy glare.

She felt a retort tickle her tongue, but did not seek to satisfy the urge. She was locked in a much more intense battle here.

The sidestep transitioned into an attack in one flowing move with a downwards slash aimed to cut Shiori\u2019s from shoulder to hip.The young assassin raised the fan just in time to bat away the blade, at the same time attempting to move close into Ezia, in the radius where it became awkward to use a katana. Ezia instinctively noticed the intention in Shiori\u2019s move as she blocked her katana. They had trained enough to - most of the time - being able to anticipate the other one\u2019s next move.

Now what exactly the book was he couldn\u2019t say, as he was no mage.    He explained some of the unholy nightmares which he\u2019d faced in the tower, from deathly traps, impossible situations,  horrifying monsters---  \u201c Sorry I\u2019m rambling a bit. Anyhow , I was on death's doorstep from my last encounter when I arrived at where the book was being held\u2026  There was a man there, Named Solis. I had heard of him before, he was apparently one of the earliest people within the tower, before it had become a death trap.   I honestly don\u2019t recall much happened during the forging as it were\u2026 but after I got to speak with some others who were forged.   I ended up being found by another adventure, Kale Everston, and taken out of the Tower.\u201d \u201cAs for who I am? I\u2019ve already said whom I was,  My profession was and am a gentleman thief. Which I suppose got me into this mess in the first place.\u201d He concluded. \u201cSo there\u2019s that.\u201d He said, drumming his fingers on the table softly. Shiori had to fight not to roll her eyes. Where did he even come up with that title? Did he make it himself?His story was incredible, so much so that she struggled to believe it all. She was not as familiar with magic as Ezia was. She did not study it or attempt to recreate it.

I don\u2019t know what to do and I need help making this decision. Do you believe he is a threat to my work?\u201dEzia had her her arms crossed and seemed to be thinking hard about what to do with this guy. \u201cThe story is indeed incredible but not unbelievable. Even in Tawakoshi there are magic that appears baffling and hard to comprehend.\u201d she said to Shiori, who had an expression of almost hopelessness chiseled in her face.

However I would always be cautious.\u201d Ezia advised Shiori. Ezia knew Shiori didn\u2019t keep much company, and that the prospect of having someone around at all times was a confusing one. The assassin looked at Darius.\u201cAnd you. Your words have\u2026 some weight here. What is it that you want?\u201dDarius sighed, \u201c A purpose is always nice, but honestly it doesn\u2019t matter one way or the other to me. Cast me aside if you wish.\u201d He said picking up on the of the picks sitting on the table and twirling it in his fingers. \u201c Though I don\u2019t see how I could hinder Shori\u2019s business by any means.

It will lose it\u2019s magic properties.\u201d she said hoping this would make Darius take notice. \u201cHowever our trials have shown that the item in question is\u2026 not preserved well. And until now we have only tried it with simple magical items like a fire enchanted sword or a ring granting the wielder better physical properties.\u201d Ezia explained in a matter-of-fact voice. \u201cIn other words, if we were to do something like undoing the the forge - which is a complex enchantment - we need to learn more about how the forge was done.\u201d Ezia and looked at Shiori. \u201cThat\u2019s some task.\u201d she said and smirked.
