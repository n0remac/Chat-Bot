The area is known for its cool temperatures though it is not a barren land, and in the spring and summer there's plenty of green. The clansmen of House Kuzuyama are righteous and everyone of them are trained in the art of weapons and armor in order to protect the area from bandits and beasts. The headquarters themselves are only a short ride away from the nearest village and from there on a few other nearby villages follow in short succession.\u00a0\u00a0The headquarters themselves are not to be mistaken with a noble's castle though, and they are more akin to a dojo or military fort - of course with relatively comfortable lodgings for its inhabitants and few servants. The soldiers usually takes care of themselves, growing their own crops and are mostly self sustaining. Visitors are normally welcomed to stay within the headquarters a couple of days and can expect to be asked for news from the other provinces  - and perhaps challenged to a training match or offered to participate in a hunt.\u00a0The Kuzuyama clan - while adept at horse riding - specialize in catching and training the wolf like half-beast dogs that roam the forests further up into the mountain. Some call them dog-bear hybrids, which speaks volumes of the size and ferocity of this canine species called 'Inukuma'. This means that the district protected by the Kuzuyama clan is surprisingly peaceful considering how remote it is. Ironically given their prowess the Kuzuyama clan name commands little authority in the south and has seen only call ups from the daimyo or shogun over the years.Notable clan members:Furusawa Haya ", "link_list": ["https://flic.kr/p/K7g5ax", "https://flic.kr/p/K7g4Yk", "/user/2584"], "image_list": ["https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4757/28294180689_9282a2276c_b.jpg", "https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4697/28294180039_ed287e9d6d_b.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style='font-family:\"font-size:xx-large;'><font size=\"7\">~ Clan Kuzuyama ~\u00a0<br><br/></br></font></span><a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/K7g5ax\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4757/28294180689_9282a2276c_b.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/></a></div>"}}
