Well if things came to that point at least he was going to try. What concerned him the most was still the scary features of his appearance and how it would affect the citizen of Tawakoshi and well... Maybe enough of them could stop him, but if anyone among the upper ones in Kiyonai City heard that he had let this creature through and he had hurt anyone - well he could start working 'inside' the Reisui prison.\u00a0\"I can't let you through\u00a0\u00cdsjakanum-dono... at least not with that appearance.\" The samurai said and scratched his head. \"Okay, wait a moment, we could fix this..!\" he said and strode away while the other samurai wondered what he had in mind.
