Blood. Blood and something else. The scent of magic swirled in the cold air and the clean nothing-smell of antimagic cut through it, slicing into shards. There was something else, the smell of wolf. Instinct made the dog\u2019s hackles rise, but this creature was somewhat beyond acting on instinct alone. Antimagic meant one thing only, the Shogun\u2019s White Hunters. He ran, his paws on the mountain paths sure-footed and fast. A dead hunter here, another further on. This one\u2019s sword was missing. The blood trail led from here. A man \u2013 not a man \u2013 unconscious,  and the smell of magic and wolf were strong upon him, but the white nothing-smell was here too, as was the hunter\u2019s sword \u2013 impaled through the body of the man. Shibao sniffed around the man\u2019s limp body. He stepped around to the man\u2019s face, and pushed at it with his nose, then licked, to try to revive the man. Around the dog\u2019s neck was a cord, and on the back of it was a mask. Shibao used his paws to place the end of the cord, his teeth to pull on it, and once it was loosened, the mask slid around his neck and onto the ground in front of him. Keeping it steady with his front paws, he placed his muzzle into the Jade Mask. Stood in the dog\u2019s place was now a creature neither man nor beast, but now he was tall and strong, he had hands, and he could lift the man, take him to safety. But that sword had run him through quite thoroughly; he was pale and weak. Perhaps another way was best. Instead of taking the man somewhere, he would make this place safe. First to get rid of these hunters\u2019 bodies which would attract scavengers and human attention. From the inside of his kimono Shibao pulled a sheaf of paper amulets, each attached to a small stone. Quickly as he could, He placed them around the area of the combat and the dead Hunters. By stamping on the ground and making several esoteric gestures, the rock that the Hunters\u2019s bodies\u2019 lay on fell away, making the cliff ledge narrower, and assuring the bodies would be broken and buried down below. Then Shibao returned to the wounded man, and using another set of such amulets, he laid them around the area that he lay, and raised walls of rock to create a sturdy tent around the wolf-man-magic-spirit. Shibao sat down cross-legged next to the man, unwinding the scarf from his neck and putting it beneath his head as a pillow. He laid a concerned paw-hand to his forehead. He would need to pull the sword from the body of the man. An antimagic sword -  if he touched it, would it transform him back to his natural form? Shibao made sure to remove the Shrine from his back, so it would stay there if he did change forms, and then putting one paw hand to the man\u2019s back, began to draw the sword back through the wound in the direction it had originally entered.
