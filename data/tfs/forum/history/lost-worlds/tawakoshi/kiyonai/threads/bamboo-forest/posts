Choosing the one furthest to the left will lead you through the bamboo forest - and looking at a map you will potentially save a few hours if you are heading towards Kiyonai. However the narrow path through it is ill suited for merchant wagons or the likes and the bamboo trees stand tall and blocks much of the sun and grows so close to the narrow and winding road that several places two people will have a hard time walking besides each other. Only a short stretch on the start of the trail has a handrail and the stepping stones ends abruptly with the handrails too.\u00a0\u00a0But the place is far from tranquil. People are talking, and even those in a hurry to reach Kiyonai are hesitant to take the road through the bamboo forest. Rumors of blood on the bamboo trees and disappearing people makes the local think that vicious beast, bandits or worse might have laid claim to the forest. Some people make it through unharmed and with nothing to report but a little paranoia - while others just seem to disappear within the maze of the bamboo trees never to be seen again.", "link_list": ["https://flic.kr/p/25B5xzv", "https://flic.kr/p/25B5xzv", "https://www.flickr.com/photos/137813549@N06/"], "image_list": ["https://farm1.staticflickr.com/791/41091083651_ae8fddf1f2_c.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"font-size:xx-large;\"><b><font face=\"trebuchet ms\">The Bamboo Forest\u00a0</font></b></span></div>"}, "post-81041": {"user": "Amai Minami", "user_num": 2807, "timestamp": "1522346950000", "message": "Amai walked through the Bamboo Forest alone, the deep verdant green forest matching with the green kimono she wore.
