The other small and slippery pathway winds up the sides and cliff faces of the mountain, winds and sometimes even blizzards howling through the passes between jagged peaks and threatening to rip careless travelers from their footing on the worst of days. There are no stops along the way, so one must be prepared for the hike and dress warmly on a good day to climb.At the end of the journey, the temple's very rare visitors are rewarded with generous magic vibes. Mana feels extremely powerful here, and within the vicinity of the temple, the whipping, often freezing winds of the northern mountains are neutralized to an idyllic breeze. Visitors cannot help but feel a growing sense of warmth and generosity as they near the temple compound, and within its watchful aura, the threat of cold is completely nullified. Here, the snow feels warm, even comfortable, to touch, and magic wisps of all colors are occasionally seen sparkling through the air.This is the home of those that worship the elusive Wind Singer, and while their hospitality is generous, they live a highly secretive way of life...", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://hdwallpaperdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/shelter-in-snowy-peaks-wallpaper.jpg", "http://therichest.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/japanmain.jpg?auto=format&q=90&lossless=1"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\">It is a treacherous hike to the summit of Mount Tosa in northern Kiyonai, on which the temple rests in a clearing among snowy conifers...

He had received numerous gifts on his travels and his stay at the Temple of The Wind Singer was a fascinating one. Having used his time meditating and unifying himself with nature through the vast mana reserves present, he was also bringing all sorts of magical artifacts, plants and stones he had taken a liking to while staying there. It was things that in some way seemed to contain strong mana and a spiritual connection to Zu Fu. \"Well..! I suppose this will do. Now I just hope that the weather outside is not too bad!\" he said and chuckled to himself. Of course it wasn't because Zu Fu had made sure it wasn't and he couldn't help but laugh spontaneously. Stepping out of the cave he witnessed the blue skies illuminated by the warming sun with a broad smile as he moved forwards through the foot high snow at a considerable pace you wouldn't think a man the age of 102 would be able to keep up. \"Ki-yo-nai! Ki-yo-nai! Ki-yo-nai!\" he chanted while grinning as a sort of mantra where every step was a syllable. Zu Fu would entertain himself like this for a long while until his first resting place.
