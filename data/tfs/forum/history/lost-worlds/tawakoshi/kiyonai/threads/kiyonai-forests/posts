Lighting Xiong's path were those same childlike creatures that clung to him so tightly before- some of which were still clinging to his yukata from the climb. When he passed by they whispered, loud enough to make out the words, though they spoke no language known to the spymaster.He had many other visitors along the way. Elk lifted their heads to stare at the two flouncing through the forest. They, too, were willed to follow, and in a troupe, pranced alongside the young man, keeping his pace as they bellowed. Birds fluttered down from the trees and made circles around Xiong in brilliant plume. Rabbits peaked from their holes and hopped forth, discarding their shyness. A song that had always been there, but had never been quite noticeable\u00a0until now, willed them all forward, the voice of countless spirits lead by an airy soprano that demanded their attention with delicate high notes stringing together to tie them into a dreamy web.However, suddenly, there were no woodland creatures anymore. The path seemed to have taken a very unexpected downward incline, as well.If Xiong had been able to stop himself before sliding down the steep slope that had no foreseeable end, he would hear a bone-shaking crack from above.

He'll find us!\" and \"You shush! You're making all the noise!\" were no secrets to the young man's ears.After a pause, two sets of bright blue eyes peaked out from behind the statue, staring up at the spymaster.
