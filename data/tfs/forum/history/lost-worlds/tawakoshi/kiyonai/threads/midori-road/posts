But cutting vertically, he put a great amount of power while reducing the likelihood of him striking his ally.Ishida's grave misjudgment in distance and timing would surely prove to be a very painful folly. She had moved into the descent of his attack, prematurely, and would be in place well before his attack finished its arc, provided it even had room to maneuver in the close range. Tika's sword had been brushed aside by her opponent's hand--Ishida had presented an effective defense in that regard--but she twisted counter-clockwise into his roundhouse kick, allowing air to escape her clenched teeth as it struck her midsection with a \"tch!\", her left arm grasping tightly for the fabric of the hakama at his raised thigh and entrapping the leg against her now sore and aching chest. The strike had rattled her to the core, but in the adrenaline of life or death, she committed to a sudden, dashing step backwards... She'd consequently jerk to the direction of Ishida's left given her new sidelong orientation, so as to uproot his balance and tear him so violently from his stance that he fell flat on the ground before her... Tika's sword would be whipping full-speed almost lengthwise into the inside of Ishida's exposed inner thigh the instant his left arm buckled from its precarious ward, and from here she had positioned herself aside of Kuro's more cautious advance. It'd take but a release of the leg and she'd be in a stance from where she could see both Kuro and Muramatsu, her weapon trained forward. Should Ishida become hit, fall, stagger, or anything to such an effect, her narrowed azure gaze would stare directly into the space between her remaining opponents.Her normally soft, shy voice now had a very serious undertone, but never did she seem to speak loudly.\"...Just run.
