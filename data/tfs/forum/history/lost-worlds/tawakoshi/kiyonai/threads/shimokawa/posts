Once she was settled his caregivers would also stay back and let the two of them talk. \"Yes, yes, the attack. As it happened we were taken by surprise by the attack. We had heard reports of some happening, but all of those were far away from our peaceful establishment. They entered through the front gates, destroyed most of the market stalls that were out there. Took food and other supplies. Then they decided that it wasn't enough and set fire to a few houses, raped the woman and even some children.

There are 11 heavily injured and about 42 with minor injuries. The damage to the properties I would say is sustainable and easily repaired, but still, add up to a sufficient amount of money.The raid itself seemed to have last about 15-20 minutes.\" he paused again. Izumi wondered what the old men was thinking about. He had to at some point admid to why the attack happened, and why the village was so badly defended. \"I am very sad to say that the attack did not get repelled by our guards. You see, my Lord, all our veteran guards and able young warriors were summoned by your uncle to go to war. I am not blaming him and understand his decision completely, but we were left with undisciplined young boys to do the duty of protecting our city. There have been reports that some of those boys had been spotted among the bandits that raided our town. I wish I could deny their claims, but it seems that all those boys have vanished from the town right before the attacks started. I am afraid they got baited into greed and joined up with them. Our city was left without any protection. Any man who was willing to defend their family has died for it and it took to long for us to mobilize the military. By the time word reached us, the attack had already been finished.\" She sighed. This must be hard for the old men. He had always protected his village and she had never heard of such big damage or deaths coming to anyone here. And because of the decision of others he had now been brought into this situation. When it came for her to talk she would stand up and bow once again, she would take a few steps forward to it would be easier for Kojuro to see her face and so she didn't have to talk quite as hard. She also wanted to make sure the Magistrate would be able to hear her words. \"Of course, my Lord. I was at that very same market to gather some supplies for my family. I like to sometimes go down to that part of the town to speak with the less fortunate among us. Their way of living warms my heart. The raid came unexpected for anyone and their horses were fast. There was no time to react. I don't remember much of how it happened, but at one point a little girl was being chased by one of the men. I..\" she paused, realizing it wasn't very ladylike what she was to admit she had done. \"I threw an orange at one of them, hoping to distract him. It worked, but their attention became focused on me. They decided I would be worth a good ransom and took me along. I believe this to be the only reason that I was the only one taken. Because I looked the part of the daughter of someone wealthy.\"\"They took me their camp, but I am afraid I can't lead you there. I was in a cart unable to see anything. All I know is that the road seemed to be rough, not a general road one would take. And if I had to estimate the time it took us to get there I would say about 20 minutes. The size of the group seemed to be around a total of 50-60 if I had to make a guess. All of them were armed and most were wearing face masks, so I am afraid it would be hard for me to describe them. I was only there for a few hours and nothing was done to me during that time.\" She swallowed, the next part would be the hardest. She would need to talk about how she escaped, but she didn't want anyone to find out that Souma was actually in the hospital of this town right now. \"One of the bandits took mercy on me. He made an excuse to let me use the bathroom behind a tree. He told me that he never became a bandit to hurt anyone and that he wouldn't sit tight waiting for them to do unspeakable things to me. He just wanted to eat, that was all. He cut me loose and told me to run, so that is what I did. I followed a river that he told me to follow and somehow I ended up back in the village. I don't know what happened to him after that.\" The river was probably the biggest clue in the story, a way that might lead them to find them. Izumi hoped it was enough to distract them of Souma. Either that, or that the lordling would take mercy on him for saving her despite the risks for himself. \"I hope that gives you enough information, my Lord.\" she stood up, bowed again and would walk back to her place in the back of the room.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Izumi would follow them inside, staying far in the back as was her place.

I don't intend to waste any time, so it shouldn't be for long.\" The Abbot agreed. \"Is that a satisfactory solution for the time being?\" he asked the magistrate, not believing there was much he could say to object.

Souma would find that a monk came to pray for the sick and injured a lot more than usual within the days that followed. Izumi was also returned to her family. She had been through an ordeal but seemed none the worse for it. Her directions to the bandit camp and description would make getting justice for her and the rest of the townspeople that much easier, and would enable him to plan his attack. If her family wanted any reparations they would have to take it up with the town magistrate. Which left Kojuro with his other witness. He looked over at Akashita, who was still sat on his stool in the middle of the room. \"Akashita-san. You have served the Hizashi faithfully here for many years, and for that I am grateful. But in this matter you have not lived up to what duty requires. You are aware that Lord Hizashi has the right to requisition a number of men from Shimokawa for his armies, yet you failed to train enough men that you would have sufficient guards for the town, once the soldiers had left for war. If the boys left behind were undisciplined, it is only the fault of those who were supposed to discipline them, and that burden lies ultimately with you. This is no longer a time of peace, and changing times call for a change of leaders. Please submit a written resignation along with the name of your chosen successor within the next day.\" \"In the meantime, I would like you to to assemble 40 reliable men or boys from any background to be trained as foot soldiers with sole responsibility for guarding of this town. If you can't find enough menfolk, then hardy women can make up the numbers. Once we have routed these bandits, I will leave some of my samurai here to train them to a standard that should be sufficient to protect the town. I truly thank you for your service, Magistrate Akashita-san,\" he said with a bow that expressed respect for the elder. Now he could retire with his dignity as intact as possible and live out the rest of his old age unburdened by responsibility. Once everything had wrapped up in the town, Kojuro made his way to the Hizashi camp where Wuppo, Rena and the rest of the men waited, with his group of samurai and all the written details of the bandit attack and the location of the camp in the woods.

Staying close enough to camp to hear if there was a returning messenger (just in case Wuppo's brilliant back-up plan had to be employed), the ogre started by walking in circles around the camp. Each lap he made, he would make increasingly bigger and bigger circles, slowly moving out away from the camp.The quest? No one could be sure, but as nearly as anyone could tell, the ogre intended to find the biggest rock he could lift, and squeeze it into his bag. This, by Wuppo's thinking, might fill the bag, and it would have to spit out Rena's cherished flute. It seemed like solid enough logic to the ogre, and he searched for the rock that would solve the problem while visions of returning triumphantly to the camp danced in his mind; the pride of showing 'wise Otta' that he was able to solve the riddle himself. The fact that he'd spent years stuffing people and other things into the bag, all of which had failed to fill it didn't seem to deter Wuppo from his task.Wuppo may have remained undeterred from his task, but was soon distracted. Looking ahead, he saw a clearing through the trees, and approached to inspect the clearing's purpose. Once in the clearing, a quick look around would tell the ogre he had wandered closer to the village than he indented, but saw that there were no humans about. Looking down, Wuppo saw rows of cabbage, wonderfully leafy and green, all planted in nice straight columns. It was only now that Wuppo realized he hadn't eaten in some time. In his dogged determination to find Kojuro, and coming across the ocean to Tawakoshi, he hadn't actually stopped to find anything to eat - and was hungry.The giant bent down, and pulled one of the larger heads of cabbage up out of the dirt with one hand, his hand making the large green orb look more like a grapefruit in his palm than a nice fat head of cabbage. With another look around, Wuppo opened his mouth and chomped a huge chunk of the cabbage, the sound of crunching filling his head as he did so. The cabbage reminded him of the ones the villagers used to bring and leave for him on his mountain before they turned against him - he had been away for some time, and this was the first proper bit of home he'd had since his arrival.Wuppo shoved the remainder of the head of cabbage in his mouth, dirt and all, and began to chew as he bent to obtain more of the delicious treats. The ogre filled his arm, taking no more than seven or so before returning to camp with his bounty. If the person to whom the cabbages belonged saw the ogre taking them, they had made the decision to just let him go with the cabbages.Wuppo made it out of the tree line just in time to see Kojuro and his accompanying samurai come riding back towards the camp on the road. He hadn't completed his task, but he didn't come back empty handed.\"Otta! Wuppo finds da green leafy bits!\" he called, his mouth still full of green crispy cabbage - tiny bits of which were propelled out of his mouth as he got Kojuro's attention with a wave. Wuppo moved over to Kojuro who was still on his horse. He continued chewing the cabbage as he talked, showing his pilfered prize to Kojuro.\"I'z find'ese green leafy bits ova dere!\" he motioned back the way he'd came with the arm that was not busy holding the cabbages. \"They'z good! They'z remind me a'da ones dem brings Wuppo back on me mountain! 'Ere!\"Wuppo looked down, and thoughtfully selected one of the smaller cabbages in his arm. He picked it up, and offered it to Kojuro.\"I sees dish one, an' I says 'Dis small like Otta! Otta like green leafy bit because Otta like small fings!'.

They are armed with a variety of weapons - swords, spears, daggers - but no one mentioned them carrying bows. We should be aware that they may have them, although probably only a small number at most. According to the witnesses, the camp is less than a half hour ride from the village. He unfolded the inked map that Asano had drawn based on the one from the temple, with the locations of the bandit camp and possible ambush sites marked on. Pointing at various parts using a folded fan he showed the assembled group the various features. He tried to keep everything he said simple for the benefit of Wuppo. \"The camp is on a hill in the woods. On the south side runs this river, the Sakekawa. Down here, it joins to the Shimokawa river which runs through the centre of Shimokawa town. The forest to the east of the bandit camp is thicker, to the west, less so. \"My suggestion is this. We approach the camp under cover of darkness. The moon is approaching full in three days time and it seems as though tonight will be clear. Ten of our men, lead by Asano, will approach from the south side of the river and take up a position directly opposite the hill just behind the south bank of the Sakekawa. They will form a line of archers along the bank. The rest of us will approach from the north. We will need to be vigilant as they may have guard posts on approaches to their base.  From the northern group, two small units of five men will pass around the hill to the east, and the west, and be ready to cut down any bandits that flee, or to ascend the hill and give support to the final group. \"That group will be Rena, Wuppo and myself,\" he looked to the two creatures to make sure that both understood their role in the proceedings. \"We will assault the bandit camp from the north, using the element of surprise and fear that Wuppo and Rena will no doubt generate. Our aim will be to cut down any who oppose us, but mainly to drive the bandits down the south side of the hill into Asano's waiting line of archers. They will be cut off by the river and any who attempt to cross will fall under arrow fire. Those who attempt to go east or west will be cut off by the two small groups of mounted samurai. \"Ideally, I want to find the leaders and capture them alive. Wuppo, you can feel free to put them into your bag, since we are going to figure out a way to get them out of it later.\" He smiled at Wuppo, reassuring him that he had not forgotten his friend's request.\"Please speak up if anyone has any changes to suggest, or if there's something I've forgotten to consider,\" he added, thoughtfully, looking around at the group to see if anyone had anything to say.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Kojuro didn't exactly need Wuppo to wave for the ogre to have his attention.

At first wagons full of provisions and equipment arrived, followed by groups of warriors from all over the province. Some in large processions, others in only small family groups, and eventually from Kiyonai city itself Lord Hizashi and his entourage. The town itself had been almost subsumed by a great camp of samurai. Banners of all colours and featuring many different crests flapped in the summer breeze, most prominent among them the sakura crest of the Hizashi clan on the dark pink-red ground whose colour was known as \u201cenjiiro\u201d. Almost all the samurai of Kiyonai were here, save those manning the borders, Kasen no Tochi and defending the Hizashi mansion itself, and of course, those who had gone south with General Kumagai to engage the Shogun's forces there. Kojuro had chosen Shimokawa to assemble the army to march upon Xuandao as the location was out of the way and not especially well known outside of Kiyonai province, while giving them excellent access to the capital from the north and east if they followed along the Shimokawa river through the forest. Zu Fu had assured him that the army would be umolested by the spirits of the forest, and even assisted on their way, so long as they kept to their route and did not go out of their way to antagonise the kami. Kojuro had once again stayed at the temple in Shimokawa along with his personal guard and the small leadership team that would be directing the battle and offering advice. Ryuzo had also come along, although he was not going to join them in taking the war to Xuandao but would instead return to the Hizashi mansion to make sure it was well defended. Due to his size, Wuppo had had to sleep in the temple courtyard, but since he was used to living in a cave in the woods, it probably wasn't too much of an inconvenience. On the morning that they were to move out, he woke early enough that the stars were still visible through the windows of his room, and standing in half-armour, once again unrolled the scroll of their battle plans and looked at the now familiar black ink markings that codified their locations and formations, and what they expected from the enemy, trying to reassure himself that the plans were good, and that he had done all he could to ensure things would go well. He had Nakatani's' hair comb tucked back into his sleeve again, an amulet of good luck that he would return safe and sound. It wasn't his own possible demise that bothered him though, it was these people, all of these people, whose lives were in his hands. He was responsible for all of them, and should he make a mess of this there would be no one to blame but himself. As he assembled in full armour in the front courtyard of the temple with his people, he gave a nod and smile to Yasuke and Wuppo, but his face was white and drawn tight, and he looked far from the relaxed and carefree Kojuro that they usually recognised, despite trying to give the impression of confidence. They made their way out of town, where camp had already been struck in the small hours, and rows and rows of samurai, plus their foot soldiers, and at the back, the many servants and pack animals that kept an army moving. Mounted on a chestnut horse, Kojuro wore a surcoat in the Hizashi clan colours over armour that bore the sakura crest, and the dragonfly design on his helmet caught the early rays of sunlight. In his sash was a flat fan used for signalling, gold with the sakura crest in black. Banners with the Hizashi crest and featuring the phrase \u201cYuuou Maishin\u201d accompanied his party as he rode out. He caught a glimpse of those words and took a deep breath, if there was ever he needed to be reminded of that, it was now. \u201cEveryone,\u201d he addressed the assembled, his voice carrying across the field as he spoke in a tone of command that few had heard from him before. \u201cToday we ride out to take battle to our capital city, and take down the false shogun, who has shown himself both weak in command and disloyal to the Imperial Court. There is corruption at the heart of our country and we go forth now with sword and spear to cut it out. In this, I carry forward the will of my uncle Lord Genji Hizashi, but also  I cannot claim the skill or experience of Lord Genji, but I do carry forward his will, and the will of all people who wish to live in a land where justice is seen to be done and prosperity for all comes fthrough wisdom. With all of your help, I will do my best to ensure our victory. You have pledged the Hizashi clan your lives and they will not be vainly spent. Together we will strike down tyrrany - for the nation, and for the Emperor!\u201d  There was a moment of silence, in which Kojuro half expected yells of dissent or heckling. A shout, accompanied by the drumming of spear points on the ground, roared up from the assembled army in a terrifying unity. \u201cMove out!\u201d Kojuro commanded, raising his fan in the direction of the path they would follow to the capital, and with great discipline the army began to march out along the road that followed the Shimokawa river to the west.

Two arrows crossing each other - seemingly in flight - and he wasn't too displeased with the outcome. Well it was a beautiful and high quality armor and a crest that looked important, but was hard to really put much meaning into it since he was not an archer or did have any symbols he held dear. Pressing Yamazaki hard about the subject he had flung out a 'Well, then go for arrows, since you have Ya in your name..!' followed by a dismissive waving of hands. Still it was his best bet and when he pitched it to the smith he believed he knew someone who could make it for Yasuke. And he had to admit that having a crest was growing on him, feeling almost as important as the other clans around though they probably didn't recognize Yasuke's. However they would and they did take notice every time Yasuke was near Kojuro. He could feel the cogs working overtime trying to figure out how someone they didn't know was standing as personal guard to the lord of the land. This place was absolutely brimming with activity and Yasuke couldn't remember ever having seen so many people gathered together before. Hizashi was of course the most prominent of them all but there were both blue, orange and green crests all over the place - though he didn't see the northern do clan anywhere. Even Wuppo was here and one of the things he would enjoy was to see the enemy soldiers wet themselves when coming face to face with Wuppo in armor. Such a dunce the ogre was, but he had seen how effective he was against the bandits and that was without even a hint of armor. This had to go their way and of course Yasuke had brought a few nasty surprised that might ensure things went their way - well his way - if he found himself in a tight spot. Samurai honor was still bullshit, in the battlefield everyone wanted to win so badly that they didn't give shit about anything - and Yasuke thought himself lucky to have figured this out before everyone else and had prepared accordingly.\u00a0Yasuke nodded back to Kojuro and give his breastplate with his new crest a couple of slaps. He quickly tuned out of Kojuro's monologue though, but the essence seemed to excited the army and he quickly joined in on the cheering. A short moment after they were asked to move out and he grabbed the reins of the horse and rode ahead just behind Kojuro crossing in front of someone else who seemed to want the glory of riding next to the Hizashi lord. \"Oi, get back in line that's a little too close.\" Yasuke said and bore his eyes into the other samurai - who was probably some important figure, but he didn't really care he knew his place.

Two arrows crossing each other - seemingly in flight - and he wasn't too displeased with the outcome. Well it was a beautiful and high quality armor and a crest that looked important, but was hard to really put much meaning into it since he was not an archer or did have any symbols he held dear. Pressing Yamazaki hard about the subject he had flung out a 'Well, then go for arrows, since you have Ya in your name..!' followed by a dismissive waving of hands. Still it was his best bet and when he pitched it to the smith he believed he knew someone who could make it for Yasuke. And he had to admit that having a crest was growing on him, feeling almost as important as the other clans around though they probably didn't recognize Yasuke's. However they would and they did take notice every time Yasuke was near Kojuro. He could feel the cogs working overtime trying to figure out how someone they didn't know was standing as personal guard to the lord of the land.

Wuppo had been in and out of the Hizashi mansion in the weeks and months before the Hizashi clan warriors were to leave for war, and had initially came dressed in his own preparations for fighting. The only problem was that Wuppo wore exactly what one might think an ogre with limited intelligence and even more limited materials would be able to craft. He came wearing a massive iron pot on his head, with a bit of mud holding on several leaves right where a crest might be. On his chest he wore a bit of bark that hung from his neck with homemade rope. On the bark were painted several lines, swoops, circles, and squiggles - none of which came close to being recognizable symbols and all of which intersected and overlapped into a mass of meaningless scribbling. As Wuppo explained;\"Dis say, 'Wupp wiff da green leafy bits. Wuppo BIG! Wuppo ANGRY! GRRR! Wuppo wiff da Wise Otta, him wiff da dragonbug... I'z Wuppo'.\"This only added to the bewilderment of some in attendance. After the events at the bandit camp, stories of a great beast circulated in whispers amongst the Hizashi clan. As sake was poured, the stories became more and more fanciful. An ogre became a beast, a beast became a monster, and before long Wuppo was painted to be a vicious demon dragging the enemies of Hizashi into the abyss itself. Wuppo ready to fight in such silly garb perplexed some of the humans in the mansion. Surely, some thought, this imbecile wearing a pot on his head wasn't the thing these nightmares were made of; the demon had to be somewhere else. More believed that this was proof the stories were wholly untrue; there never was a monster or demon chasing the bandits away for Hizashi. And more still believed that Wuppo was indeed everything the stories told, and had assumed this form to trick their enemies. Of course, none of this was brought up directly to Wuppo.As the time approached, proper armor was made for Wuppo by the clan craftsmen. Real armor made of hard leather plates, and lacquered to a shine, along with a crest of his own. His crest was a pair of radishes, their greenery and bodies forming a circle emblazoned upon his chest. It only made sense, given his affinity for green leafy vegetables. Finally, a new weapon; a tetsubo made from the trunk of a tree, and studded with brutal iron spikes. This new tetsubo was far too heavy for a human warrior, but Wuppo's strength would allow him to wield it as if it were a green maple branch.In the hours before dawn on the day they were to leave, Wuppo was 'helped' into his armor. First the normal servants attempted to help him, but Wuppo was far too large and too apt to move and wiggle to make the job possible for them. In the end, four large men - farm hands under the direction of a page - wrestled Wuppo into the armor. The process tickled, and getting the plates laced up properly and tied to each limb and body part looked more like the men trying to calm several angry boars stuffed into the same large grain sack.As the men assembled, Wuppo did as well. Like Yasuke, Wuppo had never seen so many people gathered in a single place at once. The banners, armor, weapons, and generally the great upheaval of everything around him had the ogre\u2019s head on a swivel constantly. When he wasn\u2019t looking around, Wuppo was touching the crest on his chest. This was all very new to Wuppo, and in his new armor and weapon he looked far more like the monster of the stories that had been circulating in the months before. The people who packed into the small village left Wuppo alone, even if they hadn\u2019t the slightest who he was or why he was there.When Kojuro emerged, Wuppo moved closer to him, and he was already talking when Wuppo found Yasuke. Wuppo tried to listen, and understand. Wuppo had heard Kojuro and the other samurai speaking of duty, honor, and pledges of death. These ideas confused Wuppo, and in fact his lack of motivation by duty, honor, and loyalty to clan Hizashi bothered some. But, Wuppo of course knew loyalty. His loyalty was to one of his only friends. He had set himself a task to protect Kojuro, and of course Yasuke\u2019s presence gave him another reason to be there as well. Perhaps Wuppo didn\u2019t care specifically for clan Hizashi, but there was no denying that the clan\u2019s fate and the fate of Kojuro were inextricably linked, and to that end the clan had itself a steadfast ally in the giant.As the group began to file out of the village, Wuppo seemed quieter than usual. He walked along side Kojuro and Yasuke, his longer legs making him easily able to keep up with the pair mounted on horses. Wuppo was deep in thought. Yasuke might have been tuning out Kojuro, but the words of the \u2018Wise Otta\u2019 had given Wuppo something to contemplate. Yasuke correcting one of the other riders brought Wuppo back to the present.\u201cWise Otta! Tigga Fish!\u201d he said, attempting to get their attention. He reached his arm out to poke Kojuro. \u201cWuppo has da armors! You see da armors?\u201d he announced, beaming and once again touched the crest on his chest. \u201cWuppo wiff da green leafy bits!\u201d", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Wuppo seemed (as per his usual state of being) out of place among the Hizashi.

As part of the guard he would be wearing a banner on his horse with the Hizashi crest though he wore his own on the front of his armour. Kojuro certainly felt glad that both Yasuke and Wuppo would be riding with him. It made him marginally less nervous to have friends by his side as well as the many retainers, vassal clans and allies. There was no way that Kojuro would have asked Wuppo to come along, but the ogre had insisted on doing so, especially after hearing that Kojuro had been hurt. Although his first try at armour had not been too bad considering what he was working with, Kojuro had managed to commission a set from very sceptical craftsmen along with the impressive tetsubo. Glimpsing him be manhandled into it in the early hours, had been a welcome, if brief, release of tension. As well as a crest on the front, Wuppo had a specially made sashimono banner on his back, also in a special overlarge size and bearing the dual radish crest in case anyone was in doubt about the identity of the ogre smashing them over the head.  Kojuro also seemed subdued, lapsing into silence after the speech, as he watched the vanguard file past and take their position at the head of the column, leading the way into the forest. Many of the same people were around him from the last time he had ridden into the woods hereabouts, in search of bandits \u2013 Wuppo of course, Gorobei Morimoto, Makoto Iguchi, Sanzaemon Goda, and although he hadn't known him back then, Yasuke, but there wasn't too much else that was similar. Back then he had been excited to try himself in combat again, and through strategy and superior skill they had won easily. But a pitched battle wasn't the same as a skirmish, and the Shogun's Army weren't a bunch of half-wild ronin and deserters. He was poked out of his reverie by a huge finger that nearly had him sliding out of the saddle with the unintentional force of it. \u201cEh? Oh Wuppo!\u201d he regained his seat and looked over at the ogre, giving him a smile. \u201cIts very manly. I wouldn't mess with you,\u201d he laughed, as he regarded the fearsome appearance of the ogre and his huge tetsubo. Hopefully the armour would keep him somewhat safe, but even Wuppo could be brought down by enough people working together. \u201cYou'll definitely strike fear into their hearts.\u201dThe army marched through the forest with the river to their right, the path through the trees opening up with almost supernatural ease before the vanguard of the party. Occasionally a runner would bring news from the front of the column, and let Kojuro know where they had reached and where was considered the best place to stop for the night. Even with the going made easier by the forest itself, a large party like this did not move fast. They slept in their armour, making do with camp food and occasionally some meat hunted from the forest or fished from the river. Kojuro was careful not to let too much disturbance of quiet woodlands take place under advice from Zu Fu that they be respectful of the spirits. At each shrine no matter how small, somebody would pause to say a prayer and give an offering. On this night, The Shrine of Reason could be seen, its lights glittering through the trees not far to the northwest, as they made camp. No one had come out to meet them as they rode past it to the south \u2013 the House of Reason remaining truly neutral in times of political struggle. Grooms took care of the horses, and Kojuro sat with his command team and personal guards, as fires were lit and men began cooking rice in their helmets. The mood generally was generally somber, until the sound of hooves came thundering up and a messenger dropped to the ground in front of the camp. Kojuro stood, bracing himself for the report. \u201cGeneral Kumagai has engaged the Shogun's forces at Sugimoto Fortress!\u201d he reported breathlessly. \u201cLord Noritoshi surrendered and has been taken captive. The Shogun's army was larger than expected but \u2013 there were no significant casualties on our side.\u201d The Shogun had taken the bait, and Kumagai had defeated the army to the south. Kaen hadn't been killed, and everything had gone according to plan. Better, even. He gave a silent prayer to whatever spirits might be listening. \u201cGood! Get up and eat. You can report in full later.\u201d \u201cWell, looks like that strategy actually worked,\u201d he said returning to the fire. \u201cLooks like there'll be fewer people for you to stick your spear in,\u201d he said to Yasuke, patting on the back as he walked past, and took his seat again, looking relieved and far more relaxed than he had in days.

Once it was noted that Wuppo was the cause of the sudden cry, the people around gradually replaced their pointy bits in their sheaths and sat back down though more than a few eyed the ogre warily. While the Hizashi force was not used to Wuppo\u2019s presence among them it was more than clear that he was a favoured companion of their lord and so they kept any misgivings to themselves. Even the sceptical could tell that Wuppo would be an asset in battle even if he wasn\u2019t dinner party guest material. Kojuro looked in curiosity at the \u201ceat rock\u201d that was dropped into his lap by the ogre. There was a rather tasty smell wafting up from the roasted tuber. He drew the small utility knife out of the side of his tanto and dipped it into the white flesh, tasting a little. \u201cIt\u2019s good, Wuppo,\u201d he grinned, wondering how many rocks Wuppo had tried to roast before he found ones that went soft. \u201cDid you bring these with or find them here?\u201d It made a change from endless days of rice since they had left Shimokawa. \u201cI doubt the Shogun will come out to fight himself, and even if he does, he won\u2019t enter the forest.
