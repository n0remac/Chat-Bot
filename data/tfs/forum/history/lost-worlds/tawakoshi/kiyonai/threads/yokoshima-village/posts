Of course she couldn't be sure if there really wasn't a obvious cause, she had only come to the city last night. \"Do you think I could observe it form a distance at night?\" she said, asking the question as if she was asking the most normal thing in the world.

As Mitsuki would eventually choose to start making her way up the mountain she would at first walk along a relatively narrow path - a path which had some places been overgrown with vines and roots though she could follow the path most of the way. However as she got higher up the visible path would vanish, though she would instead notice several broken branches and steps of what looked like large feet in the undergrowth. If she so chose to follow these steps she would later reach a point where an eerie sound or perhaps even voice was carried through the wind. Deep and dark like the night itself and yet hoarse and rumbling like thunder it was penetrating the air along with a foul odor. Perhaps the spirit already knew her coming and teased her by making its position known? Or maybe the spirit was preparing to launch an attack on the village it supposedly held a grudge against? The possibilities were many even if it was unaware of Mitsuki, she would now be very aware of the direction she would have to take to find the malign spirit.

I will be sure to come back.\" she promised before she too parted ways with her. Mitsuke made sure she went by one of the market stalls before she made her way into the woods and up to the mountain. She bought the reddest apples that she could find, the most beautiful flowers and an old bronze pin she found in the stall of one of the woman. She counted the coins she had left over, making sure she had enough to make that a part of her offering as well. She packed them all in her travel sack and put it on her shoulder. \"No time like the present,\" she said to herself with a sigh and made her way towards where the map pointed her towards. She followed to path closely, picking up a sturdy branch on the way that she used to push the vines out of the way. She followed it all the way until it disappeared and checked her map again for directions, though at this point it confused her more then it helped since the path she thought she was following suddenly disappeared on her. So instead she decided to look around the area and started to notice the patterns on the ground where the twigs had broken away. She followed them again, staying low to the ground and trying to make as little sound as she possibly could. She was sure she wasn't camouflaged very well in her pink silks, but she could at least try to be stealthy. When the smell in the air began to change and she was starting to hear the voice of what she thought was the spirit, she sat down on the ground in the middle of one of its footprints. She began to unpack her travel sack and took out the basket she usually used to collect money for her dances. She placed the apples, flowers, a few different sized coins and the bronze pin she had found into it like a small piece of art. She scooched back about a meter and then took out a thin flute that seemed to be made out of bamboo. She gently placed it horizontally to her lips and put her fingers on the small holes in its base. A beautiful melody started to flow from the flute. Its tones were soft and gentle and carried till deep within the forest. Even Mitsuki herself wasn't sure why she was trying to lure him out. It hadn't been her plan at first, but the longer she had walked and the more she had heard his voice, the more she felt like this was the right thing to do. She just hoped the curiosity of the spirit was bigger than its anger.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Mitsuki couldn't help but smile.

Wuppo was busying himself with something of a meal and some late afternoon entertainment. Sitting next to a nearby stream, Wuppo had a small pile of leaves, wild berries and grass, along with a couple of rocks. The sound Mitsuki heard was Wuppo's voice growling through the trees as he did something that could have been mistaken for singing, but was much closer to yelling.\"Wuppo smack da rock! Wuppo has da tea!\" Wuppo's voice echoed off of the trees, further distorting his gravely scream-sing. He kept a slow rhythm with the rocks, clacking them together in his hands. \"Wuppo smack da rock! A'den.. Wuppo.. Smack da rock more!\" Wuppo improvised a song for himself, and then began chuckling at his lyrical ability.Laying down the rock in his right hand, Wuppo stuffed a fistful of grass, leaves, sticks, and berries into his mouth. It wasn't his favorite meal, and there wasn't much flavor in the foliage he was able to forage for himself, but it was far and away more preferable to eating nothing. Wuppo ate very well when he was in the company of his friend Kojuro (and on a few other occasions), but on a regular basis Wuppo's diet consisted of whatever he could find or hunt for on the mountain and surrounding unpopulated areas. Today had been a rather lean day given his newest project.It was a favorable wind that kept Mitsuki's scent out of Wuppo's nostrils, and his own roaring drowned out her footfalls from his ears. It was only when the soft melody of her bamboo flute came wafting through the trees that the ogre was alerted to the woman\u2019s presence. Wuppo stopped chewing, and looked around. It was not at all the norm for someone from the village to be so far up the mountain, especially not so late in the day. He looked around again, and swallowed the mostly chewed ball of greenery in his mouth. Wuppo got to his feet, and began walking towards the sound.Wuppo approached the source of the sound cautiously, stopping every few meters to look around again. Finally, Wuppo was able to find the source; a woman dressed in bright pink, sitting on the ground where he\u2019d come up the mountain not very long before. He sniffed the air. Wuppo was not in the habit of approaching people if there was no underlying reason for him to do so. Wuppo watched from a short distance away, listening to the sweet and soothing music coming up the slope to him. It was very different from the amelodic howling he\u2019d been doing for himself. Odd, very odd Wuppo thought to himself. And beautiful.Without realizing it, Wuppo\u2019s attraction to the music had pulled him into clear view between the trees. Mitsuki would be able to see the giant, partially covered in mud like he\u2019d been playing in a giant dirt pile in the rain.

This allowed him to use his thumb and forefinger to pull out one of the delicious and perfectly ripe red apples - perfectly shaped.
