In worst case this meant a mob was heading their way soon, so Yasuke took a deep breath and figured he was better off complying with Wuppo. \"Suuure...\" Yasuke said and promptly walked out in the pumpkins' 'line of sight' slightly left-ish of their current position. Perhaps the ogre would see his opportunity to snatch the pumpkins going right - but then Yasuke wasn't convinced he possessed such an intricate understanding of tactics.

He reached out. and with one giant hand plucked the closest of the large pumpkins off of the vine securing it to the ground, and pulled the treat back to him sequestered in his palm.Wuppo sniffed the prize, obviously confident in Yasuke's distraction skills. The lightly earthy smell of the freshly picked pumpkin filled his nostrils, and Wuppo opened his mouth to take a bite of the pumpkin as he lay flat on the ground. He chomped off an ogre-sized mouthful of the pumpkin flesh and seeds, and pondered the taste of the previously foreign treat as he chewed it. Wuppo quickly decided he'd made a good trade with the human, and that telling him how the bag works was well worth the information of where to find the wonderful orange snacks.Wuppo reached out his other hand and plucked free another pumpkin, about to begin gathering them for himself and his pumpkin-hunting partner when he heard a noise. Wuppo's ears perked up, and he raised his head up enough to see the source of the noise - the angry farmer lady. She was wielding a weapon he'd seen the humans use before, but only on the ground. Seeing the farmer shout and charge towards Yasuke (and thus Wuppo himself near him) alarmed Wuppo. He bolted up to his knees and pointed at her, still holding a pumpkin in his hand.\"Pointy bits!\" he shouted in warning to Yasuke through a mouthful of raw pumpkin. \"Pointy!
