Welcome to the Corner Dragon!Please leave any weapons at the entrance and buy your chips at the reception desk!We wish you an enjoyable and prosperous evening!_____________________________________________Okay let's face it, you could do better than the Corner Dragon! Stuffed away discretely\u00a0in a back alley, The Corner Dragon is suffering slightly from the fact that it isn't allowed to be there by the Kiyonai officials. But well distributed bribes handles that, and here you are, so why not buy some chips and place a bet at the gambling table? The rules are very easy to understand - and the game terribly addictive...Inside the Corner Dragon you'll find the reception desk, a table on the floor with the room about a dozen gamblers sitting around it, the beautiful dealer in her red kimono and two dice rollers on each side. The dice rollers are shirtless to avoid being accused of cheating - but they would surely never do such a thing! Please take a seat, we'll find room for you too!So you wanna get going?That's the spirit! Just go to the desk and leave your weapons and buy some chips or put a rare item of value at stake! Looking at the gambling is free, but to play you need to pay the fee.\u00a0If you want to gamble with money, you need to buy chips. Entry into this game costs 1 silver coin. There's a minimum bet at the table of\u00a0 what equals 5 copper coins and a maximum of 100 gold coins. There's a winning ratio of 80% of the gambled amount! So if you bet 10 silver coins, you'll either win 8 and get 18, or lose them all. (Hey, we have to feed our kids, right?)You can also gamble with rare items of yours! Now if you bet a rare item the receptionist will need a good description of it in order to appraise. This betting is what have made The Corner Dragon so popular among adventures and foreigners, as you might win an even more powerful relic/item! And maybe it will be slightly less, but at least you'll get something different! The lost items are lost though - no exception! And won items cannot be gambled with again and cannot be converted into cash! The fee here is only 5 gold coins!The Rules and The Game!The rules are down here because they are made so even the dullest peasant can understand how it works. The game is called Cho-Han Bakuchi, and basically two six sided dices are thrown, and the number that comes out will be either evens (Cho) or odds (Han). As a gambler you'll just need to place your bets and guess the result to win! You'll be rich in no time, mate! Trust me on this!You are free to leave at any time when the dices haven't been thrown, and the receptionist will convert any chips back to regular money - or provide you with tissues if the tears get to prevalent!

This is where he found what he had been looking for, it seemed he had not wasted his money on the guy he learned it from after all. On one of the planks, there was a glass vial with a cork put on the top. Inside of it was a very fine powder that seemed to radiate from an orange color ot a yellow depending on how the light shone on it. To anyone else's eye, it might seem like a worthless pot of dust, but Muffinton knew exactly what is it there. An ingredient he had been after for many weeks now. The ground-up dust made from the wings of a very rare species of moths called the Flitterby. He could only hope that the owners of the establishment were just as foolish to the substance as he hoped they would be. First order of business, fitting in and not raising suspicion on his intentions of being here.

Had it been a regular customer, the Corner Dragon would have been sincerely indifferent about his poor luck, but the foreigners that came to the Corner Dragon had a habit of being high rollers compared to the ragged peasants that normally frequented their establishment. The dealer made quick eye contact with the receptionist and a nod was exchanged as she turned to him.\u00a0\"Isjakanum-san, we would like to make your first visit to the Corner Dragon a positive one. And though we can't just give you anything, we will accept your two last Ryo in a bet where you might win one of our rare artifacts on the shelf over there.\" she said and pointed (see first post). \"I assume that someone like you would be far happier leaving with such a thing than mere gold, am I right?\" she said and smirked.\u00a0Whether or not Isjakanum accepted, the next round had commenced and the dealer was taking in bets from the gamblers, awaiting Isjakanum's decision.1-6\u00b71-6", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"Ahh thank you Isjakanum-san!\" the dealer said and collected all the bets for the next round. As she finished doing that a young boy named Iwaro poked Isjakanum on the shoulder holding up a filled cup of sake.

His luck didn't seem to be good at all, and at this rate he was going to have to trade in another crystal for gold, despite the problems that would arise if he supplied to many of these. He looked up as the dealer began speaking, taking in the words without interruptions and only looking away when the dealer pointed out the artifacts on the shelves, and noted with mild surprise that the crystal he had exchanged was up there. He mused over the suggestion for a bit, and decided that it was best to listen to the suggestion. The chance to gain an exotic treasure was far more rare than the chance to gain gold, and the idea that they would try to sell him short and return the crystal he exchanged was absurd. They surely had some reason in them.\"You are indeed right.\" He responds to the Dealer, placing down the last two ryo in his possession with a muted clink. \u201cI\u2019ll place my bets on odd.\u201d He declares, not willing to change just because of a small streak of bad luck.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\u00cdsjakanum faced the young boy, silently summing him up for a moment.

The dealers would then immediately after lift their cups to reveal the result. 4qSZ4Csb1-6\u00a01-6\"Han!\" the dealer exclaimed as the result at last came up to in the large ice guy's favor. \"You're lucky after all!\" she said as the receptionist went down to Isjakanum with a ball of ice wrapped in a cloth.\u00a0\"I believe this will be a very suitable reward for you, Isjakanum-san.\" the receptionist said and handed him the ball of ice. \"It seems like no matter the amount heat we've tried to apply the ball of ice simply won't melt, definitely some odd magic and the wizard bringing it here wasn't sorry to lose it.
