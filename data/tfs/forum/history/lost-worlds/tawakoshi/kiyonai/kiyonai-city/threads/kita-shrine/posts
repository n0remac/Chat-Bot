Inside the shrine there was space for about two people to say their prayers. Its walls were filled with artifacts, some that must have been quite old, marking the old gods that watched over it. The middle reserved for a beautiful altar where an insence burned, given a sweet smell to the inside of the small building. In front of the altar was a small bed where offers could be brought. \"Isn't it beautiful Kojuro-san?

Approaching the altar, he left the offering of rice wrapped in paper, took some gold coins from inside his sleeve and tossed them into the offerings tray, which currently held only a few copper coins, some green with verdigris. He rang the bell to notify the spirits of their approach, bowed, awkwardly clapped the best he could and prayed to the gods. O-kami-sama, thank you for sparing the life of this servant of yours.

Yasuke had never gotten an answer on the questions he asked Nakatani that day and something about her demeanor had rubbed him the wrong way. She knew more than she told and Yasuke was very interested in what exactly that was. Being the geisha of Genji there was no way she didn't know a secret or two about him and he wouldn't rule out, that she was close to other important people in House Hizashi. He had noticed she would go to the same exact shrine every day at a time where she could be alone there. Well almost alone today. Yao had tied his horse up to a tree a little off the road to the shrine but was able to monitor who was coming and going from there. As soon as Yasuke saw Nakatani on the road in her kimono, he would follow her from a safe distance and observe as she knelt down before the kami - she looked so peaceful, Yasuke thought. He took a deep breath before approaching her from behind. He wasn't proud of kidnapping a frail damsel, but then again you'd had to learn new things every day. \"Think of it as a picninc.\" Yasuke said with a distorted voice as he would grab Nakatani from behind and held his hand in front of her mouth preventing her from making too much noise. Not that it was likely anyone was coming by, but just to be sure. \"You should not struggle, you'll just bruise yourself. And close your eyes.\" Yasuke commanded with a firm voice as he held her tightly and fixated her to the ground while tying her hands and feet and covering her eyes with a piece with a scarf. If she started to scream or yell, he would also make sure to gag her mouth. When she was sufficiently tied up, Yasuke would go to his horse and place her on the back of it. Yasuke knew a place about an hour from the shrine that very few people new of. It was an abandoned shack where they could \"chat\" uninterrupted. Unfortunately the way would be through rough terrain and far flung from the road. Any passenger would surely not enjoy a comfy ride. Being abducted had never been a pleasant thing, but unintentionally Yasuke had tried to hold back on the force he used on her and the tightness of the knots. After all her only sin was knowing too much - which incidentally could be the most unfortunate sin of them all with Yasuke around. \"You gotta endure this a bit.\" Yasuke said calmly as he would start riding towards their destination the horse slowly marching through the uneven wooden floor.

So, in the end, she just kept her mouth shut, her mind twirling in circles, trying to understand what was happening to her. Being flung over the saddle like she was indeed was painful. Every movement of the horse she could feel the saddle pressing against her stomach and she was sure that if the trip took a while, it would easily be bruised up.

At 102 years he wasn't exactly in his youth either, so the thirty or so kilometers he had already walked today had had some influence on his willingness to go further. Even though he'd like to go and pray at this particular shrine. He then sensed it. The presence at this shrine, it was without a doubt a kitsune. \"So..! Are you going to give an old man a hand?\" he addressed the spirit at this shrine jokingly. To Zu Fu - though they tried to hide - most spirits were as obvious as an ogre in a geisha costume. Zu Fu's mana was blindingly present and almost effortlessly he blended his spiritual body with the nature around him only through mere intention. The Kitsune would no doubt feel this immediate - and most likely a long time before he arrived - though nothing in his intention indicated that he was forcing anyone to do anything. Sensing his mana signature it would rather be compassionate and exceedingly light and clear for a human being. \"I'm Zu Fu by the way, and my feet hurt!\" he said his laugh having the same effortlessness as that of the sound of fresh spring water pouring form the ground.

Assuming the kitsune wasn't too shy to tell him her name, he would slowly walk over to the shrine itself and sit down in seiza before it. Zu Fu started to breath deeply and slowly as he moved his hands in circular patterns on either side of his body. With the palms facing straight down into the ground he connected himself to the mana inside the ground continuing the almost wavy movements of his hands. \"This is a good shrine you've chosen and I'm sure you will be able to call it 'home' very soon.\" Zu Fu said indicating that he had knowledge about her arriving here not so long ago. The very soil, plants and trees told him the same story, that a new spirit had taken up residence here but that the energy was still weak around her. Zu Fu got the feeling the spirit was not yet comfortable in this shrine and had a certain distrust for humans. He couldn't gather why, but he was humbled that the troubled and weak spirit had helped him despite this. Taking out his beaded necklace he gathered his hands together in front of him with palms together and placed the necklace between his thumbs and index fingers. Swaying gently back and forth he called for the the remaining energy of the spirit that formerly inhabited this place to be released while asking the lesser spirits of the earth, wind, animals and plants around this place to start supporting the kitsune with their own energy. Zu Fu felt their genuine willingness in doing so. As a flash seemed to go through him he knew he would have to put a lot of his own mana into this place to if it was to sustain spiritual growth from its surroundings. The then took deeper and longer breaths as he merged his mana with that of the shrine. For a kitsune who had taken residence here, it would feel as if energy and power would travel directly into her. This could be an overwhelming feeling for a weak spirit.Zu Fu would then relax and open his eyes again. He wasn't able to restore the power of the kitsune fully. trying to force it would have been dangerous for the magical stability of the place and she already received an amount of power that was far more than she had likely had since before coming here. By removing the remaining energy of the old spirit in the future it should be possible for her to receive more power from the people coming here to pray and it was his hope - now that she had regained much of her power again - that she would wield this power well.Zu Fu would turn to face the kitsune with a warm smile. \"I trust you know that your powers aren't for being a trickster only. The lesser spirits of the animals, plants, soil and wind are helping making this place prosper.\" he said. Zu Fu spoke the words out of wisdom and not to scold the kitsune. \"A shrine isn't a prison though, and duty should never be an excuse for loneliness.

Names were powerful things, but as he had given his own to her, she was willing to give him hers. He was right in his assumption about the shrine. Kazue knew from the traces left here by her predecessor that once this shrine was well known and loved by its people. But as the world became more modern and the faithful fewer, so the shrine had gotten slowly abandoned. Now that even the Miko had left it, she was losing her powers faster than ever before. And exactly for that reason, she was happy that at least someone had come to the temple to pray again. So she didn't disturb him or play his tricks when he sat himself down on the earth. It didn't take long before Kazue started to feel the energy from all over the landscape slowly gather around her. The energy engulfed her spirit and pulled her back to the physical world. For the first time in months, she could feel the breeze on her skin and fur and feel the cold stone ground underneath her feet. From now on she would once again have a choice whether she remained hidden in the spiritual realms which made her invisible to the humans or show herself and even touch the things around her. But it didn't stop there. Energy kept gathering inside of her, at some point she grabbed to her chest, almost feeling as if she would burst from the rapid flow of spiritual energy. In her pain, she looked at the men sitting in prayed, wondering how he could have gathered such a force all by himself. She had never met a human who had such control over powers that even she still had a hard time to understand. It took a long time before she could stand upright again, the flow of energy had come to an end and her body had become accustomed once again to feeling satisfied again.

He\u2019d raised his friend\u2019s hopes of seeing his uncle returned happy and healthy, only to see them dashed again in an instant. It crossed his mind to take up his club and bash the teapot and stone bowl - leaving them both in ruin as retribution for both himself and Kojuro - but, Wuppo thought, destroying was much easier to do than to undo.

Maybe the spirits already had too many teapots.Kojuro beckoned and Wuppo exited a few long moments behind him, loitering for another few seconds.. Just in case. He left the teapot and club where he\u2019d offered them, and met Kojuro outside.

They\u2019d only given some of their produce to a hungry ogre \u2013 and when the worst became real, they were angry.\u201cUnka Gimfee.\u201d Wuppo said. \u201cYou\u2019z tell Wuppo about Unfa? Wuppo not see Unka, but Wuppo like story! Want to know about Unfle Gimchi.\u201d Wuppo glanced sideways at Kojuro for just a moment. \u201cAn\u2019 foods.

The ogre\u2019s mind wandered in reflection of the day\u2019s events as he looked down the cascade of stone steps leading down to the forest path below.
