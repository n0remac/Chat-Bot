Did he still hold a grudge towards Gihei? And could you do that after the bastard was dead? After all that was supposed to have been the definite separation between the two.\"He didn't... Why you're luck...\" Yasuke said and almost yawned expecting Kojuro to tell him something rather meaningless, but when he changed the tone to 'I wish he had' Yasuke stopped his comment short and turned towards Kojuro with a surprised frown listening to the rest he had to say. \"Ahhh... Takahashi-san is scary..! Never spoke with him, but then again who would with the glance he sends you?\" Yasuke joked and chuckled. Takahasi seemed like a bad omen every time he was near and Yasuke had the feeling that Takahashi had never believed him being a samurai for a second but had far too much respect for Kojuro to voice his opinion.  Yasuke rubbed his chin trying to put himself in Kojuro's shoes but it was hard to really picture it with any realism. Wanted to get hit by your father? That was a tough one to imagine.

Also don't get give me that self pity, you're definitely stronger than that and your dad's concern are his own you know...\" Yasuke said before he slid back into the water only his head emerging from the water once again gazing to the sky.
