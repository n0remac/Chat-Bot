Zu Fu glanced out of the window with a sidelong glance. \"I guess you're not one for the small rooms are you?\" he said with a smirk. \"Now, I think we can do just one last little thing before we part ways.

That the users have some amount of alcohol in their body.\" Zu said and moved his hands down to his thighs and straightened his back before closing his eyes.

If Kazue wanted to participate, Zu Fu would lend just a small portion of her power and as she closed her eyes, she would experience an inner image of dark clouds all around her preventing her from seeing much. But slowly the clouds would dissipate and a cool, blue light would shine through until at the very end, all traces of the clouds were gone and the bright image of the moon would fill her inner vision - growing until it was all moonlight and she would open her eyes again. \"What a beautiful moon tonight, wouldn't you say?\" Zu Fu would said with a soft smile, seemingly having observed her - but how much time that had actually passed would be difficult to judge, though no people seemed to have left since they started closing their eyes.

Kazue is a well developed kitsune with six out of nine tails and I have no doubt that before long she will obtain another one. The tails marks how many important deeds they have done in their life and thus their maturity. But Kazue unfortunately still carries a bit of mistrust towards human kind - and you would understand why wouldn't you?\" Zu Fu asked with a smile that concealed how he really felt. \"You think so? Yes indeed the nature here in Tawakoshi should be quite unique. But it is not by mere accident it has become this way. A kitsune like Kazue is an important nature spirit but everything in Tawakoshi contains spirits - they are all around us as we speak right now and because we honor them through offerings, prayers and thoughts, they react by taking care that the wind, water, plants and animals have favorable conditions to thrive in.\" Zu Fu said and smirked. \"But I know that for a thing you cannot see it must sound wondrous if not - a bit hard to understand.\" Zu Fu said, though he thought perhaps this magic user would be able to understand the concept of something that couldn't be seen but still acted upon the world. \"You could say so, but magic in Tawakoshi might be at least as or more prevalent than where you come from. The shogun can outlaw and prosecute those who practice it, but he cannot behead the land itself for being inherently magical. As I told you the spirits of Tawakoshi act upon the land in many unseen and unimaginable ways and even the simplest of peasant might invoke the pity or solidarity of a mighty spirit if his prayers are true.\" Zu Fu explained but nodded reluctantly. \"However I know what you're getting at however this part of Tawakoshi is distinctively less burdened by the shogun's choices and apart form a certain fear of magic users from some people the lord of the land is far more lenient towards magic - and in the areas of Tokhung and Quying it is far more normal to use magic. Jeoncho is the head seat of the shogun and thus - as a magic user - I wouldn't lightly go there.\" he explained enjoying the conversation with this traveler who carried a refreshingly lack of formality and went straight to the point. \"Ahhh a traveler, I see.

Those masks had been one of the main reasons that Tawakoshi didn't have peace and even in his tranquil mind he couldn't help but curse the Jade Queen who had put them into existence and Grandma might notice the further contorting of wrinkles as he frowned. \"Why yes, you would definitely think he does right?\" Zu Fu said secretively. \"For this question I don't know if I can give a real answer but I've outlived a few despots in my time and the shogun seems a little more... sheltered than the rest. I think he genuinely dislikes magic and would probably only use it if he had no other choice. But this is only what I've heard from the spirits as I haven't met the man before - and have no intention to either.\" Zu Fu said. \"How is the rule in your nation? Just? Or do the leader primarily use the power for his or her own means?\" Zu Fu asked back after a brief pause to think. \"Realms? Yes I have seen a few. Some awfully different and I'd have to use days to adjust my perception to what I experienced there while others were so alike I forgot I wasn't here.\" Zu Fu said and smiled followed but a small merry laugh. \"Yes yes! Exactly what I think too! Wonder is what you put into it and when you travel a lot you tend to see the wonder that unfolds just before your nose that much better!\" Zu Fu said and nodded enthusiastically feeling happy to meet another one to share those feelings of his. \"Yes change. The lord is growing impatient in filling the shoes of his mentor and seeks to right all the wrongs the shogun has wrought upon this land. While he won't get that far I think we should be wary in dismissing the pure spirit the young people put into their ambitions for their fire can burn brightly indeed and lay many obstacles to waste. If you ask me if we direct that fire in the hearts of the youth towards goodness and justice that will be how we change this world to the better.\" Zu Fu explained in his own elaborate yet patient way. \"And in the nation of Isra? Do you have such promising youth there too?\" he asked expectantly. \"Now please follow me Grandma-dono, I will show you something though it might be a fresh little walk from here and into the woods. And don't worry, we'll stick to the roads so the gown won't be dirtied!\" he said reassuringly nodding towards the woods on the other side of the pond slowly leading the way with his short and measured steps.

Many of the elders in other nations she had visited, herself included, were far more cynical and jaded. She wondered what exactly he had gone through to achieve such an outlook on life. It was true that she had the memories of some who might possess such an outlook, but possessing the memories of a life and living out a life wasn\u2019t even remotely comparable. Grandma had learned that long ago. Then Zu Fu inquired about Isra. Normally Grandma would paint a picture of perfection and impenetrable strength, which was mostly true, but not wholly so. She wasn\u2019t talking to a politician but to a Wiseman, Zu Fu appeared to be offering her his candid opinions so she decided it was only fair to respond in kind.\u201cThe rule of Isra\u2026 I must admit that I am a biased source, for you see, I am quite close with the leader of our great nation. Empress Naoki, she came to power a few years ago, me at her side offering what help I could. I don\u2019t know if you could call the rule of Isra completely \u2018just\u2019, but compared to most other nations in the Overworld I would say we are fairer in most in our judgments. Naoki certainly uses her power for her own use, but you would be hard pressed to find a leader who doesn\u2019t do this to some degree or the other. This does not mean the people of Isra suffer, in fact, the majority of them flourish. Could all this change if the Empress goals and morals were to change? Yes, but I have faith in the Empress such an event won\u2019t transpire.\u201d Zu Fu now spoke of the youth of Tawkoshi. He described them in quite colorful terms, but Grandma would simply call it a rebellion. Likely for a just cause from the sounds of it, but a rebellion nonetheless. \u201cFrom my point of view, the Empress was a member of the youth and the rebirth of Isra has already taken place. To be completely honest, Isra is such a young nation even from the very start I would say it was inspired by ideas similar to what you mention. But when Naoki came to power, she brought about even more reforms and fresh blood into Isra. I can truthfully say, Isra is a nation that the youth will forge as opposed to nations where the youth is molded to the ideas of their elders.\u201d It seemed Zu Fu had something he wished to show her, and at his mention of not wanting to get her robes dirty, the old woman let out a slight chuckle.\u201cDon\u2019t concern yourself if we take a path that will dirty my robes, I\u2019m quite used to that happening during my travels.

Because then you must tell me how you make that happen!\" he said and laughed again. \"I know about Isra but indeed I know surprisingly little about what it was before she rose to become empress. Maybe you care to enlighten med?\" he asked curious to hear what might have predated such a young - but surprisingly prosperous and large - nation. \"In all accounts one has to be surprised everytime youth shows us what they can accomplice when they really put their heads into it.\" he said and nodded a bit to himself as if reminiscing pieces of his own past.\"Well that's good to know, but luckily it's right on the path!\" he said and flashed another wide grin.
