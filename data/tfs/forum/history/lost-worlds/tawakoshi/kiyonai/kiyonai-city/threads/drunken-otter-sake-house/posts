Not only was he struggling with all his emotions, he also knew deep down that this man was trouble as long as he was in the city. He knew Yasuke and probably wasn't afraid to use any compromising info on Yasuke for his own monetary gains. He had to becareful what he told Gihei - he was a monster and adept at using everything you told him against yourself.\u00a0\"Sto-.. stole them...?\" Yasuke said surprised and fought himself to not just show his father the swords up close and getting it all settled in a nice and bloody mayhem to end it all. Yeah he had indeed stolen them, but when the words came out of Gihei's mouth Yasuke felt disgusted thinking about it. It was not as much the act of stealing them - well... killing some bloke for them - than the fact that he felt like he would resemble Gihei far too much if he admitted it.\u00a0\"These are earned..!\" Yasuke said almost spitting the words out putting his left hand down on the hilt just in case Gihei wanted to try to grab one of them. Actually Yasuke did feel like they had been earned since Kojuro's trust in him had showed, that if they were lost he would make sure Yasuke got a spare couple. \"And the money are none of your business.\" Yasuke added guarded. And neither were his title but Yasuke couldn't resist giving his father a small poke for all that negligence through his upbringing and Gihei giving him shit about not calling him 'father'.\u00a0\"I'm a samurai of House Hizashi now and a quite respected one. What are you doing these days, father? Bought any notable titles yourself with those gambling winnings?\" Yasuke said and smirked like a boy having defied his father for the first time. \"And by the way a peasant like you shouldn't come barging his dirty hands on a samurai's table either..!\" Yasuke said, though his expression was torn between his usual intimidating self and a small boy expecting to get slapped for his insolence.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Yasuke narrowed his eyes when hearing the word 'father' being spoken.

And it's never got you very far.\" Both of them knew, that the times Shisou had tried to lie to his father, he had been caught and punished. Likely this lie must mean a great deal to him if he wasn't prepared to admit it straight away. His eyes went down to the swords as Yasuke put his hand onto the hilt. \"You think that flimsy thing could stand up to my axe? Take your hand away from that pig-sticker \u2026 you and I are just having \u2026 polite words.\" There was absolutely no sense that Gihei wanted to avoid violence for his own sake. Those meaty hands had killed many with his axe in them, or without. The ropes of muscles visible on his arms were a testament to the strength that made him able to kill bare handed. The coldness in his eyes gave a hint that he might not be inclined to hold back even with his son. \"I'm about to make it my business,\" he replied. \"Do those respectable warriors of House Hizashi know just who you are? Just what dung heap you crawled out of? Do they know what you've done?\" He leaned back a little in his seat. \"I'd guess that they don't. Maybe they won't have to, if that purse is anything to go by.\" Gihei wasn't sure what he wanted most - the gold in his hand, or just the reaction of his son. There was plenty of dirt he could dish on Yasuke's past to right people, and both of them knew it. \"A peasant like me doesn't need titles.\" Those who knew him, feared him, and a reputation like that was far better than a piece of paper with some fancy name on it. \"Oh?

Yes Gihei was right that Yasuke had been a bad liar on most occasions and that his dad exposed him almost every time. But the thing about good lies was the fact, that they were never exposed and thus the successful lies were never acknowledged. Yeah, Yasuke had definitely pulled a couple of those on Gihei too - he had simply learned from his bad lies to create better ones. Also Gihei was wrong to assume the lies hadn't brought him anything and the swords and sack of gold were proof of that. Still the way he so convincingly spoke to his fear had Yasuke feel how fickle his position was and how easily this lie could be ended. \"Polite words..?\" Yasuke mumbled and frowned. Indeed normally Yasuke knew his swords would easily take on such a mundane weapon, but with Gihei he was not afraid of the axe - rather it was the man that intimidated him. Yasuke removed his hand from the hilt but kept it in the immediate vicinity as being relaxed with this guy was only an invitation for him to step all over you. And he'd do that willingly both psychologically and physically. Yasuke noticed he still looked like he was tremendously strong and had eyes that radiated with the same malicious intent as they did last time he saw him. Yasuke lowered his head as Gihei spoke about his past in relation to his current samurai status. Yasuke hadn't admitted anything yet, still it seemed like Gihei knew exactly how he had 'worked his way' up, though he couldn't have and it was unsettling how much his father knew about him. Yasuke glanced up at him very shortly and looked down again. \"I don't know how you think I couldn't have done this without lying.\" Yasuke said, determined he wasn't going to give him the pleasure of being right. Yasuke saw how Gihei looked at the purse of gold and glanced back at Gihei. Yasuke then took 10 gold and put it on the table in front of Gihei leaning towards him himself.\"I would have asked you anyway, but this is payment to not lie to me anymore. Tell me, is my mother dead? Did you kill her?\" Yasuke suddenly asked Gihei. The question came from a whim, and was more some kind of 'fight back' to counter Gihei's aggressive questioning, but Yasuke found that he was determined to follow this through. Gihei had told him so many times how his mother had left because he was a horrible child, how she had run away in the middle of the night because she couldn't take Yasuke anymore.

Gihei leaning in close to Yasuke awoke an irrational fear inside him, but Yasuke resisted the strong urge to lean back or cower and instead returned his meanest frown. 'As if anyone was going to let that guy into the mansion' Yasuke thought, though the nagging fear of one easy-to-convince samurai giving him audience at Kojuro was enough to unsettle Yasuke. Well... of course they would torture Yasuke in the cruelest ways if they figured out who he really was, but that was something he had made his peace with a long time ago - and quite frankly Gihei's terror regime when Yasuke was young was far worse than any pain he had yet tried. So the question was... why did he really feel threatened if he didn't fear pain or death? Well, the answer came to Yasuke as a flash. 'Pride'. He was actually proud of his status. For sure he hadn't earned it, but he was very able to keep his position just as well - and even better - than some others to whom the samurai status had been given more 'legitimately'. And Yasuke wasn't about to let go of this pride... the first thing about himself that other people genuinely approved of. No, seeing Gihei again Yasuke realized for the first time that... no, he wasn't scum like his dad. Gihei was scum, Gihei was the one who had planted all those negative feelings inside him. If anyone were to be punished for what Yasuke had done it ought to be... Yasuke suddenly stopped his line of thoughts and raised his voice and called out to Gihei before he reached his own table. \"We do look awfully lot alike.\" Yasuke said as if he was still tasting the words. 'This... This might actually work.' Yasuke thought as all his boiling anger suddenly returned to a calm state.
