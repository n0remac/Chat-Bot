Nostalgia taking over. \"Katashima was.. perfect.\" she looked up at him, a hint of emotion in her eyes. \"It was always sunny, the trees were blooming most of the year and multicolored petals would always be everywhere. Filling the world with such beauty and color. There wasn't one place in Katashima what wasn't in one way or another beautiful.\" she sighed a happy sigh, being glad to remember it. She soon realized though that this information would not help Kojuro at all and tried to take a different approach to it. \"Katashima was ruled by an Empress, she had the power over the entire island. Even though she did her job well, partly because of your uncle's guidance, she was very young to be the empress. Aside from her, the island was cut up into 5 parts. The middle part was under the Empress direct concert and usually the more wealthy would live here. The other four parts had their own leaders, your uncle was one of them. There was the east, the west, the north and the south. All of them having a family that ruled over it under the emperess so she could focus on other things.\" again she took a small break. \"Your uncle was a really good leader.

That is why I immediately made my way here once i heard he had settled in this strange country.\" she suddenly looked up at Kojuro. \"With that, I mean strange for us, from Katashima.\" She quickly added. After that a small silence felt. The talk about Katashima had brought her back to the first time she had worked for Genji. She had sat many times like this, drinking tea with the men she had falling in love with. The men who had chosen honor over her and left her with a broken heart. \"Kojuro-san.. could I ask you a personal question?\" she looked him right in the eye, waiting for him to tell her she could. If he would do so she would ask him the following. \"Say there would be a girl, a woman you truly loved with the bottom of your heart.

Even the life of countries was transient, even nations and empires fell, just like the now blooming sakura. It was an important thing to remember. He took a sip of his tea as she spoke. Her more objective narration of Katashima's political affairs was interesting, although he was of course aware of the basics, but his ears really pricked up when she began talking about Lord Genji, his way with people, his leadership. \"My sister and I would hear bits and pieces of Genji-dono's exploits, though the news was often late, and lacking in details. Both of us rather idolised him. He became quite the legendary figure to us. A hero, as from a story book. Of course, we knew almost nothing about him at all, but I'm glad to hear that he had the same effect on those who knew him best, like you.\" He felt a great sense of pride in his uncle, moreso now that he had heard Nakatani's praise of him. \"It's a great honour to be able to serve him personally. I hope I can learn from his example,\" he smiled.  He didn't seem to take any offence at her accidental calling Kiyonai strange. \"I'm sure it's very different,\" he said, \"but wouldn't it be a boring world if everywhere was the same?\" Nakatani seemed contemplative, and she had given him a lot to think about too. He didn't interrupt her thoughts until she came out with a question. \"A personal \u2026 ?\" he blinked, not expecting something like that, but allowed her to go ahead. They were alone and he had already asked her plenty of questions. The nature of the question surprised him, but there was no hesitation when he answered, \"Honour. Duty to my Lord Genji comes before anything. All samurai will tell you the same thing. But if it was a woman I loved, I hope she would understand that, otherwise she wouldn't understand me at all, and it would be futile to love her.\" After a few moments of thought he continued, \"But, truly, I can only hope that would be my answer.

Kiyonai was a bustling city and everything here was somehow in fast motion all the time in opposition to the peaceful and natural activity in the countryside and forests. Even though the lesser spirits around here governing earth and plants tried to follow the quick pace of the people, they seemed to have difficulty doing so. It was a shame that so few people attended the lovely Kita Shrine because then the people might learn to slow down and - in time - learn to listen to what the air, earth and water had to tell them about themselves and life. For Zu Fu however this pace was kind of thrilling - like running down a hill at full speed not knowing when your legs couldn't keep up anymore and you were going to fall and tumble the rest of the way down. This was what he reckoned most people here felt and he recognized that feeling inside himself. On the way he would go out of his way to greet beggars, merchants and samurai alike with the same friendly smile always. It was usually the beggars who returned the widest smiles though. There was always this feeling about the merchants and samurai that even a smile was something inconvenient - something that disrupted their daily routine of more or less mindless activity. After a while Zu Fu of walking the streets the twilight slowly enveloped the city and he would find a small food stand with room for a handful of people behind the short curtains. \"Good evening good sir.\" Zu Fu said and smiled at the chef behind the counter. \"I'm a traveler and I have little in the means of gold, but I've walked more than thirty kilometers today and I'm feeling quite hungry.\" he said to the guy behind the counter. The guy looked as if he was weighing the truth of Zu Fu's words - but whether it was those or the wrinkles the man nodded and agreed to cook him a bowl of rice and noodles on the house. \"Errhm... I don't mean to sound needy, but I'm very fond of nuts. Do you have a few you could spare I could take with me on the road?\" he asked politely. The guy behind the counter sighed and found a handful he gave Zu Fu with the words that he 'should be very grateful since he wouldn't have gotten free food had their been other guests around'. Zu Fu was grateful, but instead of putting all of them inside his backpack, he put one on the ground behind him and one on the seat besides him. Yes he knew that the kitsune spirit hadn't sated her curiosity yet and that she had followed him to this place in the shape of a squirrel. Of course Kazue probably wouldn't want to eat the nuts even though she was in her squirrel form, but it was a clear invitation nonetheless.", "link_list": ["/user/528"], "image_list": [], "html": "<span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-528 group-0\" href=\"/user/528\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@kazue\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Kazue</span></a></span>"}, "post-78724": {"user": "Kazue", "user_num": 528, "timestamp": "1516737380000", "message": "And Kazue would follow, making sure she stayed hidden from his sight and keeping her energy as low as she could in the hopes he would not notice.

Any lesser spirit she passed she would give a small blessing, sharing just a tiny bit of her spiritual energy with them. It was one of the ways that she kept the balance. Her energy was easily restored through the prayers and gifts of the humans, but hardly anybody prayed for the small ones, so she shared her fortune with them. It felt good to be able to do it once again, now that Zu Fu had somehow restored her back to normal. When Zu Fu stopped at the food stand Kazue watched from a distance, listening to their conversation. Again she was reminded of the selfish nature of the humans, but somehow he managed to persuade the men into being selfless. The very energy around the store owner had changed during the short conversation that they held. As if somehow Zu Fu's presence had inspired him to change his ways, to be more kind towards his fellow humans. Maybe it had to do with the intimidation they secretly felt from Zu Fu's aura without even knowing about it themselves. When he put the nut on the ground behind him, Kazue couldn't help feeling busted. She grumbled at herself and instantly stopped hiding her own energies. She changed her form and walked towards him, though it would become clear very fast that the store owner could not see her. At this moment, she only revealed herself for Zu Fu. So she would reach him, bend over to pick up the nut by just making the very tips of her fingers reach its physical point and when the store owners didn't look she flicked the dirty nut inside of Zu Fu's bowl of soup, smiling at herself with satisfaction. She was still a trickster after all. \"You could have told me you knew I was there.\" She said, though her lips didn't move and the sound of her voice would seem to Zu Fu like it was coming from directly inside of his mind.

The shop keeper would notice the old man talking to nobody and splashing his soup around but seemed to mind his cooking as he slowly shook his head in pity. \"You're probably mad at me for not telling you anything am I right?\" Zu Fu asked the spirit and continued to eat his soup. \"Also I've eaten soup with more dirt in it that this!\" Zu Fu said as if he didn't care, but the shop keeper it seemed as if he was almost about to turn around and give Zu Fu a peace of his mind for criticizing free food when he decided not to anyway.

That is what I mean with selfish.\u201d Her eyes would fume with fury of the thought of those lives she had seen fade away before her. She hadn\u2019t been able to save them.

The various performers, beggars and fortune tellers had their business at the Kiyonai central market where people with more money came. Thus right now the team would see a few people loitering around. It was the usual jobless gamblers, thugs and common folk sharing their daily problems. \"As the bandit said Torakichi would be slightly lower than average height but with a bulky build along with a pair of baggy-kneed leggings, and a short kimono top.

It's so good to s..!\" he said before an elbow hit his stomach and he fell off again. \"I don't know you.\" Yasuke said slightly annoyed. The guy always tried to loan money from Yasuke for gambling and sake because he had lent him a few mon once to shut up and now he wouldn't stop. \"Sake please! Yeah a full bottle, I'm with my ronin friend here who's new in town! Yeah, yeah you won't have to hold my hair this time I promise..!\" Yasuke said with a wry grin as the female bartender jested about last week where Yasuke had had a little too much in a drinking competition against a stranger. Yasuke might have passed out along with the stranger but he wasn't sure the stranger had ever woken up again - he supposed that counted as a win. Perhaps tonight would be slightly less wild when around the lord. \"Ohhh, you're new in town perhaps? What's you name? I promise you won't find the same quality sake other places, mister!\" the bartender said and winked at Kojuro. 'Ohh him? He was just the lord of the land' their eyes would surely widen if they knew who the guy with the scruffy beard really was. People in here didn't even know Yasuke was employed at house Hizashi, they thought him to just be the occasional ronin running odd jobs around town. \"So..! A table right?\" he said to Kojuro with a jolly tone poking him with an elbow interrupting any prolonged talking between him and the bartender before placing the cups and the bottle on the table sitting down at a table near the wall opposite to the bar. \"Kuri-san is fun loving, good looking and can crack a real joke. I wouldn't tell her too much though, those people tend to figure out too much too quickly and she has her eyes on you!\" Yasuke said and took a gulp of the sake.
