Why does literally just walking a block take away all my charges?]However quickly Mordred tried to run he would not dodge all arrows from the samurai as some were fired from his blind spots due to the samurai having surrounded him. This would leave Mordred at least incapacitated and probably incapable of launching his attack which was the aim of the samurai. He had not yet killed anyone, and if possible the samurai would refrain from taking his life. While this happened other samurai with long naginata weapons would block the streets leading away from the market while archers on the ground would take aim for TsaTsa and Mordred and the samurai on the horses would both carefully close in on the wounded Mordred preparing to attack if he tried to resist capture. \"Both of you, halt and give up!\" the samurai would yelled to both of them. \"If you resist further we will not hesitate to end your lives! Hands on the ground!\" they commanded in no uncertain terms. Though the samurai of Kiyonai were not inherently taught in magic, they were taught how to deal with problematic magic users efficiently and would have worked on several team routines they could carry out in these situations. Despite this a few very powerful weapons had been fancied in cooperation with The House of Reason to combat magic users should it be necessary and these were available as a backup should the the two foolishly try to resist further. [TsaTsa wasn't attacked by the samurai in the last post][It is explained here. Please read the part \"Limitations\" thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1364/3-magic-paranormal-powers][Mordred's simple move would not be able to dodge the incoming arrows from multiple locations during a coordinated attack from what is described in your post.
