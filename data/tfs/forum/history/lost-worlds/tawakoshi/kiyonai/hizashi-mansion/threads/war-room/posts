He was relieved that those assembled seemed to accept him sitting in front of them in what would normally be the lord's position.

I believe it would be unwise to let anyone know about Lord Genji's illness as they may take it as a sign of our weakness. \u201cI am not certain of this, but it seems to me that these bandit attacks have been organized. At Shimokawa, the boys who were supposed to be guarding the town were all convinced somehow to join the bandit group and attack their own home. Its a prosperous place, as you know, and it seemed to me that the only thing that could have prompted them to do so would be the chance to gain status. There was nothing else they lacked. When I was attacked on my way back to Kiyonai from the capital, carrying documents to Lord Genji, it seems likely that someone was trying to intercept the Hizashi clan's plans.

The men that have been gathered will be expected to be deployed somewhere, so I suggest we strengthen our borders, with Jeoncho and especially Tokhung. We should also increase the security at the mansion, around Lord Genji. We need to gather information and find out what enemies we may face and from what direction. I also think that it may be a good idea to travel to the capital and renew our oath of fealty to the Shogun.\u201d He knew that Genji had designs on the capital, that he saw the Shogun as a false authority figure that had no claim on the country, and that they would attack Xuandao at some point, but he did not know what those plans were, and couldn\u2019t pretend to be a tactical genius like his uncle. But in any eventuality it couldn\u2019t harm their position, whether it was ultimately sincere or not. \u201cIn the meantime, we have a large foreign ship anchored off the coast at Tamatoshi Bay.

If they get impatient, I can meet with them as well.\u201d Ordinarily the idea of foreign guests and visitors from other lands would be exciting to him, and he would make any excuse to see them himself and ask them questions, but now, he couldn\u2019t help but think of it as rather a nuisance. He hoped some of the others would have something to say, either to add to his plans with suggestions, or else to tell him that they were terrible and propose alternatives. \u201cPlease feel free to speak your minds,\u201d he asked them all, feeling infinitely tired.

We have had visitors here recently and I must admit, I'm curious to see if we could form relationships with the foreigners that would be beneficial to us. Sarisu would be the ideal place to do that. If it didn't work out, at least it would be easily contained to the one island.\u201d He laughed when Genji brought up the wedding, much more as an uncle would to his nephew than a lord to his subordinate. \u201cYou know, Uncle, there's nothing to stop you from moving the date if its too soon.

He observed his father with a serious and formal expression, and once Ryuzo had sat down, he spoke. \u201cChichi-ue. You mentioned that you had returned to serve the clan. I need to ask you a very important question: Are you a Monk of Reason, or a samurai of Clan Hizashi?

Also there was the thing about her kidnapper being apprehended, which meant that she would be no more safe in Xuandao than in Kiyonai City effectively rendering his scheme of having Homura taking her as servant useless. Given Kojuro's distaste for Ryuzo's critique last time it was somewhat a surprise to be summoned to meet him as Ryuzo had half expected Kojuro to try to freeze him out until he left for House of Reason on his own accord. Of course that was be a battle Ryuzo would have won beforehand but still it would have proved tiring to partake in. The setting for the War Room however left Ryuzo wondering what this was all about when there were so many other suitable places to meet and converse around the mansion.\u00a0Ryuzo opened the door and stepped into the war room. It was a familiar sight though it was clear that the years of Genji's rule had actually put it to much more use than under Ryuzo. \"Kojuro my son.\" Ryuzo said and bowed as he looked at Kojuro sitting on the slightly elevated platform and there by positioning himself in a place of power. \"Do you expect me to sit down before my son as some lower ranked samurai?\" Ryuzo said and narrowed his eyes. He didn't like the premise of this talk one bit and it all frankly felt like it was leading up to Kojuro evicting him from the Hizashi mansion. However if this was what Kojuro wished to do he had to oblige and after expressing how displeased he was he reluctantly sat down and listened to what Kojuro had on his mind.After hearing Kojuro out about the first part about him either pledging his sword to Kojuro and accepting him as his lord or leaving for The Shrine of Reason again he sighed deeply. \"Kojuro, I'm disappointed. Is this what you brought me in here to talk to me about?\" Ryuzo answered and frowned. Honestly had Kojuro no respect for his old man asking him to pledge his sword to him? \"I am your father and your former lord and I need not pledge any of those 'services' to you because I did that many years ago - and that was a pledge for life!\" Ryuzo said as the color in his cheeks turned slightly red while ending the syllables of the words more harshly than he would normally. 'If you had learned from my wisdom, knowledge and experience before we wouldn't be having this pointless conversation.' was Ryuzo's first thoughts, but remembered that if indeed he wasn't going to be evicted from the clan he had an agenda being here and didn't want Kojuro to take too much offense. Ryuzo's eyes shortly turned towards the floor and he sat quietly narrowing his eyes ever so slightly. This was highly unfortunate - could Yamazaki really have been going behind Ryuzo's back and telling Kojuro or did he somehow manage to obtain his letter? Ryuzo didn't know for sure, but he would have to find out. However he did feel slightly ashamed, it was underhanded and he knew he shouldn't have done it. \"Kojuro my son, I... apologize. You left me frustrated about the path you had chosen and I felt like I had to take action to correct it. There's a no excuse for it.\" Ryuzo said being prepared to at least admit that it was a foolish thing to do. Ryuzo paused for a moment before nodding ever so slightly. \"I believe - as your father - it is also my place to congratulate you on taking on Nakatani-san as your consort.\" Ryuzo said as he folded his hands rather tensely.

Whether Ryuzo was disappointed or not did not really matter to Kojuro right now. Perhaps he didn\u2019t see the point of this, but depending on how this meeting went, there could be a number of outcomes for the future. Kojuro shook his head once. \u201cI must contradict you there, father.

You returned to this house without them, unarmed. As a monk. \u201cThe service you gave to the Hizashi Clan ended when you gave yourself to the Shrine of Reason. And in any case, you have not yet pledged your service to me, and as your liege lord, I request that of you, now.\u201d There was a hardness in Kojuro\u2019s tone that was not usually present. It was obvious that not only did he mean what he said, but that nothing else would progress until either that request was followed or rejected. He would not share any of his plans for the war with Ryuzo while he remained a neutral party. His interest would be too conflicted. \u201cI realise it isn\u2019t easy,\u201d he continued after a pause, in a more conciliatory tone, \u201cto accept a son as your lord. It is a reversal of the natural order. But this is Lord Genji\u2019s wish, and \u2018duty to one\u2019s lord outweighs duty to one\u2019s father\u2019. I am not being unreasonable to ask this of you.\u201d Yet despite knowing he had to, he did feel somewhat uncomfortable doing it. Although Ryuzo had been somewhat lacking in his leadership of the clan, Genji\u2019s return and takeover could not have been easy for him. At what came next, Kojuro was stunned; momentarily lost for words as Ryuzo offered his apology, and half suspicious that he was doing it to give him a false sense of security before dropping some huge criticism upon him when he was off guard. \u201c\u2026 Thank you,\u201d he replied at last, guardedly.

Regardless, he was missing the point almost completely. And this was merely supposed to be the first formality to get out of the way before continuing with more important matters, yet Ryuzo seemed determined to fight every single point he could. Life would be simpler if he could just tell Ryuzo to leave for the House of Reason right now, but that wouldn\u2019t be the right thing to do, and he knew it. \u201cThat is not what I said, father.

However, I ask you to pledge your sword to the clan, or to decide that your loyalty is to the House of Reason. If the life of neither samurai nor monk appeals to you, you will be free to live out your retirement where you will.\u201d When Ryuzo began to ask him how he would have him serve, as if to negotiate, a flash of anger appeared in Kojuro\u2019s eyes, and the neutral expression he strove to wore hardened. \u201cYour loyalty should be absolute, or it is not loyalty at all. You ask me to suggest positions for you before you decide as though this is a bargain to be struck. We are not merchants haggling over the price of a bolt of cloth. Either pledge your service to me and the clan now, or don\u2019t.\u201d His hand made a cutting motion through the air that emphasised his point. \u201cFather, if you cannot put the needs of the clan in front of your own personal pride, the outcome will be just the same as it was five years ago. I know it was difficult for you to give up the leadership of the clan to Lord Genji, but no one would have thought the less of you had you stepped aside gracefully and served underneath him as his second.  But you could not stand to serve under your older brother, who was the rightful head of the clan, preferring to throw your family aside for your own pride. You left us because you couldn\u2019t bear to compromise.\u201d How would things have been different if Ryuzo had stayed? Kojuro and Anzen had welcomed Lord Genji\u2019s return, but neither of them had wanted to see their father leave. It had cut them both deeply. It had seemed to Kojuro that his father had become more and more distant, a thread stretching between them thinner and thinner, until the day he had left, it broke. What could he have done for Ryuzo to stay? Been a better son, more dutiful, more attentive, cleverer? He had no idea. It seemed impossible to please him and in the end he just stopped trying. \u201cThis is just the same as that. If you decide to leave here, it is because of your own stubbornness.

Ryuzo clenched his fists as he listened to Kojuro speak about the incident with Genji. It was true it had been difficult for Ryuzo, nobody seemed to understand his pride for this clan and how much he had done for it. \"It is NOT because I couldn't stand to work under Genji!\" Ryuzo suddenly exclaimed and hit the palm of his hand into his leg. \"There was nothing I could have done more gracefully than leaving the clan! Genji, Genji, Genji! Everyone loved Genji and wanted him to take the position back after fifteen years of having been absent!\" Ryuzo said upset. \"Genji is totally different from me, he is a warlord and I'm an academic. I left because I love the clan. I left because I didn't want strife to tear it apart. But I also left because I wanted you to see to see that even Genji..!\" Ryuzo said as he almost popped a vain and his cheeks became purple before sighing and restraining himself again. \"... Never mind, it's not kind to speak of the ill. But Genji practically left me no choice. I could have stayed and lived like a ghost by his side but instead I traveled with the winds until the storm settled. I knew that you and Anzen had already made your choice, and though it pained me I knew that you had to stay to learn clan matters. Even though me and Genji had differences, I knew he would be a teacher and an inspiration to you, Kojuro.\" Ryuzo said and sighed. \"Maybe I envy him slightly. He seems to have a better grasp on you than I ever had. It's hard to see your brother take both your clan and your son's love.\" Ryuzo said and silently took a deep breath. After a small pause Ryuzo spoke again. \"I am a bird and not a fish or a worm. Clan Hizashi is my home and pledging my allegiance would be a trifle matter because I already did so when I was born and I cannot escape that fate - and neither do I wish to.\" he said and looked Kojuro straight into his eyes. \"I will pledge my sword with you and the clan if that is what you ask me to. But! It will also be a promise that I'll stay for good, so it comes down to this one question: What will you do if Genji, as we all hope, regains his good health? Who will be the lord then?\" Ryuzo asked.

Although he felt Ryuzo's commentary often came after the fact and could therefore be better described as criticism than advice, the rest of the points he made were valid. He knew that he had made a lot of mistakes and bad decisions, he had no wish to compound them even further when so much was at stake. But on this occasion, he truly felt that he was on the right track. To follow Genji's wishes, but to do so in a way that made sense to him.

Of course you carry Hizashi blood, but you seem to forget that you turned your back on that for your studies at the resolutely neutral House of Reason. However noble that intent, however useful the work you were doing, it still remains that you put that before your house and clan, and I need you to set it aside.\u201d Even though Kojuro himself was angry it seemed to be nothing compared to Ryuzo's explosion of rage and he found himself becoming rather embarrassed to see such a display of raw emotion coming from his father. His face went white, although he stayed completely still and his expression was still set hard as though any tiny movement would break it entirely. At first all he heard was jealous rage as hs railed against Genji taking his place as head of the clan, and then his fists clenched slightly as Ryuzo dared to insult Genji, but then a calmness seemed to settle over Ryuzo and Kojuro tried to get his mind twisted in the direction Ryuzo was coming from. Once the storm had died down, Kojuro spoke again. \u201cFather, we needed Genji,\u201d he said quietly, almost gently, \u201cThe clan had fallen into stagnation. And worse, we were dying. The Hizashi became nothing but a hollow shell, ready to crumble at a touch, as you retreated more and more from your duties, from yourself, from us. We needed Genji to raise us up. To give us our purpose, our rightful place in the world again.\u201d In a way Ryuzo was right. Genji had been both inspiration and teacher, not just to Kojuro, but the clan as a whole. He had shown them what they were capable of becoming. There had been hard years as Hizashi Mansion became a dark and neglected place and the only times he had seen Ryuzo was when he had deigned to notice him enough to pass some judgement on his latest exploit or lack of achievement in some area or other. \u201cFather, however much I admire Uncle Genji, how could that ever take away my love and respect for you?\u201d he said quietly, rather shocked at this revelation of his father's feelings. He felt his eyes prickling and blinked hard. \u201cDon't you remember how it used to be back when \u2013?\u201d back when mother was alive. Although he couldn't bring himself to say it. Maybe it was merely a coincidence that things were better  then, probably it was his own increasing incompetence and willfullness that had caused Ryuzo to withdraw from him in frustration. Kojuro was initially relieved to hear that Ryuzo was ready to pledge his sword, until there was one more caveat. \u201cI do ask you to,\u201d he agreed, \u201cand you will.  I will answer your question first out of respect you as my father, but regardless of the answer you will pledge me your sword.\u201d There was no hesitation or compromise in his voice on that point.

But whatever happens I will remain as Lord of Kiyonai until my appointed heir succeeds me.\u201d And he looked his father steadily in the eye. Regardless of whether that was enough of an answer for him, Kojuro nodded to samurai at the side of the room who brought forth a beautifully presented tachi with golden braid and the Hizashi crest in gold lacquer repeated along the scabbard, upon a black lacquer background where gold lacquer dusting added a star-like texture. The wrappings of the hilt were the maroon colour of the the clan crest. The samurai bowed before Kojuro presenting the sword with both hands, and he received it with one.

He knew that he had made a lot of mistakes and bad decisions, he had no wish to compound them even further when so much was at stake. But on this occasion, he truly felt that he was on the right track. To follow Genji's wishes, but to do so in a way that made sense to him.

I am... looking forward to seeing it.\" he said nodding, thinking if those words would comply better with Kojuro than his usual and more direct way of addressing issues.

Maybe he didn't think he could raise Kojuro well enough without her or maybe he still felt a deep shame for not being able to save her. Ryuzo listened intently to Kojuro and was slightly confused about what he was leading up to. \"Is Genji... not going to survive?!?\" Ryuzo said and was about to get up before resigning to the fact and burying his face in his hands sighing deeply. \"I feared as much...\" Ryuzo said and reluctantly folded his hands in front of him. \"Then pardon me for asking such in insolent question, I didn't know my brother was this far out.\" Ryuzo said to Kojuro. Despite their obvious differences Genji was still his brother and Ryuzo loved him much. \"I guess even for me Genji seemed almost invincible in his charisma and ambition and then for this... illness to claim him is hard to imagine.\" Ryuzo lamented.

It was short and to the point \u2013 a formal pledge was made and accepted, the words traditional. It was the first time for Kojuro to accept such a pledge and likely the first time Ryuzo would have to give it. At the end, Kojuro released the sword into Ryuzo\u2019s hands, symbolising once again his status as a samurai of House Hizashi. Once that was done, Kojuro seemed to un-tense a little.

Are you sure they won't strike out at us while we reach for Xuandao?\" Ryuzo inquired further. If this was what Kojuro was bent on doing, perhaps it was too late to talk him out of it, but surely the right time to scrutinize one's friends and enemies.

I\u2019m hoping that they will be occupied with that, but that does present another reason for us to move quickly. In the meanwhile, there will be many attempting to cross the border into Kiyonai.

I didn\u2019t think that you would be concerned with in the ins and outs so much, but if you have any improvements to suggest that would be valuable.\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure why Ryuzo found this last point so aggravating. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019d rather Genji-dono wasn\u2019t titled as Shogun either. But as a conqueror he would have that right, should the Son of Heaven see fit to grant it. But Homura-dono is neither a general or a daimyo. Shogun would be inappropriate, whereas Regent fits better. What is it that you would have him styled as?\u201d Kojuro knew how much Ryuzo loved to pick holes in things without ever making a better suggestion himself, but this time he didn\u2019t feel like letting him get away with it. \u201cBefore you go, there\u2019s something else,\u201d he said, as Ryuzo started to make his excuses to leave. \u201cI would like you to take over the plans for rebuilding Sarisu Island. It\u2019s been slow progress mainly because we haven\u2019t had anyone competent to manage a project of that scale. It would be well-suited to your skills. Yamazaki has sent the current documents over to your study so you can get acquainted.\u201d Obviously this wasn\u2019t as urgent as preparing for the war, so if Ryuzo wanted to be more involved with the strategy then he could put this to one side for the present. \u201cPlease remember that everything we have talked about here is confidential,\u201d he also noted in regard to Ryuzo heading off to write his letter to the House of Reason.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\u201cI said \u2018as bloodless "}, "post-83838": {"user": "Ryuzo Hizashi", "user_num": 2746, "timestamp": "1530653550000", "message": "\"Well now...

I've missed something to really busy my brain with since I came back.\" he said and smiled at the prospect. \"I'll get back with some written suggestions and we can discuss them in due time.\" Ryuzo said. \"Yes..?\" Ryuzo asked and stopped to listen before he had turned around completely. \"Well I didn't think Sarisu was that much in need of rebuilding, but if that is the case I'll take the task.\" Ryuzo said and nodded. At least there was one thing Kojuro couldn't criticize Ryuzo for, and that was the fact that he was thorough. If he was given a task, he would see it through the absolute completion regardless of how long that would take. \"Of course I think the war plans might take precedence, but I don't think I would be able to not talk to a few people and make the preliminary research needed to start such a project.\" Ryuzo mused. Ryuzo merely nodded to Kojuro telling him it was confidential. Kojuro clearly didn't trust Ryuzo fully yet, however a smile spread on Ryuzo's lips. \"Well, it was good talking to you.\" he said and paused to gauge if Kojuro wanted to ad more, and if not he would finally take his leave.

You may go.\u201d Ryuzo had smiled a good few times towards the end of their conversation, and for the most part, Kojuro pondered as he watched Ryuzo take his leave, not in a sarcastic way. When had he last seen his father smile at anything? He sensed that perhaps there was a way forward for them after all. He felt a great sense of relief as the doors closed behind Ryuzo. His father had not only agreed to rejoin the clan, but was generally supportive of his plans.
