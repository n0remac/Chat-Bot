Turning her attention to the indicated servant, the woman Nakatani, Aya's features smoothed into her usual impassive expression. She had heard rumours of the woman, of course, who hadn't? But she seemed to have great influence over Lord Genji and so she must be treated with extreme care. Aya acknowledged her with a polite nod and then followed her into the garden, carefully making sure to keep several paces behind her husband.\u00a0", "link_list": ["/post/67490/thread", "/user/2308"], "image_list": ["//storage.proboards.com/6046952/avatar/DxRvXxQNGmHGUfzaYuKh.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@sengoku\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/67490/thread\" timestamp=\"1495381461\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-2308\" title=\"Hosokawa Gentarou Masahiro\"><img alt=\"Hosokawa Gentarou Masahiro Avatar\" src=\"//storage.proboards.com/6046952/avatar/DxRvXxQNGmHGUfzaYuKh.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/67490/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1495381461000\" title=\"May 21, 2017 7:44:21 GMT -8\">May 21, 2017 7:44:21 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-2308 group-0\" href=\"/user/2308\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@sengoku\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Hosokawa Gentarou Masahiro</span></a></span> said:</div>Once Hizashi Kojuro had directed them to the capable hands of one of his liege's servants Nakatani, Masahiro inclined his head to the fledgling young master before turned his attention fully towards the other. Masahiro maintained that inscrutable mask as he stood beside his lady wife in his lacquered red armor while a retainer remained near with his helmet and spear in hand. The courtyard further became congested as sell-swords seemed to swell within. He was vaguely aware of the call to arms his lordship had sent out across the countryside. It concerned him, however, as he considered having so many untested and unknown swords so close to the venerable Hizashi-no-Kami. While he trusted in the wisdom of his liege he did not trust ronin - men who were no better than dogs, loyal to coin and by the will of the Heavens without masters of their own.<br><br/>Masahiro knew Nakatani only in passing as his presence before had largely been minimal at best before his promotion. So, the banner lord regarded the young woman warily though any suspicions were not notable features upon his visage. With regards to decorum and propriety the samurai offered her a respectful bow befitting her station and nothing more before he offered proper address.<br/><br/>\"The young lord Hizashi Kojuro bids you escort us to the gardens for tea, Nakatani-san. If you would please, show my lady wife and I there for tea,\" the warrior spoke.<div class=\"quote_clear\"></div></br></div></div>"}, "post-67523": {"user": "Kiara", "user_num": 2033, "timestamp": "1495395692000", "message": "Kiara watched Nakatani lead the others into the garden.

At times, it was easy to forget that the simple-minded Wuppo\u00a0had gone the bulk of his life feeding and providing for himself\u00a0on the mountain he called home, and the woodlands surrounding it. How long he'd been there was anyone's guess, but he seemed to be doing fine until a group of superstitious villagers set about trying to kill him for something he didn't fully\u00a0understand. This is where Kojuro had happened upon the ogre, and in declaring that the beast was under the protection of\u00a0the Hizashi\u00a0clan, had saved his life and home - and likely the lives of\u00a0no small number of\u00a0villagers.</p>"}, "post-70315": {"user": "Kojuro Hizashi", "user_num": 2287, "timestamp": "1499550115000", "message": "Kojuro wasn't someone who resorted to anger easily, and he certainly did his best not to act upon those feelings when he did have them, but there was definitely a coldness in his eyes as he spoke to Hosokawa.

If you wish to fight, your assistance is gladly accepted. Thank you,\" he said with a small bow towards the both of non-humans. \"However, you'd probably best not give Hosokawa-dono any presents, I think he has enough sticks to be getting on with, most of them very pointy.\" He gave a sly grin to Wuppo out of Hosokawa's eyeshot. \"We'll see about this bag later then?
