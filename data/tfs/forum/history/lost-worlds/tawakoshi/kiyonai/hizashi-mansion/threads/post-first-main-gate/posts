They could hear the laughs and jeering of men, many of whom were now drunk for the evening, and an entertaining flute hitting high notes as a part of some show. The Hizashi mansion certainly seemed festive for such an evening!The main gate would be discovered to be too dangerous. The walls doubled around the gate, forming a sort of vestibule or checking area, which would become a virtual death trap if anything went wrong. With the way the gate guards had been staggered, much of the wealth of options for simpler scenarios (the classic diversion, a silent takedown, etc) had been eliminated. Lord Genji was often considered frivolous, revolutionary, or even counter-culture by his peers, often to a fault. Yet this had a nature of disguising the true meddle of the Kiyonai warlord, who had guarded his manor meticulously and took all matters into scrutiny.This would leave only the walls to the right of the gate, where visibility by the guards would be less vigilant, and the rocky incline was capable of being scaled (by only the most skilled and courageous, and even then it was a gamble). Provided they made it up without issue, the walls of the compound themselves were not too tall to scale with some good equipment and perseverance, though they may be forced to hoist over a watchman over their own shoulders, given the roof-like inclines of the wall's top did not make for the same sort of grasp for grapple hooks that a European crenelation would.If they managed to sneak a pair of eyes over that wall, an already extremely risky endeavor, they'd notice all the people. The courtyard was very crowded, as festivities played out before them. A makeshift stage area had been formed, where actors played out various satires, some of which poked fun at the current Shogunate and the political state of Jeoncho.At this time, Lord Genji himself was nowhere to be seen, most assuredly within the innermost gardens.

As the 10ft tall ogre approached the gates of the Hizashi Mansion, it would become obvious he\u2019d also put \u2018bathing\u2019 into that same category, as almost all of him was covered in dried blood and dirt. The ogre had made no attempt to wash himself at all after the veritable bloodbath on the battlefield, and a few nights of him sleeping on the ground now saw dirt caked in with the blood (presumably still sticky when he laid down), which was now flaking off of him.Wuppo didn\u2019t seem to mind his filthiness as he walked in the company of Rena and Kojuro, carrying what at first might have appeared to be a giant canvas bag slung over his back. As his form came into focus, though, any onlookers (of which there would undoubtedly be many) would see that it was in fact a two-man tent that he\u2019d filled and now carried bundled up as an improvised bag. As the pack bumped along on the ogre\u2019s back, a (relatively) small, green, leafy orb would fall out of the tent material and land on the ground with a thump.

The sudden stop and turning around of such a big creature seemed to stir the horses behind him, which the tired ogre immediately took umbrage at.\u201cDis\u2019 MY green leafy bits!\u201d he said, his giant hand wrapped around the cabbage, which was now covered in dirt.It was unclear who Wuppo was talking to as he shoved the cabbage in his mouth, biting a huge chunk of it as he turned back around to continue walking towards the gates of the mansion. After two or three seconds of chewing, he stuffed the remaining bit of the cabbage into his maw, his mouth now completely full with the entire head of cabbage.

Marutaro turned the drawing to show Haya. \"Sorry, ma'am, I don't have any colours, just black. So ... I wrote the colours on.\" Next to the different items she had described, Marutaro had made annotations with the names of the colours written in tiny kanji.  Yamazaki nodded, pleased with the boy's work. When the extremely pretty servant girl had entered with the tea and he was halfway through drawing Marutaro blushed, and had stared at the paper far more intently than before until the redness faded from his cheeks.

She gave her a look of concern and half way opened her mouth, but ultimately just smiled softly as the servant girl served her tea. No one - woman or man - should have to wear bruises like that. They were not bruises of battle, they were bruises of abuse and it saddened Haya to see them on such a sweet young girl.

We are better equipped, larger in number, and hold more territory than ever before. The land has prospered. The facts in the ledgers speak for themselves.

There has been no drop in productivity,infiltration into our territories or notable dissent during that time. Genji-dono was in fact, back at the helm, at the time that Kojuro-dono was injured \u2013 not Kojuro-dono himself. Since then, it seems Genji-dono's condition has worsened once again.

In the course of this rescue they were set upon by a group of armed men, whom they killed between them, but not before Kojuro-dono was wounded by one of their number armed with a knife or small dagger.

Well I'll let fact settle that.\" he said and paused when Yamazaki moved to clarify things. \"Misconceptions? I have yet to meet anyone who's dedication towards facts would outdo yours. So if you can elaborate for me, I'd be very happy to hear.\"  Ryuzo said and crossed his arms. At the same time a servant girl who had been sent for by Yamazaki entered. And once she had poured both of them a cup of tea, she sat behind Ryuzo and started slowly massaging his shoulder and neck. Judging from his facial expression you'd hardly think Ryuzo noticed she started, but small satisfied grunts along the way revealed his satisfaction. \"I cannot judge whether they have grown stronger, I've been meditating in a forest the last few years.\" Ryuzo said with a wry smile, cracking something akin to a joke. He did believe Yamazaki's assessment, but frankly he was fed up with anything that sounded like Genji-adoration. Partly because he had come as Ryuzo's older brother and pushed Ryuzo from the leadership of the clan with everyone hailing Genji as the grand savior. But also because Ryuzo knew Genji as his brother and was aware that he wasn't at all the perfect lord they so longed for him to be. \"Regarding Kojuro I know very well you can only rule with the assistance of advisers for so long, and it is when he needs to make his own decisions the real test comes. That's why I'm here - to make sure he doesn't lose his focus as I suspect he did in this case.\" Ryuzo said. He had clearly calmed a lot, and the massage served to soften him up too, but nevertheless he felt convinced Kojuro needed his presence and action at this hour. \"I'm sure Sayuri-dono is busy tending to her husband as she should, thus I'm more interested in knowing what happened in the situation with Kojuro. You have taken your time explaining this.\" Ryuzo said with a slight frown. \"A report? I'd like to read that.\" he said and firmly removed the servant girl's hand from his shoulder. \"That would be fine for now thanks. Please fetch me this report that Yamazaki-san is speaking about will you?\" he asked sipping his tea in silence until the servant returned with this report. \"Thank you, please continue.\" he said as she resumed her massage duty while Ryuzo looked through the report his eyes fastening themselves to certain parts of the text.\"Why would you call this samurai unreliable, Yamazaki-san? After all he seems to be the only witness to have seen exactly what happened all the way through. Is it because he wasn't hand picked by Genji?\" he said dry and gave Yamazaki a brief glance. \"And this other witness you said was a servant girl... It is this Nakatani girl right?\" he wanted to get this fact clarified as Yamazaki somewhat seemed to separate those two as he explained it. Ryuzo squinted and started reading out loud from a particular part of the report. \"... As I approached Hizashi-dono (Kojuro Hizashi) in the dojo I explained that I saw a girl - who was likely a servant of the clan Hizashi - being abducted at the Kita Shrine... Hizashi-dono immediately commanded me to fetch his horse in order for us to go after the kidnapper.\" Ryuzo read and glanced at Yamazaki. \"What do you glean from this?\" Ryuzo asked Yamazaki rhetorically but moved to answer that himself. \"Kojuro went on a reckless rescue mission deep inside the forest with no backup what so ever. And that's fact.\" Ryuzo said and returned his gaze to the report. \"... We battled half a dozen bandits outside the shack where we had tracked the kidnapper to. Unfortunately Hizashi-dono stepped in to intercept an attack from one of the bandits and was stabbed in the stomach in the process.\" Ryuzo read out loud and paused to try to interpret what was written there. \"This... doesn't make sense. Did he drop his katana? It almost sounds like this samurai tried to cover the fact that Kojuro had moved to protect him by recklessly throwing himself in front of the attack.\" Ryuzo mused but of course couldn't conclude anything solid. \"If this samurai Sou Yasuke had my interest, where could I seek him out?\" he asked, having gleaned what he wanted. \"And how about this servant girl, Nakatani? I'd like to speak to her too.\" he said. Ryuzo had already arrived at the provisional conclusion that Kojuro had some kind of close relationship with these two. \"Ohh yes, and please also tell Anzen about my arrival. I suspect she's excited to see her dad after such a long time, but please let her know it will have to wait a bit.\" Ryuzo added lastly.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Ryuzo listened to Yamazaki pointing to the fact that he was indeed a monk of reason and had it been anything but his stoic voice, he might not have been swayed that easily and may even had directed his anger towards the given person.

As they progressed, their number had dwindled. Aritomo Kumagai had left them at Kasen no Tochi, no longer a border post, but a castle central to Hizashi lands that looked out upon them in all directions. Katsutora Ikeda had gone south to his own lands, and still others of the Hizashi forces that had left Kiyonai for Jeoncho, such as Shogo Urabe, had stayed there, to take possession of the domain now held by Homura Hizashi on behalf of Genji\u2019s unborn child. Yasuke hadn't even begun the journey back with them, instead having taken himself west to Quying to find his long-lost sister. It wasn't something Kojuro could begrudge, as much as he missed having his friend by his side.\u00a0Others, however, were headed all the way back to the Hizashi\u2019s traditional stronghold in the mountains east of Kiyonai City.

The imperial dragon banner flew alongside the Hizashi clan crest, and samurai armour gleamed in the late summer sunshine. But impressive as the column was, it was somber. Their old liege lord was dead, and all the clan was still in mourning for Lord Genji. As the landscapes became more and more familiar and evoked more memories of home, Kojuro found a sense of urgency leaving him. He had wanted to make the journey back to Kiyonai as soon as logistics and politeness would allow. Although he would inevitably miss Genji\u2019s funeral no matter how early they started out, the death of his uncle had hit him hard, and established a sense of homesickness he found hard to shake. Familiarity was comforting, and he missed the simplicity of Kiyonai life and its people, the beauty of its city, and most of all the loved ones left behind. It seemed like a different life in which he had left Nakatani waiting at the mansion for his safe return. Eventually the Hizashi Mansion came into view nestled amongst the mountains, and he felt a certain easing of tension at the sight.

She was almost glad when he called out another person's name, returning her to the reality of the situation. They were very much public. As the young boy bowed before her she smiled at him and gave him a small bow back. \"I am very glad to meet you, Masanori-san. Please feel welcome in the Hizashi estate.\" she said, her smile never wielding. Sayuri-san had drilled her for hours, trying to explain the proper amount of bow giving for the status of the people she would meet. She still struggled with it most of the time, but seemed to get more of a hang for it. As just a maid anyone would have been higher in ranking then her and she had always learned to bow low. It was a big change to now have people bow low to her instead. When the party started to move around her, Nakatani started to take in the faces of all the man that were returning. Making note of who she saw, but more importantly of the ones she didn't. She would be sure to visit the quarters of the samurai later, she wanted to know if any of the ones who had always been so kind to her had perished in the battle. She soon forgot about this when Kojuro pulled her aside though. She looked up into his eyes, seeing the sparkle in there that she so loved. \"I missed you too... I have been so worried about you,\" she said softly and almost moved up to kiss him when she noticed something else in his eyes. She immediately cast her eyes down, she forgot about the most important part again, driven by her own selfish need of being with him. \"I am so sorry for your loss Koju-kun.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Her heart warmed when he called out her name, the thumping in her chest returning at once.
