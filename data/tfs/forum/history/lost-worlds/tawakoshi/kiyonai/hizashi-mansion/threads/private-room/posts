Not everyone you consider your friend is your friend, and not everyone you consider your enemy, are really your enemy.\" he said and mused. \"So in a way deceiving your friends might be something you actually have to until certain things are unveiled.

Maybe because we didn't exactly part on the best terms last time.\" Zu Fu said with a smirk and chuckled. \"Do you think I was jesting, Lord Hizashi?\" Zu Fu asked with a glint in his eye. \"From a slightly higher perspective the one who fails a lot, learns a lot too. While the one who doesn't fail, rarely finds true wisdom.\" he said with a warm smile. \"I don't know very much about Kiyonai City, I only come here so rarely. Where would you suggest a good place might be? I come from The Temple of The Wind Singer so I would definitely prefer if it wasn't the most bustling district.\" he said and grinned. \"But I am in no position to be difficult, a roof would be nice though. And a guest room until then is more than acceptable.\" Zu Fu added.\"I am always volunteering my own services to those who ask me. It is however the first time I am offering them to people like this, but I believe it is part of my path.\" Zu Fu said and took a deep breath. \"There are many magical beings in Tawakoshi and I will assist with counselling and handling of these beings whenever the need arises. Well, and then there is another and more immediate thing, but I'll need you to accept me into such a position before I can tell you more about it...\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"Lord Kojuro, it is not easy to tell you, but you must understand that there are some battles where the soldier must find the way himself.\" Zu Fu said and took a deep breath closing his eyes for a moment before opening them again. \"And from what the spirits around the mansion tell me Genji is facing his most difficult battle yet.\" Zu Fu said and nodded to Kojuro. \"However I believe with Kazue around here to inspire the lesser spirits, Lord Genji well be in the best possible place to make his way towards healing - though it will be difficult, Lord Kojuro.\" Zu Fu said and sighed.

Repeating the same mistakes again and again wasn\u2019t working for him anymore, and it was time to start making some new ones.Kojuro assured Zu Fu that he would be found something suitable to his needs. The noble district was quiet enough as the dwellings were placed far apart, but no town location was ever going to be as peaceful as a temple. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting proposition,\u201d he said, feeling his not-inconsiderable curiosity piqued, \u201cIt\u2019s not something I have considered, but \u2026 in fact it would fill a large gap in our knowledge. The spirits are a mystery to me, and to many of the clan. We are only bushi after all. It\u2019s hard to think of any objections.\u201d Although he was naturally intrigued by the idea, he did try at least to think of a good reason why he wouldn\u2019t accept the offer, but could not come up with one. \u201cI would be honoured to have your advice in spiritual matters, Zu Fu sensei,\u201d he agreed with an amiable smile.

Of course not considering yourself.\" Zu Fu asked. Maybe the guy would share some of his knowledge with Zu Fu and he could learn more about the life of the samurai with which he was about to get involved. \"I mentioned we had business to discuss, but I believe this business can wait a few days.
