When the conversation took another turn to him asking who would be the one to protect her, she knew she was stuck. She was not supposed to talk about her romance with Kojuro. If Kojuro wished to talk about it to others, that was his choice. But she couldn't make it public herself, it would damage his honor. So instead of answering him she would slowly get to her feet. \"Actually, Sou-san. I have enjoyed our talk so far, but as you said I am merely a servant in this mansion. I got many tasks to take care of and I am sure I am being missed by now for my duties. If you would excuse me.\" she said and bowed deeply for him, smiling the best that she could with how uncomfortable she was feeling and would make her way towards the door.

She bit her lip before she continued to talk and made sure to put down the teapot before she said anything else. \"A few days ago I was kidnapped away from a shrine that I frequently visit. There are not many others who go there so I have reason to believe I was targetted. I was tied and blindfolded and taken to a cabin for questioning. If you don't mind I would like to refrain from telling you about what the questions were. After my kidnapper left me guarded by other outlaw and left himself, to where I am unsure. It was a good hour, maybe more, before I heard sounds outside. It seems that Sou-san had seen me being taken and had gone back to the mansion to inform Kojuro-sama about it. Together they came to rescue me.\" She paused, her hands trembling slightly around the cup she was holding, the liquid just barely not spilling out. \"Every time I hear his voice, a panic settles deep inside of me. A fear that I can't explain. I don't remember the voice of my kidnapper, just Sou-san's voice... I can't help but think that that fear means something. Do you think Sou-san could have framed this? To make a good name for himself within the Hizashi clan?\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "And so they would walk back through the hallways to the way they came. On the way Nakatani made sure that fresh tea would be prepared for them and brought to Haya's room so they could at least have their conversation with a cup of tea to drink from. After all, holding a cup or pouring tea still felt like a defensive mechanism for Nakatani. Noone would think rude of her to think over her words for a few moments, if those moments were taken by taking a sip of her drink.
