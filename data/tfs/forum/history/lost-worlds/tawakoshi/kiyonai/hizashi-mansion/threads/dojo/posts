Anzen Hizashi was the primary target of instruction, as her formal experience with the blade was possibly much less than Kojuro's or Genji's. There would be times where Kojuro could possibly shine, showing her by example how best to follow Tika's instructions as they'd be similar to his own when he was a child. They covered the barest of basics that were usually taught starting very young and were often shrouded in ritual.To draw the longer katana from its position at the hip, she would explain while demonstrating with her own blade, the right arm making a simple pulling motion--while intuitive--would not be sufficient to clear the kissaki from the scabbard. Instead, the sword's point would find friction against the wooden inside of the saya once most of the blade was exposed. Tika explained that continued pressure or bad form trying to draw like this would cause the kissaki to bite into the wood of the inside of the scabbard and eventually crack it, causing extremely expensive and possible irreversible damage to it.To counter this inevitability,\u00a0she emphasized the importance of sayabiki. Anzen would learn that this was an important mechanic of the drawing motion. This time, Tika drew her sword into a graceful arc before her. However, she demonstrated that both of her arms were working in unison--one drawing the sword, but the other pulling the saya backward in obi, a motion often hidden by the excitement and speed of the katana's often flashy quick-draws, but necessary to facilitate it all the same. By opening with both arms moving in opposing directions, the sword's blade became exposed in about half the time it took to draw from the arm, and the possibility of the weapon stabbing the inside of the sheath on its way out (by virtue of its length alone) had been effectively mitigated. Anzen received ample instruction to practice this regardless of the length of her slightly-shorter kodachi, because as a member of a samurai family, she expected Lord Genji would want her comfortable wielding all swords by building a solid core foundation in muscle memory.Tika spent about a half hour on this, given that her students would need to drill this a few times in repetition. Once she became satisfied with progress in the \"smoothness\" of their draws, she moved onto grip. This was a simple few minutes of explanation, where emphasis was made on gripping the sword tightly with the pinky and ring fingers and holding progressively weaker down the hand. Having a tight grip near the pinky and a loose grip at the thumb and forefinger provided a long, handheld stick-like object a much greater range of motion in both wrists than a thoroughly tight grip would allow.Once that was done and over with, she covered the concept of noto, or resheathing the sword. This, in and of itself, would be worth whole months of lesson material, given its various complications. Tika explained how there were many different styles of chiburi, or the removing of blood from the sword, but that such a thing would be covered in future, more focused lessons. For this day, she covered only the scenario of returning a sword to its scabbard without having cut any targets. This involved sliding the mune (spine) of the sword down its length while it rested upon the koiguchi (scabbard opening). From this motion, the kissaki would drop into the scabbard's opening and she'd pull both the sheath and the sword back together again with both hands. From the look of it, reducing the need for the fingers to guide the sword and keep it atop the saya without it falling off would take much practice in muscle memory (practice Kojuro most likely had a good deal of), and to this she made emphasis because Anzen would be expected to be able to instinctively put away her razor-sharp sword without looking at where its point is going. This was an important aspect of training with the sword that simply could not be skimmed over, because as Lord Genji had entrusted her to teach a member of a ranking samurai family on use of a weapon, it was to be assumed that one day, she may find herself in a battlefield scenario. For Anzen to be able to draw and put away her sword instinctively while keeping her eyes on the situation rather than her sword, she'd mitigate a major timing of weakness that could be taken advantage of (Tika felt it necessary to remind her that a samurai is expected to be, as is typical sentiment, \"ready at all times\").They had barely scratched the surface of the basics, but they were basics Tika had to learn before she was even allowed to begin sparring as a child. Every aspect of these minuscule details breathed the threat of death on a potential battlefield and the numerous ways that could happen in a not-actually-dueling manner, and hopefully Anzen was beginning to see how the training was not just about sparring competence, but of good muscle memory and situational awareness.Then, afternoon arrived. Because this was the first lesson, she felt she needed to cover everything very briefly to gauge where their strengths and weaknesses lay.

Kojuro began to get the feeling that he was being watched, although it certainly didn't seem to be hostile, unlike the creeping feeling he had had at the festival. Looking at the dojo door out of the corner of his eye he saw something small and furry peeking into the room, the ears and paws of a little fox. \"Onee-san, don't feel self-conscious but it looks like we have an audience,\" he said to Anzen, as they carried their bokken back to the centre of the room, and nodded his head in the direction of the fox.Kojuro stood opposite his sister and bowed, before taking a basic mid-level stance holding the hilt of the bokken at waist height, the tip of the sword pointing diagonally upwards directly towards Anzen's head. His weight on both feet, and ready to move into attack or defence, he waited for Tika's signal to begin, then wasted no time in going on the offensive against Anzen, raising the bokken above his head and closing the distance a pace so that she was in range of his katana-length bokken, but he was still outside of the shorter distance her kodachi could reach. He brought the bokken down towards her head, ready to stop before it connected with her if she failed to dodge or counter. A smack on the head with a bokken could be just as lethal as a live blade if the combatants weren't pulling their punches. Anzen would be used to his speed, likely he wasn't as fast as usual given he was somewhat out of practice, but the aggression of his attack would be something she was familiar with facing, albeit with a longer weapon in her hands.

Anzen Hizashi was the primary target of instruction, as her formal experience with the blade was possibly much less than Kojuro's or Genji's. There would be times where Kojuro could possibly shine, showing her by example how best to follow Tika's instructions as they'd be similar to his own when he was a child. They covered the barest of basics that were usually taught starting very young and were often shrouded in ritual.To draw the longer katana from its position at the hip, she would explain while demonstrating with her own blade, the right arm making a simple pulling motion--while intuitive--would not be sufficient to clear the kissaki from the scabbard. Instead, the sword's point would find friction against the wooden inside of the saya once most of the blade was exposed. Tika explained that continued pressure or bad form trying to draw like this would cause the kissaki to bite into the wood of the inside of the scabbard and eventually crack it, causing extremely expensive and possible irreversible damage to it.To counter this inevitability,\u00a0she emphasized the importance of sayabiki. Anzen would learn that this was an important mechanic of the drawing motion. This time, Tika drew her sword into a graceful arc before her. However, she demonstrated that both of her arms were working in unison--one drawing the sword, but the other pulling the saya backward in obi, a motion often hidden by the excitement and speed of the katana's often flashy quick-draws, but necessary to facilitate it all the same. By opening with both arms moving in opposing directions, the sword's blade became exposed in about half the time it took to draw from the arm, and the possibility of the weapon stabbing the inside of the sheath on its way out (by virtue of its length alone) had been effectively mitigated. Anzen received ample instruction to practice this regardless of the length of her slightly-shorter kodachi, because as a member of a samurai family, she expected Lord Genji would want her comfortable wielding all swords by building a solid core foundation in muscle memory.Tika spent about a half hour on this, given that her students would need to drill this a few times in repetition. Once she became satisfied with progress in the \"smoothness\" of their draws, she moved onto grip. This was a simple few minutes of explanation, where emphasis was made on gripping the sword tightly with the pinky and ring fingers and holding progressively weaker down the hand. Having a tight grip near the pinky and a loose grip at the thumb and forefinger provided a long, handheld stick-like object a much greater range of motion in both wrists than a thoroughly tight grip would allow.Once that was done and over with, she covered the concept of noto, or resheathing the sword. This, in and of itself, would be worth whole months of lesson material, given its various complications. Tika explained how there were many different styles of chiburi, or the removing of blood from the sword, but that such a thing would be covered in future, more focused lessons. For this day, she covered only the scenario of returning a sword to its scabbard without having cut any targets. This involved sliding the mune (spine) of the sword down its length while it rested upon the koiguchi (scabbard opening). From this motion, the kissaki would drop into the scabbard's opening and she'd pull both the sheath and the sword back together again with both hands. From the look of it, reducing the need for the fingers to guide the sword and keep it atop the saya without it falling off would take much practice in muscle memory (practice Kojuro most likely had a good deal of), and to this she made emphasis because Anzen would be expected to be able to instinctively put away her razor-sharp sword without looking at where its point is going. This was an important aspect of training with the sword that simply could not be skimmed over, because as Lord Genji had entrusted her to teach a member of a ranking samurai family on use of a weapon, it was to be assumed that one day, she may find herself in a battlefield scenario. For Anzen to be able to draw and put away her sword instinctively while keeping her eyes on the situation rather than her sword, she'd mitigate a major timing of weakness that could be taken advantage of (Tika felt it necessary to remind her that a samurai is expected to be, as is typical sentiment, \"ready at all times\").They had barely scratched the surface of the basics, but they were basics Tika had to learn before she was even allowed to begin sparring as a child. Every aspect of these minuscule details breathed the threat of death on a potential battlefield and the numerous ways that could happen in a not-actually-dueling manner, and hopefully Anzen was beginning to see how the training was not just about sparring competence, but of good muscle memory and situational awareness.Then, afternoon arrived. Because this was the first lesson, she felt she needed to cover everything very briefly to gauge where their strengths and weaknesses lay. Because of that process, this would not simply be a slow, child-like progression into an increasingly less-cryptic world of swordplay. Tika had to dive right into the more exhilarating, competitive aspects of training at some time today, and so after covering basics and some repetitions, both would be instructed to retrieve a wooden bokken from the wall. Their swords would remain at their hips.Both students would be instructed to face one another. Stance, style, all of that would be covered later. Tika was simply here to observe, now, and explained to Anzen not to feel alarmed at the lack of actual combative teachings yet before starting a practice bout--this was simply to figure out where their strengths and weaknesses were. She stood beside the two and backed up several paces.\"And now bow..... good, very good, now take your stance. You may begin.\"All the while she remained unaware herself of the fox outside the dojo floor, because she was so strongly focused on teaching, worried if they were absorbing it all instead of simply staring through her. Ironically, teaching made her feel like a student again... to the last time she ever felt so self-conscious.

Anzen Hizashi was the primary target of instruction, as her formal experience with the blade was possibly much less than Kojuro's or Genji's. There would be times where Kojuro could possibly shine, showing her by example how best to follow Tika's instructions as they'd be similar to his own when he was a child. They covered the barest of basics that were usually taught starting very young and were often shrouded in ritual.<br><br/>To draw the longer katana from its position at the hip, she would explain while demonstrating with her own blade, the right arm making a simple pulling motion--while intuitive--would not be sufficient to clear the kissaki from the scabbard. Instead, the sword's point would find friction against the wooden inside of the saya once most of the blade was exposed. Tika explained that continued pressure or bad form trying to draw like this would cause the kissaki to bite into the wood of the inside of the scabbard and eventually crack it, causing extremely expensive and possible irreversible damage to it.<br/>To counter this inevitability,\u00a0she emphasized the importance of <i>sayabiki</i>. Anzen would learn that this was an important mechanic of the drawing motion. This time, Tika drew her sword into a graceful arc before her. However, she demonstrated that both of her arms were working in unison--one drawing the sword, but the other pulling the saya backward in obi, a motion often hidden by the excitement and speed of the katana's often flashy quick-draws, but necessary to facilitate it all the same. By opening with both arms moving in opposing directions, the sword's blade became exposed in about half the time it took to draw from the arm, and the possibility of the weapon stabbing the inside of the sheath on its way out (by virtue of its length alone) had been effectively mitigated. Anzen received ample instruction to practice this regardless of the length of her slightly-shorter kodachi, because as a member of a samurai family, she expected Lord Genji would want her comfortable wielding <i>all </i>swords by building a solid core foundation in muscle memory.<br/><br/>Tika spent about a half hour on this, given that her students would need to drill this a few times in repetition. Once she became satisfied with progress in the \"smoothness\" of their draws, she moved onto grip. This was a simple few minutes of explanation, where emphasis was made on gripping the sword tightly with the pinky and ring fingers and holding progressively weaker down the hand. Having a tight grip near the pinky and a loose grip at the thumb and forefinger provided a long, handheld stick-like object a much greater range of motion in both wrists than a thoroughly tight grip would allow.<br/><br/>Once that was done and over with, she covered the concept of <i>noto</i>, or resheathing the sword. This, in and of itself, would be worth whole months of lesson material, given its various complications. Tika explained how there were many different styles of <i>chiburi</i>, or the removing of blood from the sword, but that such a thing would be covered in future, more focused lessons. For this day, she covered only the scenario of returning a sword to its scabbard without having cut any targets. This involved sliding the <i>mune</i> (spine) of the sword down its length while it rested upon the <i>koiguchi </i>(scabbard opening). From this motion, the kissaki would drop into the scabbard's opening and she'd pull both the sheath and the sword back together again with both hands. From the look of it, reducing the need for the fingers to guide the sword and keep it atop the saya without it falling off would take much practice in muscle memory (practice Kojuro most likely had a good deal of), and to this she made emphasis because Anzen would be expected to be able to instinctively put away her razor-sharp sword <i>without </i>looking at where its point is going. This was an important aspect of training with the sword that simply could not be skimmed over, because as Lord Genji had entrusted her to teach a member of a ranking samurai family on use of a weapon, it was to be assumed that one day, she may find herself in a battlefield scenario. For Anzen to be able to draw and put away her sword instinctively while keeping her eyes on the situation rather than her sword, she'd mitigate a major timing of weakness that could be taken advantage of (Tika felt it necessary to remind her that a samurai is expected to be, as is typical sentiment, \"ready at all times\").<br/><br/>They had barely scratched the surface of the basics, but they were basics Tika had to learn before she was even allowed to begin sparring as a child. Every aspect of these minuscule details breathed the threat of death on a potential battlefield and the numerous ways that could happen in a not-actually-dueling manner, and hopefully Anzen was beginning to see how the training was not just about sparring competence, but of good muscle memory and situational awareness.<br/><br/>Then, afternoon arrived. Because this was the first lesson, she felt she needed to cover everything very briefly to gauge where their strengths and weaknesses lay. Because of that process, this would not simply be a slow, child-like progression into an increasingly less-cryptic world of swordplay. Tika had to dive right into the more exhilarating, competitive aspects of training at some time <i>today</i>, and so after covering basics and some repetitions, both would be instructed to retrieve a wooden bokken from the wall. Their swords would remain at their hips.<br/><br/>Both students would be instructed to face one another. Stance, style, all of that would be covered later. Tika was simply here to observe, now, and explained to Anzen not to feel alarmed at the lack of actual combative teachings yet before starting a practice bout--this was simply to figure out where their strengths and weaknesses were. She stood beside the two and backed up several paces.<br/><br/>\"And now bow..... good, very good, now take your stance. You may begin.\"<br/><br/>All the while she remained unaware herself of the fox outside the dojo floor, because she was so strongly focused on teaching, worried if they were absorbing it all instead of simply staring through her. Ironically, teaching made her feel like a student again... to the last time she ever felt <i>so </i>self-conscious.

Yasuke would go through the way of doing it a couple of times before actually doing it. To execute the throw Yasuke would push Kojuro's right leg away with his own right leg and at the moment of unbalance, he had lowered his hip and pushed it towards Kojuros. Using one hand grabbing Kojuro's gi and the other tugged around his left arm as he turned around, he executed a throw over his shoulder that would have Kojuro landing on the tatami on his back. \"Ohh... are you used to doing ukemi?(fall)\" Yasuke asked as he out of habit had thrown him pretty hard into the tatami.
