They didn't need to wait too long for everyone to arrive, and once that was done, Kojuro could pause in his tea drinking to address the assembled group. \u201cWuppo here, who I'm sure you've all met or at least are aware of...\" he nodded towards the ogre, \u201chas a magical bag, where items go in \u2026 and then disappear. There are two items that we need to retreive from it. The first is a magical ocarina belonging to a friend of Wuppo's and a guest of the Hizashi clan, Rena Kesarus. I have made a personal promise to both Wuppo and Rena that I will find a way to get the instrument back to Rena, so that she can return to her homeland. This is the most important part of the mission. The other item is a sword - a katana that Sou Yasuke accidentally lost in the bag, and I feel a little responsible for that happening too...\u201d he gave a wry smile reflecting back on how he had essentially tricked Yasuke into throwing his sword in the bag just for his own amusement. In a commanding voice he stated, \u201cToday, we will enter this bag ourselves, hopefully to discover where the items go that have disappeared, and see if we can bring them back. It's possible that we won't get anywhere, but it's also possible that if we can get out, then things may emerge from the bag into the Hizashi Mansion, hence the extra guards.\u201dHe looked over towards some men with large reels of scarlet cord. \u201cWe will attach ourselves to a cord, in order to have a way back out.

Of course he would come. Kojuro was the only other being Wuppo counted among his friends in the world, and would come to Kojuro's residence whenever asked; he'd come for no reason at all, so it would seem foolish to ask for a reason. Once at the mansion, Kojuro, knowing well Wuppo's great love of tea, would offer him some tea; as strange as it might seem, an ogre drinking tea.Of all the things for the lumbering, dimwitted giant to take a liking to, tea seemed the least likely. In the years before he'd met Kojuro, Wuppo had spent a lot of time observing the ritual of tea-drinking from afar, and then tried to mimic it the best he could with what he'd had at his disposal. This meant broken discarded bowls and wooden cups, and tea made from just about anything he could find in the wilderness; tree leaves, bush berries, twigs and sticks. It was only after he'd met Kojuro that the ogre had been introduced to what the humans would call a proper tea, and would then be able to mimic the taste of actual tea with the things he could find on his mountain. Also, at his cave, Wuppo now had the makings of a real tea service - as chipped and cracked as the porcelain and glass bits may have been.At the Hizashi mansion, Wuppo was served tea in a large white bowl with a delicate floral pattern hand-painted on the side of it. He smiled as if he was trying to show every one of the teeth in his mouth as the bowl was set on the veranda in front of him, and filled with piping hot tea. Wuppo lowered his face down to the bowl, and sniffed the air above the steaming herbal potion. After breathing in a few lungfuls of the steam, he reached his large hand out, and touched just the tip of his index finger to the side of the bowl. He pushed his finger tangentially along the ornate painting on the side of the vessel, turning it bit by bit. Wuppo lowered his head down to the side of the bowl (which was still sitting on the floor of the veranda), appearing to examine the flowers as they scrolled by with each gentle poke of his finger.\"Hmmm..\" Wuppo said, squinting a bit at the side of the bowl, obviously examining it closely. After a moment, he added, \"Das some nice dainty bits.\"It appeared that the ogre's discerning eye for quality tea vessels had ruled this particular bowl more than adequate for tea consumption, though it was anyone's guess what criteria the giant might be using. It was only now that Wuppo realized there were more humans, which seemed to neither surprise him nor stop his odd behavior. Tea was about ritual, and Wuppo saw no reason the ritual of tea couldn't continue while Kojuro told the humans about his bag.Wuppo did nod his head at the mention of the ocarina, stopping with his tea long enough to add; \"Das nice horselady fing!\"The ogre's voice was deep, gravelly, and perhaps just a bit louder than what would be appropriate for the serine setting of such a beautiful garden. When Kojuro asked if there were any questions, Wuppo seemed to have one.\"Wise Otta!\" he said as he straightened his back, looking up from his tea. \"How we'z get da Otta in me bag? Dis bag only for da fings I don' like! An' wise Otta, him good. Him what gots da dragonbug. Puttin' nice fings in me bag, das what get we'z here now!\"Wuppo obviously had concerns about putting more people and things of valuable in the bag that he was convinced was only for the things he didn't like.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "If the ogre had any questions at all when Kojuro showed up at his cave requesting that he bring his bag to the Hizashi Mansion, Wuppo kept them to himself.

Since the Hizashi troops learned to do everything in armour, including swimming across rivers, it didn't impede their activity too much if they were used to wearing it.
