Across the front were scars from precise cuts in varying sizes, but all of them trying to heal. Her wrists were scarred with ligature marks.The hardest part was revealing her legs - more marks. Places that had split from lashes, more bruises. Her ankles bore more ligature marks that had cut in shallowly. But she found out when her skin was bared that there were still stains of blood to her inner thighs, though just a few spots. Every mark was a grim reminder that she didn't want.Removing the bindings around the middle and ring fingers of her hands was painful enough to make her gasp, almost crying out.
