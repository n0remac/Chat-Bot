The streams of condensed water burst into the catapults severing and rending its wooden structured as the men around them who weren't caught in the torrents of water fled from the catapults and the opposing power they had no means of defending against. The fact that the streams could rip along the shore meant that many hidden catapults that had yet to be fired were destroyed and a whole ten of the Xuandao catapults had been disabled by the Quying attack. \"Go for the head ship, the head ship!\" one of the officers yelled to his men at one of the two catapults that was still functioning as they took aim.
