The owner, Yakumo-san, is a kind and charming, young man who seems to know an awfully lot about the city and what there is to do and 'not to do' - even if you want to do the latter. The silks are of a very high quality and as a regular customer - and upon polite request - he might be able to procure more 'delicate' wares for you. Maybe something sharp to cut the fabric? Or maybe something to roll the fabric around? Only the customer's ideas sets the limit... and of course the depth of their purse.\u00a0", "link_list": ["https://flic.kr/p/2581YWt"], "image_list": ["https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4773/40773526631_9ef1ccb23f_b.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/2581YWt\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4773/40773526631_9ef1ccb23f_b.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/></a></div>"}}
