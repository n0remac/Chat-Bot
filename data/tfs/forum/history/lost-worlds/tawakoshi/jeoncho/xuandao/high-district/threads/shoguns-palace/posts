Perhaps the worst of it was that the ogre himself had come a hair's breadth from failing his only reason for being there at all; protecting the 'Wize Otta'.Wuppo put down the large wooden wagon he was carrying in his right hand; small number of arrows sticking out of the thick wood of the wagon's bed, an artifact of its time being used as an improvised shield from archers. Wuppo was about to bash down a door, or baring that perhaps even a hole in the wall, when Kojuro stated their need to enter the palace - but before he was able to do it, Hitsufune appeared with the body of the Shogun. Yasuke moved quickly to immobilize Hitsufune, and as Kojuro confirmed the identity of the body, Wuppo moved over the now deceased warlord.Bending down, Wuppo used the index finger of his gloved hand to give the body of the shogun a powerful poke, which would have been more like being kicked in the chest given the difference in size. Wuppo waited for a short time, and poked him again - at least equally as hard. \"Dis Shoo-gone?\" he said aloud, appearing to talk to no one in particular. To Wuppo, there didn't seem to be anything at all special or extraordinary about the person that lay on the ground before him. All of this, the ogre thought, for a simple man. Wuppo pursed his lips, and let out a low growl as he grabbed the Shogun's body in his giant hand. Wuppo picked the man up, and straightened his back, now holding the limp and lifeless body to his side.It wasn't clear what Wuppo intended to do with the body, and perhaps he didn't even know himself.. but they'd come all this way for the Shogun and Wuppo was not leaving him here.

The guy who made all the bad things happen.\" Yasuke said and crossed his arms observing Wuppo. It still amazed him how the ogre was able to carry a small wagon for a shield and how a single poke could make a dead body roll over.

But you and I... We're going to look for a place to get a cup of sake!\" he said and padded ogre on the back. \"Well... you might need a barrel of sake, but I'm sure it's in the spirits of 'Wize Otta' to sponsor a bit of fun for his two trusty life guards that got him living through this right?\" he said jestingly and donned a wry smile as he turned towards Kojuro.
