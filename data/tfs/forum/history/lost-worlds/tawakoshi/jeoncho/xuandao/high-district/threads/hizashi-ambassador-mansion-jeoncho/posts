The clothes would not be showy, but you'd definitely recognize the fact that they weren't cheap. Wearing a slightly wry but also soft smile he gently sat down at the end of the table and nodded to the servant who would leave the room and close the shoji door behind her. \"Welcome my guests.\" he said with a clear and warm voice as he gently made eye contact with the guests to acknowledge them individually. The old man with the wooden staff and the stern looking guy seemeed to Homura to be seasoned adventures, but he wondered for what reason the beautiful woman with the strikingly blue eyes seemed to be there. Was she going along with him? He knew that both the vast reaches of Tawakoshi and the rest of the Overworld held many very different people, which was he was perhaps most surprised to see the plain looking young women there. She could hardly had come here by mistake, as she had to have shown the note at the door. However to Homura this didn't matter, these people looked like they had a very diverse set of skills, and he himself was eager to present to them, what he had brought along with him in the black wooden casket on his lap. \"As you may or may not have guessed there is no 'Uchino Soke', that guy is me, Homura Hizashi. I am the ambassador of clan Hizashi here in Jeoncho, and because the current shogun here in Jeoncho and clan Hizashi in Kiyonai... have some disagreements... I would rather not have attention drawn towards me. That is however irrelevant for what I will ask of you here.\" he said and moved the box to the low table and opened it up. \"Behold the masterpiece The Glass Dragon. Forged 800 years ago by unknown means and still as pristine looking as was it new!\" he said proudly while gently holding the artifact up before him so everyone had a chance to see it. To the eye the dragon seemed to be made by thousands of shards of glass that - while translucent - had a distinct way of reflecting the light - somewhat like crystal would. It was light as paper on his hand and all these pieces were individually segmented by joints. Homura took a nearby fan a waved it gently at the dragon as it caught the wind and immediately starting moving in his hand as if it was a real dragon - only to stop when he put the fan down. \"What do you make of this? It most likely holds one of the best kept secrets in the history of Tawakoshi.\" he said and smirked. \"But before I tell you more, I'd very much like to hear who you are? Care to introduce yourselves first?\" he asked politely, curious as to which kind of people they were and if they had any special motivation for coming here at all.

Ayame-san, you may or may not have heard about it, but maybe some of this will be new to you anyway.\" Homura said and contemplated where to start. \"Dragons haven't been seen in Tawakoshi for many centuries now, but it is a fact, that dragons in many forms and sizes once inhabited Tawakoshi. As any real or credible knowledge about their existence and disappearance have been lost in time, we can only guess why they disappeared. But we know with some certainty that empress Aihara Mina had one of the last great dragons in her possession nearly 800 years ago.\" Homura said and looked around. This alone should have piqued people's interests, but there were more to the story. \"It is said to have ended tragically despite a close bond between the two. The dragon unfortunately died when she was only 15 years of age and it has officially been recorded that she left at the age of 17 and headed to the mountains to take her own life out of sorrow. The Glass Dragon is said to have disappeared shortly after.\" He said in a concise manner. \"This is however probably not the truth! My studies indicate that the dragon you see in front of you is a map of some kind - and I'm almost certain that the empress didn't leave it behind but actually brought it with her, as she was looking for something specific.\" Homura stated with a grave expression. \"And of how and why this dragon came into her possession we know little. But a single place in the annals it is mentioned, that she was given the glass dragon by a wizard when she was ten years old.\" he said. \"This is where you come in. I think this worth an expedition to follow the clues and figure out, what really happened to the empress and why she journeyed out.\" Homura said with a relieved smile as he once again looked at the book Ayame had brought with her. \"Do you think, that you could look through the pages and see if it indicates any places in Tawakoshi one might know?\" Homura asked Ayame and handed her back the book. \"I am pretty sure, that this book was at least partly written by the empress herself!\" he said and looked at the group. \"Any questions are welcome, I won't hide anything for you.\" he simply said with a friendly smile.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Homura listened to their individual explanations with great interest.

If we can somehow spook them it will be a perfekt distraction and we can circle right behind those buildings and strike at the guards controlling the opening and closing of the gate. It is all managed from above where they can spot any who arrives and open and shut it. The stairs are narrow so once taken we should be able to hold it - for a while.\" Homura said and looked to Akagi. \"Perhaps a well placed fire arrow in the haystack right besides the horses might bring things to happen?\" Homura suggested implying Akagai might have the better archers of the two.

The sweet smell was more pronounced and even as she breathed he felt the warmth across his chest along with the heat from her palms - it made him forget about the pain for a while and even if it didn't work he wasn't going to stop her. \"Wh-what are you doing..?\" he however asked, but the real question was not about the breathing but the odd golden aura that emanated from her body.

Shogo Urabe had noticed Kojuro walk by, then stop. Obviously he wasn\u2019t brimming with enthusiasm to rejoin the party and Shogo didn\u2019t blame him.

They were all sat cross-legged on the ground with a few bottles between them. Despite the booze none of the solemn warriors seemed to be taken in by the party atmosphere. Shogo poured a cup for Kojuro. Nobody seemed to be expecting him to make conversation, which was a relief.

Both Empires.\u201d His gaze that had been turned towards the stars and visions of his late master now fixed itself with great intensity upon Kojuro. \u201cLord Kojuro, I intend to protect his legacy.\u201d His words seemed heavy with loaded meaning.\u201cThank you, Shogo-dono,\u201d Kojuro said, giving a small smile, \u201cOf course you will.\u201d He had been meaning to say more but a servant had quietly approached from the house and was waiting to be acknowledged.

He was a bizarre sight as he stood stock still in Wuppo's grasp, raised and then lowered over the side of the wall. The ogre dropped him very gently and he landed on his feet. He staggered a bit to regain his footing, drunk as he was. He looked up: the wall rose above him. He would need to walk around to the gate and request re-entry. But something else caught his eye too. A figure leaning against the wall, very casually, yet nonetheless, it seemed odd. \u201cYou there!\u201d he said gruffly, putting his hand on the hilt of his short sword, hoping to attract the person's attention.

Ultimately Yasuke followed Kojuro back inside instead of sneaking after the sake immediately. Having the huge ogre follow them inside, squeezing himself in, was an oddly casual thing and Yasuke caught himself wondering if other samurai clans had to contend with the same amount of odd stuff he was experiencing. Probably not, he thought, seeing the ogre stepping through the mess the drunken bastard and himself had already made.Yasuke made his way over to Tsukimi's side, his breath held just shortly as he considered if it was a thing he could get away with, but opted to continue as she looked concerned. Putting his hand on Tsukimi's shoulder Yasuke would try and speak as gently as possible. \"Are you okay, Tsukimi? That man was very rude.\" he said, right before Kojuro also spoke to Tsukimi, Yasuke opening his eyes wide. \"W-what..? Did he propose to you? When?\" Yasuke asked surprised and frowned, although suddenly that name rang a bell. \"Urabe... Is that Shigu Urabe, one of your generals..?!?\" he turned Kojuro, having forgotten his exact given name, as his mind slowly starting to process the fact, that he had attacked a general. This could potentially be very bad, but Kojuro seemed oddly calm.\"Hizashi-dono... with all due respect, what is going on here?\" he looked to Kojuro and then back at Tsukimi - even casting his gaze at Wuppo, feeling like everyone in this room knew more than him.

She wondered if they brought him in for purposes of intimidation. In that sense, it worked, but only because her bow has been confiscated upon entry. \"I am very sorry for the trouble, Hizashi-Dono.
