The snake pit is however not a run down shack and you'll be met by a rather well dressed people from the doorman to the lovely ladies serving you your drink. But don't make the mistake that the sweet ladies behind the bar is in any way for sale being fully fletched members of the Orchard Viper Triads and readily able to handle themselves. Culture inside The Snake Pit is classy but relaxed and the style is a lovely blend of chinese and japanese traditions and is designed to make you feel comfy. However the true attraction at The Snake Pit is not the quality sake served at daytime - which would otherwise be quite the reason to come by - but rather it's the back room where the mood gets slightly more 'lively' at night. Here the ones approved to enter are led into a large room with another bar, cosy places to sit - and a square area more or less in the middle which is lowered a couple of feet. \u00a0Here contestants are able to duke it out in the old way with fists, elbows, knees and... well whatever natural weapon nature has given you to your disposal as a human being. And if you aren't human? Well who don't enjoy seeing an unpredictable match? However magic in any form is strictly forbidden along with eye clawing and groin kicking and the referee is the one who decides when the fight is over. You can fight in the pit by signing up as a fighter hoping to win a bit of gold betting on your own victory... which is definitely better than the poor fools being forced to fight there owing too much money to the Triads. One thing is for sure though, if anything happens in the criminal underworld of Jeoncho, it likely all started here - and the money goes this way too. And a word of advice? Just keep smiling and enjoy being their guest while not asking too many annoying questions. Then you'll do just fine. However this is also the place to go to, if you need the services of these particular 'moral free' types that make out most of the Orchard Viper Triads.\u00a0Orchard Viper Triads' insignia", "link_list": ["https://flic.kr/p/24t2sWZ", "https://flic.kr/p/24t2sWZ", "https://www.flickr.com/photos/137813549@N06/", "https://flic.kr/p/24t2taV", "https://flic.kr/p/24t2taV", "https://www.flickr.com/photos/137813549@N06/", "https://flic.kr/p/24KaRj1", "https://flic.kr/p/24KaRj1", "https://www.flickr.com/photos/137813549@N06/"], "image_list": ["https://farm1.staticflickr.com/900/40343594005_a6e900d477.jpg", "https://farm1.staticflickr.com/877/40343594755_05053e2b65_z.jpg", "https://farm1.staticflickr.com/815/40526294064_f72398b25e_z.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><font size=\"6\">The Snake Pit\u00a0</font></div>"}, "post-81819": {"user": "Renzo Uehara", "user_num": 2976, "timestamp": "1524069687000", "message": "Renzo lounged by the bar at the back of the first public room of the Snake Pit.

He was extravagant, pretentious and cost the same as three equally skilled henchmen. But he was worth the cost. Not only was he brutally effective, but he also didn't have that danger instinct to limit him - he just did what had to be done. No more and no less.

You better let me handle the numbers, because I did not promise you one hundred ryo, I bet ten ryo on your behalf and you'd get it back five times minus the debt you still have with interests. But don't worry about that, there is still a healthy plus on your side, so please do enjoy yourself until I get the calculations done.\" Yakumo said and smiled bowing just slightly to Torakichi before turning and leaving. This way was not perfect, because he would still be a nuisance and use up food and drinks and as he was out of earshot and turned to one of his henchmen. \"You know that ming-looking vase we have out back... please grease it slightly and fill it with sake so that one can only just carry it - and give it to good old Tora-san over there as a congratulations-gift.\" he smirked as the henchman smirked back knowingly. \"I'll see it done, Yakumo-sama...\" he said and discretely headed towards the back room.

He wanted to just throw him out on his butt and be done with it, since he had been so much trouble, but in the end had had actually been some help to Fubiyoku-san in doing a few jobs and stuff. Looking at Torakichi Yakumo didn't imagine he was a guy who was too strong with the numbers, and if he, say, overshot his limit, he would be working for Yakumo again.
