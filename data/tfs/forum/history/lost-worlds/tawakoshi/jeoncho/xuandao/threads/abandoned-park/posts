It took class to pull off such a bold combination, something this man clearly lacked as stood humbly in his dilapidated rice straw hat. Was that a chain at his waist? He would have to be most confident in his ability to use that as a weapon. His hair, long and straggly, was a sign he had not been exaggerating about his time on the road.

The mask was supposed to be jade, was it not? Renzo pulled the mask slowly free from the cloth bag, and in his hands, Hitsufune would see the artefact transformed. No longer did it seem to be formed of the milky green stone as he would have seen it in the treasure store of the Kuzuyama clan, but rather it seemed covered in soft plumage that was iridescent with red and gold hues as Renzo ran his fingers over it. The beak was elegantly curved, sharp and proud. The empty eye holes seemed to regard Renzo with mocking challenge.

He felt himself drawn suddenly and impossibly into a whirlpool of memories.

And then, the dead lord. The child. The flight. The castle roof. The way blinded by tears from smoke. A temple garden. A turning away. How, how did it know these things? He reached up with both hands and wrenched the mask from his face, finding himself on his knees and panting as he threw it to the ground.

Can't you feel it? The kinship of the masks?\" Yakumo said as his grin widened. \"Surely they belong together don't they? After all they were made to stand side by side and protect the jade emperor.\" Yakumo said, though he had to admit that though he wanted the masks to be brought back together he had no idea as to what end. And if snake knew he hadn't let Yakumo in on it yet. \".. or rain havoc on the jade emperors enemies.\" Yakumo said and chuckled. \"But I have a feeling that the jade masks were created for something else than just obtaining powerful warriors, and I have a deep wish to see exactly what that is.\" Yakumo added and once again caught himself studying Renzo and wondered if these masks were indeed man's best shot at eclipsing the gods?Yakumo laughed along with Renzo. There was never anything as relieving as a good laugh after seeing the painful fall of an enemy. Speaking of which it seemed like Hitsufune had given up and fainted. Surely one who couldn't even challenge Renzo in a fair fight was no match for Renzo with the rooster mask on and he let our a chuckle before turning his attention back to Renzo. \"Well Fenghuang and Renzo, you should get to know each other better, but I think our business has been concluded here.\" Yakumo said and nodded towards Hitsufune. \"Untie him and leave him be. He was too weak to do anything and I bet his will is broken now if Fenghuang did his job properly.\" Yakumo said and looked at Renzo with eyes and voice seemingly transforming for a short moment, making it hard to judge if the last part was spoken from Yakumo or snake.

He gave a small bow when Yakumo suggested they get to know each other better. Fenghuang was had started to flash visions at him in response to Yakumo\u2019s words, too many and took quickly for Renzo to make sense of them. \u201cYes, we will \u2026 later. This is enough for now,\u201d he put his hands to the side of the mask and tried to pull it off, but Fenghuang was resistant. \u201cEnough, Fenghuang!\u201d he commanded it, and after some resistance the mask replied simply, You will learn, and came free of its own accord after Renzo had stopped wrenching at it. Holding it in his hands, he looked around at a world more drab and colourless than it had been. Yakumo once more appeared human to his eyes. Grey clouds slowly made their way across the sky, while the leaves and grass underfoot seemed more black than green. He picked up the bag that the mask had been carried in, and placed it inside. It certainly needed a better dwelling place than this thief\u2019s sack, but for now he tied it to his belt and went to rescue Tsujikaze from the tree, pulling the blades free and unwinding the chain, letting Hitsufune\u2019s body slump to the ground. As he pushed the blades of the kusarigama back into their handles, he regarded the unconscious figure coolly. He had thought Yakumo had needed him alive for some purpose, but apparently not. Renzo himself had no reason to suggest an alternative, the man meant less than nothing to him. However, he did pick up the ronin\u2019s kusarigama and threw it into a bush. \u201cYes, let us return. I look forward to hearing more about your philosophy, Yakumo-sama.\u201d ", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Renzo could feel the connection between the masks, that they resonated together like instruments playing in harmony, but he had no intention of telling Yakumo exactly what he felt.
