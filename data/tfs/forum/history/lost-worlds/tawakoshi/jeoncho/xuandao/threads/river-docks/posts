Those docking here can obtain passes at the Port Office. Most of the docks are formed of wooden pilings, although the Emperor's Pleasure Boat and Shogun's Warship are moored at sturdier stone docks. These two vessels are rarely used, but heavily guarded by samurai. Tea houses nearby have a great view of these magnificent vessels for tourists.The docks are busy, with fishing vessels, trade vessels, ferries and pleasure boats. There is a lively fish market, which lends a distinctive aroma to the area when the wind blows in certain directions. Citizens of all walks of life carry on their business here in efficient chaos.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "A busy riverside area where there is docking for river-going ships large and small, as well as wharves and barracks and guard posts for Xuandao's city guard.
