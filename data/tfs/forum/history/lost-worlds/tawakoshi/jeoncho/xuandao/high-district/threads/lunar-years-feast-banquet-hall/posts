All invitees are welcome to bring a plus one.) with their family crested stamped to the invitation, as well as details on the back of where the feast will be and at what time to arrive. Those without an invitation will not be allowed within. The banquet hall can feed hundreds of people. Ky has decorated the large banquet rooms with red lanterns as well as rat themed wall decor. There are also red envelopes of fortune at each long table for the guests. He has even chosen to find musicians playing traditional instruments to reflect the mood of the night.
