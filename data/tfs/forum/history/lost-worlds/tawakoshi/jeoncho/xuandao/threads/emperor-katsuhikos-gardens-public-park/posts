Here you may pray or simply find peace from the turmoil of everyday life.\u00a0Entry into Emperor Katsuhiko's Gardens is allowed for anyone but if you are not presentable or showing decent civilized behavior, you may be directed out of the park by the patrolling samurai guards - who otherwise only are discretely present for the lord's and lady's safety and comfort.Use of the Gardens span both romantic walks, rehabilitation, socializing, picnic and any easy pastime you might think of that won't disturb your fellow citizen and will honor the Emperor's name and intentions with this park.\u00a0Below are various locations of interest that you're likely to encounter when taking a stroll around the park.\u00a0\u00a0____________________________________________________________________________________The inner zen garden and Kami ShrineIf you do not find peace or harmony here, it's not likely any place in Xuandao will satisfy your quest for inner peace. The central position of the park and the walls that separate the place from the rest of the park makes for a secluded retreat and an utterly tranquil experience for the one searching to commune with the Kami and learn about one's own Tao. The monks here will assist you in any way they can.Sakura BridgeHere you will arguably find the most romantic and beautiful view in all of the Emperor's Gardens. This place was made from the emperor's specific wishes and cherry trees and flowers have been brought in from all over Tawakoshi. When he was married it happened on this very bridge. However should you wish for a more secluded romantic picnic or steal a kiss from your beloved, the trees make several small, natural groves where one can talk undisturbed.\u00a0Lake of The Three StarsIf the lake wasn't a pleasurable view in the daytime it certainly becomes in the night where paper lanterns in various color not only illuminate the roads but often the lake and sky too when lanterns are put into the lake and released into the sky to make a fantastic night time spectacle. The leading artists of Xuandao also often come here to paint the picturesque landscape and even exhibit their creations to any interested bystanders.\u00a0", "link_list": ["https://flic.kr/p/JwxUsW", "https://flic.kr/p/JwxUsW", "https://www.flickr.com/photos/137813549@N06/", "https://flic.kr/p/JwK4iE", "https://flic.kr/p/JwK4iE", "https://www.flickr.com/photos/137813549@N06/", "https://flic.kr/p/JwxUcL", "https://flic.kr/p/JwxUcL", "https://www.flickr.com/photos/137813549@N06/", "https://flic.kr/p/JwxUwd", "https://flic.kr/p/JwxUwd", "https://www.flickr.com/photos/137813549@N06/", "https://flic.kr/p/JwxUsW", "https://flic.kr/p/JwxUsW", "https://www.flickr.com/photos/137813549@N06/"], "image_list": ["https://farm1.staticflickr.com/905/27912704098_a488a23abc_o.jpg", "https://farm1.staticflickr.com/864/27914880068_a91e855038_o.jpg", "https://farm1.staticflickr.com/910/27912703218_49d65e6948.jpg", "https://farm1.staticflickr.com/907/27912704288_b25211c503_z.jpg", "https://farm1.staticflickr.com/905/27912704098_b8d8911f5f_z.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><font size=\"7\">Emperor Katsuhiko's Gardens</font><br>____________________________________________________________________<br/><br/><a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/JwxUsW\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/905/27912704098_a488a23abc_o.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/></a><a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/JwxUsW\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/137813549@N06/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><br/><br/><font size=\"5\">The current emperor Katsuhiko of Tawakoshi have gifted this park to the citizens of Xuandao along with a beautiful zen shrine in honor of the kami in the center of the park.
