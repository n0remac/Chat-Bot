Patrolled night and day by elite court guards, the boat has remained unused and empty for many years. While the Emperor and his family are confined to the palace by order of the Shogun, the Pleasure Boat is nothing more than a sad but beautiful relic of bygone days. It is kept in immaculate condition, with gilded woodwork and fresh paper lanterns, yet never sails.

His black eyes shone with a fervid intensity. Like her, he was a patriot. All the guards aboard this boat were loyal to the Emperor and his family. They had been placed here specifically to keep them out of the way of the Shogun\u2019s business. It was a high honour to guard the Emperor\u2019s own floating palace, but there was little one could do here to meddle in politics or in war. So the Shogun thought, anyway, but he was a base and small-minded man, lacking in imagination. Kiri felt the bond of loyalty that wove between her and the guard she followed, between all the men here. It was a web that would not be broken merely by the three generations of Ogino shoguns, stretching back hundreds of years, even to the days of the Jade Emperor. A smile began to curl the edge of her lip. Yes, she had the backing of the Emperor\u2019s court, and had long been whispering in the right places, but there were places she could not reach \u2013 either as O-Kiri-hime or as Kiri Hizashi. That was where this meeting came in. The interior of the boat held many elaborate rooms both above and below deck. Spaces for entertaining, sleeping, eating, dancing, and everything in between.  Kiri could only imagine what they must have been like in the days when they were used, but she felt certain she would see them brought to life again. She lifted the hem of her robes and swished down dark wooden stairs into the bowels of the vessel where light from the candles would not be seen from outside. The small room had only one visible entrance. Gilded screens that featured paintings of flag irises, reflected the soft glow from the lanterns. There were only two cushions to sit on, though both were of fine brocade and a luxurious height. Her maidservant, practically invisible in dark robes against the black of night, would remain outside the door, unless required. One of the san\u2019in, she was a very discreet assassin who would make certain of Kiri\u2019s safety when she met alone with the silk merchant Yakumo Teiko. At this moment, the girl was talking softly to one of the guards, and Kiri paced the perimeter of the room. Just before she heard that Yakumo Teiko was arriving, she sat herself on the cushion at the head of the room and awaited her guest.

He made a living selling luxury and as such he appreciated quality when he saw it and this was indeed quality - probably the finest ship in all of Tawakoshi. Although one would need to consider the immaculately built boats of Quying too though their quality was usually more in the realms of speed, maneuverability and sturdiness. No this ship was a gem no doubt and he took a deep breath and sighed as he thought the lady who had invited him couldn't possess a half bad taste when proposing a meeting in that beauty. Yakumo had received a note from a servant inviting him on board of the emperor's ship and usually not a fan of bad jokes he almost had her dragged to the local brothel to have a taste of taste of what a real joke was like. Luckily she had a quite sincere expression and Yakumo chose to believe her long enough to read the note. However the note revealed little but the fact it was a 'she' he was going to meet - and on the emperor's pleasure boat of all places. Yakumo might have tried to dig a little deeper into who this person was, but decided that his time and resources were too precious and also kinda looked forward to the having the suspense released when they would actually meet. Approaching the ship Yakumo bowed to one of the guards that stood before the ramp. \"I have been invited to meet a lady on board this ship - although I might have been fooled by a prankster.\" he said to the guard and it was with some surprise he was let through and allowed to enter onto the boat. Yakumo did not hurry in the slightest but enjoyed ascending the brilliantly made ship and noticed and appreciated all the little details that was put into the making of the boat. Yakumo was then lead down into the ship's deeper levels and apparently the one he was meeting was quite the careful person. Seeing the servant outside the door he stopped and gave her a smile and a curious glance. Not because he wanted to in particular, but the snake had taken an interest in the servant it seemed. \"She is interesting... Quick and dangerous - almost like the snake you know, Yakumo-san.\" it told him as Yakumo's smile broadened in acknowledgement of the snake's observation, though people around him less observant would probably see it as a pleasant and polite smile. She might be worth keeping a keen eye on, should something 'unexpected' happen, Yakumo noted.\"I am Yakumo Teiko - a humble silk merchant. If I'm not wrong I am expected by the mysterious lady behind these doors - at least that excuse worked with the guards on deck.\" he joked and and chuckled slightly. In the case he was let in he would humbly bow to the servant and enter inside the room Kiri had been waiting in. Lanterns had been lit and softly illuminated the exquisite paintings on the walls. Perhaps this was where the emperor stayed normally?Yakumo bowed and kept his wide smile standing before Kiri.\"Good evening my lady, I am Yakumo Teiko. Do you wish to purchase some of my fine silk to add to your ship's collection - or do you wish to browse some of our other 'products'?\" Yakumo asked jestingly, knowing full well that she wasn't the emperor - but perhaps she sought the position?", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "With his hands folded before him in his usual way and his face folded with a slight smile - in his usual way - he approached the emperor's pleasure boat with small steps his pace only interrupted to stop and look at the marvelous ship.
