Without further event, they had travelled the rest of the way through the forest and truned south, north of Xuandao, out onto the open plain of Kusahara that Kojuro and his advisors had chosen as the best spot to engage the Shogunate in battle.  The first rays of morning light cleared the distant hills and revealed the misty scene, banners were raised high in the air, colours still muted in the dawn. The battlefield sloped downwards towards the city, and the command centre was placed on a high spot, somewhere behind the main fighting units. Tent-like curtains were raised around it, and inside the daimyo would normally take an overview of the battle, receive messengers and send out orders. His personal guard including Yasuke Shisou and Wuppo would remain nearby. At the moment, the commander's stool, draped in a bearskin, stood empty as Kojuro stood outside, surveying the army laid out before him with an eerie calm. Everything was quiet except for the creak of armour, the flap of the banners and the occasional whinnying of horses. The army was arranged in an arrowhead formation. Archers at the front would open fire to begin the combat, then a sharp point of samurai cavalry would bear down upon the Shogun's army, creating an opening in their forces, while spearmen would guard the flanks. The experienced general Katsutora Ikeda, a relative on Kojuro's mother's side had been chosen to lead the samurai charge. As well as fighting for both the current and former shogun, most recently he had led the Hizashi forces to occupy Sarisu Island. His daughter, Tsuru Ikeda, was commanding the units of foot-soldier archers. Her recent campaigns had involved ridding Kiyonai of ronin and bandits, as well as pushing Kiyonai's borders with Jeoncho.The spearmen were commanded by Shogo Urabe, a veteran of Lord Genji's long campaign in Katashima. Extremely loyal to Genji, he was one of his closest supporters. A rearguard of mounted samurai, plus archers and spearmen were also behind the command centre. That was the plan, anyway, but formations rarely lasted too long in samurai warfare, as far as Kojuro had ascertained. Individuals seeking glory would abandon a formation to search out duels with men of equal or greater rank on the other side, while the footsoldiers would end up in more or less a huge melee. Still, it was difficult to know what to expect for his first pitched battle and being over-prepared made more sense than just trying to wing it. At least it looks like we know what we're doing, he had to admit to himself. Everything was very well turned out. Despite spending the entire journey worrying about the battle, now he was actually here in the moment, he felt oddly calm. Everything was in the hands of the gods now. All he had to do was wait for the signal that the enemy was approaching. \u201cReady?\u201d he half-turned to his two companions and nodded, but his focus was still on the south, looking for movement or colour that meant the Shogunate was about to arrive.

Feeling he would be more manoeuvrable on foot, he urged his horse on into a group of soldiers, and dismounted, running at odds to the direction the horse went, letting it serve as a distraction. His whirling kusarigamas became a blur, sharpened by the Fenghuang to a level no master swordsmith could achieve, and, as he went, trailing fire. The chains burned where they caught a man\u2019s limb, and the sickles seemed to slice through armour as though melting it as they passed. Hizashi men cried out and fell before him as he sliced a swathe through them. No soldier of the Hizashi managed to get close to touching Renzo, and when the amassed troops became too solid for him to fight his way through, Fenghuang\u2019s power let him leap from a horseback here to a jutting rock here, as he darted over them, heading towards the ogre, evading the spears and arrows as he went, fire and sparks spitting out behind him. defence:\u00a0rblqgqdO1-20attack:\u00a01-201-20\u00b71-20", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Magic\u2026 it seemed no matter how many times he told the Shogun that his abilities were skill alone, that word kept rearing its ugly head.

Wuppo's burns from Renzo and being slashed by the now deceased Joji were significant injuries, but they would have to be far more grave than they were to take the ogre out of the fight.

Wuppo's current state of mind didn't allow him to process well what his friend was yelling over the battle going on around them, but he did understand 'Kojuro'. Wuppo snapped his head to his left, looking over to where Kojuro had been. Wuppo saw the ornament on Kojuro's helmet - the dragonfly symbol the ogre would know anywhere - as it fell to the ground. The ogre was seeing red as the realization came over him that Kojuro could have been harmed while he had his back turned, fighting Joji and then Renzo. Wuppo cared so precious little about honor, or fighting Renzo, or even about the Hizashi Clan in general. He'd only come to protect his friend, and a new, empowering rage swept over him as it appeared he may have failed without even realizing it.Wuppo bounded towards where Kojuro had fallen, leaving Renzo behind. It took the ogre only a handful of strides to reach Kojuro's attacker, blindly bowling over or bashing anyone in his path.

He approached General Oguro, in the ogre\u2019s strong grasp and disarmed. He pointed his sword towards Suezo as he addressed him. \u201cGeneral. It seems you now have a choice. Do you want the chance to see the world with open eyes? If you and your men surrender now, I guarantee you will see it.

If Renzo was right, why didn\u2019t Suezo just kill Hizashi? This wasn\u2019t merely a battle of strength but a battle of ideals. Loyalty and honour, or justice and wisdom. Hizashi\u2019s underlings were right, this really was more interesting than fighting him. It\u2019s all ridiculous, he thought to himself, sneering. But in the end, he couldn\u2019t look away. My eyes are open and I serve anyway, for far less reason than Oguro Suezo does, Renzo considered, sharing his thoughts with the spirit of the mask that burned brightly somewhere within, and yet apart from, his own consciousness. He had agreed to do the Shogun\u2019s bidding for a large quantity of gold, and quite some status as a favoured hunting dog, and no principle meant as much to a hired mercenary as a contract. Yet Yakumo-san had talked of changing the fate of Tawakoshi. It was something he had scoffed at, at the time. But now, perhaps the tides were turning. A victory for the Hizashi would mean a change of the nation\u2019s fate, and one change was often the catalyst for others. The voice of Fenghuang rose like a pillar of fire in his mind. Under a new regime, you can get justice for the Takenouchi and restoration for Matasaburo! Is that not what you truly want? Renzo pressed his lips into a thin line. Although he wanted to deny it he found himself somewhat rooting for the Hizashi. With Suezo seized in the grasp of the ogre, Renzo stood and looked around. Down below, the Hizashi were gaining ground on the Shogun\u2019s troops. He turned back and listened to Hizashi give his ultimatum. A contract means nothing, if the one who signed it is dead. The thought came from neither Fenghuang nor himself, but from both. What use was the power of the mask if it was tied down to the ravings of a madman? He felt the mask\u2019s fiery power flow through him once more. He knew what he had to do, and it was not to fight and die on the losing side. Nor was it to surrender and be taken captive like a common criminal. He stepped out, trailing flame and sparks from the sides of the mask. \u201cI am not yours to command, General Oguro. Only one person currently has that privilege, and not for long. Perhaps I will see you in the capital, Lord Hizashi.\u201d Renzo gave a bow to both, and then, with renewed speed, he was gone in flash, leaping over and between the combatants and the melee until he disappeared in the direction of the capital city.
