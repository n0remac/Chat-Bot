An experienced warrior with many battles under his belt in Katashima, Kumagai was pleased to be able to use his expertise here. Five years of relative peace under Genji's rule in Kiyonai had chafed him, loyal as he was, and manning the Kasen no Tochi fortress had not exactly stretched him. Once the fortress had been razed to the ground, they would make camp here and await the Shogun's men. He stroked his beard, surveying the handiwork of warriors. Yes, let them come. We are ready.

Yeah right, as if they would bother burning down some small guard post in the southern region of Jeoncho - or dare do such a thing.' general Noritoshi thought leading his army of samurai south. After all their intelligence told them that the Hizashi leaders Genji and Kojuro were both on death's door with only the pacifistic Ryuzo Hizashi to take the reins. Well even though the shogun had been absolutely furious about it, and ordered a large force of his good men to deal with the supposed Hizashi attack, the general didn't believe it himself. As a general - and especially as a general of the shogunate - it was his duty to remain focused and rational in these situations. He knew that bandits often roamed these parts and speculated that it might have been a large group who were trying to prove a point. Well, if that was the case the bandits were in for a very bad time. The shogun had bought the story the fleeing soldiers had told him - and then executed them for being cowards - but more importantly it meant that this was no mere peasant army Noritoshi carried with him. It would have taken too long to mobilize them anyway, and instead the clans related to Jeoncho were rallied and asked to contribute with a considerable amount of soldiers immediately. And of course they did, as no one wants to be on the bad side of the shogun. As they neared the attacked fortress the general didn't really expect there to be anyone left, but to his huge surprise Hizashi banners waved in the air as they had camped at the fortress. But even though anger grew in general Noritoshi's heart, he hadn't been promoted to general without a certain level of reason too. What if this was some setup by a party that hoped for war between Hizashi and the shogunate? What if they were bandits clad in Hizashi armor? In any case he wanted to know the intention of these people, and besides the army camped there looked relatively small compared to his own. General Noritoshi signaled his forces to split into three. One third to follow him and the last two thirds to split up and slightly flank the culprits. \"Who are you and what on earth are you doing decimating this fortress? Are you trying to ruin our peace!?! I must speak to your leader at once!\" Noritoshi said as he approached the camped forces with the shogun's banner waving from his spear. Even if it were genuine Hizashi troops, perhaps reason would dissuade them of this foolish plan.

For all that this was an ambush, Kumagai\u2019s samurai fought with spear, bow and sword, not a cowardly weapon like poison. Fumitori\u2019s men gave a good account of themselves, but the inukuma, the terrain, and the element of surprise were not to their advantage. Fumitori\u2019s men were nearly all dead or wounded, those few that survived running after shadows into the woods, but the Hizashi side were not without some casualties either.It was not long before the rest of the Shogun\u2019s army followed them in. The fighting was brief as, just as they had planned, the Hizashi forces moved back into cover of the trees, inciting the Shogun\u2019s forces to follow, and be led deep into the woods to die or else wander for a time, lost and unable to find an opponent to fight, only hearing the rattle of armour or seeing light reflected from a blade in the darkness. However, Kumagai did not see Noritoshi\u2019s banner. One of his men finished up bandaging the arrow wound to Kumagai\u2019s thigh, and he assembled the force who had followed him through the pass. His watchers in the woods could take the rest of Noritoshi\u2019s army. Kumagai and his assembled men rode swiftly through paths that the San\u2019in had scouted for them before, around the hills, through the less dense areas of woodland, before breaking out of the treeline some distance towards the east of Noritoshi\u2019s small guard force. Kumagai and his men rode around Noritoshi and his men, encircling the small band who had remained outside the woods. \u201cGeneral Noritoshi! Surrender now or fight to the death!\u201d Kumagai called in his deep and resonant voice. There was not much in the way of good choices for the general now, separated from his main force and surrounded. Of course, he could try to make a run for it into the forest\u2026 ", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Kumagai had climbed to a higher vantage, and watched as he saw Noritoshi\u2019s lieutenant, Fumitori suddenly fall from his horse.

Yeah, that's what he would tell the shogun once these traitors were dead, that some ronin among the Hizashi had grown frustrated and attacked Sugimoto Fortress but that he was certain this treachery wasn't supported by the main Hizashi branch. There was no reason to call upon war, especially now that his daughter was going to be married next month - peace would be the best for all parts and he was sorry that it had to end this violently for Kumagai even though he was the one provocating. As he heard the fighting dying out Notirtoshi expected a messenger to return from his army and inform him of the status - but as the minutes passed and no messenger arrived Noritoshi grew increasingly more impatient and something inside him started doubting - started imagining what if they had actually went into a trap. Were the Hizashi actually orchestrating a large scale offense?\"Turn around, we'll withdraw from the forest for now.\" Noritoshi commanded and any voice that doubted Noritoshi's orders were quickly hushed. However Noritoshi and his small band of remaining soldiers and personal guard did not get long before the thundering sound of horses were heard from both sides and he realized that he had essentially missed his opportunity for flight and found himself flanked and quickly surrounded. Noritoshi gave Kumagai a reluctant smile - he had certainly outsmarted Noritoshi, though he was in no mood for applauding Kumagai's tactics right now. \"You can quit the performance now, Kumagai.\" Noritoshi said. \"So this is going to happen, the Hizashi riding for Xuandao?\" he said and slowly shook his head looking down. \"That's the worst possible timing Kumagai. Not that I condone war by any means, but my daughter is getting married next month and I don't fancy dying either here or in a prison in Kiyonai.\" he said with a faint wry smile. \"How about you'll let me ride alone? My clan is west of here and I'll ride back to be with my family - rest assured I have no intention in rejoining this bloodbath.\" he said and looked at Kumagai waiting to see what kind of man would respond to his plea.
