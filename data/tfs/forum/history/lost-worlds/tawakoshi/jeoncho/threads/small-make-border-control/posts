As for Grandma and Zu Fu, the old shaman had gently suggested that they'd go so the girl would not remember too much from what happened, and as such they continued towards the city. Tea was the next goal, and to their luck the small town had a very decent looking tea shop that sold a bit of ramen too. The sight of it only had Zu Fu's feet all excited as he picked up the pace. \"Come on, you wanted tea right?

We have the finest tea in east Jeoncho.

Offering a polite nod to who Grandma presumed made the tea, she followed Zu Fu\u2019s lead, taking a cautious sip of the dragon tea. Given the topic Grandma had just brought up, it seemed fitting to drink this one first.\u201cYour presence is rather distinct, Zu Fu. If these dragons are as spiritually attuned as you make them out to be, it doesn\u2019t surprise me at all that the dragon was startled by your arrival. You\u2019d be quite the menace if you weren\u2019t so laid back. The people of Tawakoshi are very fortunate one as hospitable as yourself controls such power.\u201d Grandma\u2019s voice was more serious than normal, the old woman directing a knowing look towards Zu Fu. Deciding to move on to the next cup, Grandma raised the bamboo tea to her lips, sniffing at it a moment before taking a sip.\u201cYou flatter me, but you hardly need my presence to awake the dragons. I suspect I\u2019m simply along for the ride because you worry what type of trouble I might get into should I be left unsupervised.\u201d Shaking her head with a chuckle, she took another sip of the bamboo tea. It certainly had a unique flavor\u2026 She wasn\u2019t sure if she actually liked the flavor, but she did like new experiences and this tea certainly qualified as one.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Grandma seemed slightly amused by the waitress' outburst about Isra having a \u201ckitsune\u201d as Empress.

For all I know they only work in accordance with the flow of all things, and if you stat getting selfish you'll disrupt this very flow.\" he said and shook his head. \"Even if such powers can be corrupted I know far too much about corruption to ever find that it could make me a tempting offer.\" Zu Fu said and sipped also to the bamboo tea which he found very delicious. \"The flavor is good right?\" he smiled at Grandma having listened to her deduct what might be another part of the truth. \"Indeed I wanted to introduce you to the Tawakoshi customs in the right way - but fate has not brought you along with me idly and though it might seem like that to you, I'm sure your presence will be meaningful in regards to the end goal - though it has not been revealed to me how, yet.\" he said and sniffed the the black tea. \"I feel as if my energy is already being restored.\" Zu Fu put the cup to his lips with joy. \"Tell me please, what do you like to do when you want to relax and decouple from work and stress?
