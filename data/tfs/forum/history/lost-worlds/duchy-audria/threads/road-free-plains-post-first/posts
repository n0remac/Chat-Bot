While most people have a monologue in their heads, Reiea has a strange dialogue in her mind between her \"conscious,\" which is her unrestrained, everyday thought, and her \"conscience,\" which is her inner moral compass \u2013 her conscience.These two parts of her mind struggle, tease, and argue with each other throughout most of her experiences, giving more inner tension and stress (sometimes humorously) to an already strained girl: her reason for being out here is to find a man whom she loves, who has never reciprocated her love for him.She is probably very full of hormones. In the modern age, she would likely be prescribed medication to suppress the battle between conscious and conscience, or if the battle wore her on for too long, an antidepressant.But I digress. Let us return to Reiea.The sun, the butterflies, the grass... I could stay out here, conscious wistfully said, as Reiea smiled and viewed the countryside. So different from Asgeir. Who knew the world had so much to offer?Conscience resisted telling her other half \"I told you so,\" and merely assented, Yeah. It's a pretty landscape. Kinda flat, next to Asgeir, definitely way grassier.\u00a0It's cool to see the world. Maybe after we find him, we can just explore together. See sand, and grass, and oceans, and snow, and hills...Hah. Don't get your hopes up, conscious warned. Remember how the guy never cared?Oh, come on. Who can't enjoy seeing the world?Reiea continued to the Free Plains.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Reiea made her way down the road to Salem, thinking to herself about the contrast between these grassy plains and Asgeir's mountain ranges."}, "post-35242": {"user": "Klearia", "user_num": 64, "timestamp": "1461805055000", "message": "Soft footsteps down the road heralded the arrival of a lone female battlemage, her appearance slightly foreign and of Sakandian culture, though otherwise she seemed a normal traveler.

Now if you don't mind, I would like you to leave and keep on heading to Salem.\"  Rodrik offered a fake smile at the merchant and then ignored him.  The trader said a few words under his breath, but returned to his wagon and continued on his way.Rodrik shook his head.
