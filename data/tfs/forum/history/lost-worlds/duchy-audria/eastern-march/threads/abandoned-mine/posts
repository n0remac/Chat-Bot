Pretty sure this is the only spot on the whole river you can walk across.\"  The two would need to dismount and slowly lead their horses across the shallow part of the river.  \"During the fall and winter,\" he continued as they trudged along, \"lotta ice up north keeps the river shallow.  In the spring and summer the ice melts, more water flows.  If it gets cold enough, the entire river freezes, and the Brothers use them as highways.\"Once across, Volquin would begin to mount his horse but paused.  He slowly approached a muddy area and bent down, investigating.  \"Hmm... boot prints.  Not ours.\"  He looked around, suspicious-like.  \"Pagans,\" he cursed sharply.  \"Reckon we should be able to handle them.  Can't be but scouts or hunters, I am sure.\"  Unconcerned, he mounted his white horse and continued to lead the way to the mine.The mine was located in a depression at the summit of a large hill.  If not for the oaks and other trees, one might be able to see a good distance.  \"Brotherhood has plans for this spot.  Nice area to build a fort; clear view of the countryside; nearby river; plentiful game in the forests.\"Entering the depression, the entrance of the mine was hastily built and in a state of disrepair.  \"Hitch the horses here, we'll head inside.\"  Volquin untied his crossbow from the horse saddle, slung some bolts around his waist, and made sure his sword on him.  He then took a nearby torch and lit the faggot.  He nodded at Max to make sure he was ready and then lead the way into the dark, dank, and otherwise creepy mine.A cool air drifted from within.  An eerie, dark atmosphere that smelled of rot and decay invaded their nostrils.  It was unusually cold, with a airy ambient noise echoing from further in.  Wooden supports had cracked and broke, and parts of the mine was caved in, forcing the two to find alternate routs.  Mining tools and bones littered the ground in some places.  The warmth of the torch kept the cold touch of death from their skin.Proceeding cautiously, Volquin asked \"What kind of mercenary work do you usually find?\"", "link_list": ["/user/462"], "image_list": [], "html": "Volquin led "}, "post-53496": {"user": "max", "user_num": 462, "timestamp": "1476401171000", "message": "The roads were rough and the weather unkind.

Provided you pay more'' one could almost catch the hint of a smirk on the sell sword's face. They were closing in on the mine; crossing into the trail leading to the entrance of the abandoned structure. Horses were hitched and the cave dwellers took to their fit, Max bringing naught but his blade and cloak on their journey inside.Each step within the structure felt like the beating of war drums in the uneasy combination of the cold and quiet. Two torches illuminated the way forward when Volquin became inquisitive about the nature of Max's work.''Anything that pays well and doesn't include the whole sale slaughter of children. Occasionally, I monster hunt.

As they started to creep more into the cave, Volquin tried to be a little quieter.A rising gust of wind coming from within the cave could be heard as it howled through the crooked tunnel.  Suddenly Volquin's torch went out and they were introduced to pure darkness; there was no light.  It grew cold; in fact, it grew extremely cold... deathly cold.  The sound of wind was absent.\"Not good,\" Volquin said under his breath.  He fumbled around on his person, looking for flint to re-ignite the torch.  Then the sound of footsteps; slow, foreboding, footsteps.  The sound of metal scraping against the earth came next.  Volquin quit what he was doing, drew his blade, and tried to make out what was going on, but it was much to dark.And then faint blue lights could be seen ahead.  They were like eyes, peering at them through the darkness.  At first only two were visible, then four, then twelve - and more and more until dozens upon dozens of blue orbs could be seen in the distance.  It did not do much to help the visibility, but at least the two men knew where there enemy was.\"Draugr!\" Volquin cursed.  \"Take care not to slice a piece of my arm off,\" he half-joked.The blue eyes of the undead beings came closer and closer, with slow footsteps, and the sound of their weapons on the ground ceased - meaning they had lifted them.  The cave was not very wide, and only about five draugr could form a front line - with the rest behind them.  They suddenly let out a terrible screech and judging by the movements of their eyes they were bolting towards both men at great speeds...", "link_list": ["/user/462"], "image_list": [], "html": "Volquin looked at "}}
