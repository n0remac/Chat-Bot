Konrad was ready for the blow, and his endurance and reaction were paramount - easily discarding Vykas' blow and then disarming him.  Vykas fell upon his hands and knees in front of the Hochmeister.  That was it... his time was up.  He had tried to help his people and now he had failed.\"Go on... do it!\"  By now most of the Wickans eased back and combat seemed to grind to a sudden halt - both sides watching to see what would happen.  \"Kill me like you've killed my brothers... kill me!\"Konrad had the opportunity to land the killing blow.  To behead the ringleader and possibly destroy the alliances the Wickans had made.  Vykas' death would unravel all the oaths, all the promises, and would allow the Brothers to put an end to the conflict with one last stroke.  But that was not what Konrad had in mind.\"No.\"  The reply was cold and cut deep into every man there, all of whom expected the opposite.  Vykas' eyes clinched, anticipating his head rolling across the blood-soaked terrain.  But instead all he heard was a simple no.  Vykas slowly looked up, surprised, but with hate in his eyes.  \"No,\" Konrad reiterated, sheathing his sword, \"I shall not kill you, General Vykas.  That is not who I am.  The path forward is through forgiveness, not hate.\"  Konrad's words echoed through every man and woman on that killing field.  \"Tell your men to lay down their arms, for I do not wish for them to die by the sword.\"  In an act of mercy and compassion, Konrad held his right arm forward to help Vykas back up.  \"Help me bring peace to these lands... Brother...\"Vykas was silent, despite his heavy breathing.  He looked at his men, and then at the Knight-Brothers, and then at Konrad.  \"No.\"In another surprising act, Vykas aggressively grabbed Konrad's outstretched arm and pulled him forward - then drew a hidden dagger from his belt and plunged it into Konrad's gut.  It happened so fast that not even Konrad's superior reactions would stop it.Konrad grunted and instantly stumbled backward, clutching at the dagger still in his abdomen.  \"Master,\" Adrian and other Brothers hurriedly grabbed onto their Hochmeister to support him.  Roars erupted form both sides and another few seconds of combat ensued - but it would not last.Wickans had quickly pulled Vykas away from the conflict, into safety, throwing him upon a horse and riding away.  The Wickans exchanged their last few blows with the Brothers before turning and fleeing.  The Wickan forces had been broken and those who were not cut down attempted to flee southward.Through the gut-wrenching pain Konrad commanded \"Dietrich... we must... help Dietrich!\"The main force of Brothers began to charge southwest, towards Olvier's company.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<i>The Wickans, despite their fortifications, would lose the battle.

Fire on the demon!\"  At the Hochmeister's command, those Brothers who came armed with a bow briskly rushed to the river bank, firing in massed volleys at the demon, Gluttony; these were knights of nobility, and they had all been trained in archery since a young age, like all knights.
