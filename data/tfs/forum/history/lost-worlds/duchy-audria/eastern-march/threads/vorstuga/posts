Adrian squints his eyes as he peers out into the distance; nothing.  He may not see the enemy yet, but somewhere out there in the eastern forest they lurk under the cover of night.  It's a waiting game for the Brothers garrisoned here.\"Komtur,\" one of the Knights behind Adrian begins to speak up, but the commander doesn't look away from the forest.  \"Commander, why don't you get some rest?  We can keep watch for now.  You have a lot of work to do tomorrow, I am sure.\"Adrian sighs, not wanting to leave the post; ultimately, however, he gives in.  \"Sure,\" he mentions to his Knight-Brother, \"but if you see anything out there move, you give the signal, understood?\"\"Yes, Brother.\"Adrian nods and retreats down the trap door, down the ladder and into the interior of the tower.  He descends further, down into the lodgings to rest for the night.  The castle is kept warm thanks to a central heating room dug beneath the structure.  He closes his eyes and tries to run through all of the information.Scouts reported seeing movement in the Eastern March: large droves of soldiers making their way in waves towards Vorstuga.  There was no clear evidence yet as to whether it was Vykas and his Wickans again.  Once Hochmeister Konrad heard these reports, he immediately sent Adrian, Gustav, and Walther von Hohenstaufen with some other Knight-Brothers to reinforce the Vorstuga Garrison.  The Hochmeister also requested that  Grand Komtur: Giplor Vauc'Tutt send some of his marines who helped patrol and protect the Vorstuga River; the marines and the navy Giplor had brought proved to be invaluable in the Battle of the Vorstuga River, and that was much-needed help that Konrad could not thank Giplor enough for.  Others, like Silas who participated at the Battle of the Vorstuga River, were invited again - this time they'd receive a larger payment.  Perhaps the Land-Tiller's, the new allies of the Brothers, would send help as well.Whatever enemy the Brothers were facing this time waited specifically until the dead of winter.  At this time, the Vorstuga River was frozen over, and so the enemy forces could cross it if they were careful; this proved troublesome, as the Brothers' strategy involved bottlenecking the attackers on the bridge, where they could shoot them with their crossbows.  The eastern bank of the river which led into the Eastern March had been largely deforested, so it could act as a large battleground where cavalry could move now - but the main purpose was to allow the Brothers line of sight to the east.  The western bank, where the castle and the town was situated, was also largely deforested, with ample farmland that would allow armies to move freely - and trample much-needed crops if it wasn't winter.Marching troops in the dead of winter, however, was a bad idea, even the worst commander knows that.  Those who did not suffer a frozen death would be to tired and weak by the time they made it to Vorstuga; and with less game moving about in the woods, and the inability to forage, the opponent would need a ridiculous amount of supplies to trek all the way here.  It just didn't add up... something was definitely peculiar about this...In the early morning, Adrian once again toured and inspected the castle.  He had to make sure the walls were still strong, the throwers were in place, and the men were well-equipped.  The Knights, Halbruders, and others exercised drills on the castle walls, while the townsfolk were busy staying warm indoors.  Scouts had not yet returned, so the enemy must not have made any advances yet, but everyone knew they were close by.  In fact, they might be consolidating their forces and coming up with a strategy.  Whatever the case, the Brothers had time to wait for reinforcements and prepare.Adrian would want to speak to everyone who volunteered on the first-floor of the castle, and so he waited for them to arrive.", "link_list": ["/user/1342", "/user/648", "/user/139"], "image_list": [], "html": "A frigid chill howls over the tower of the snow-covered red-brick castle, overlooking the small town of Vorstuga.

I want fifty knights, five paladins, one hundred marines, and one hundred seventy five foot troops. Send fifty of the foot soldiers to remove the 75% of the ballistae from the ships and the rest to Vorstuga. When the ballistae is removed, leave twenty five there to man the remaining ballistae on the ships for a little surprise if they try to cross the river. \"Giplor was no fool and his mind could process battleplans like a computer. He needed fifty Knights, five Paladins, one hundred Marines, and one hundred seventy five foot soldiers to take care of all the ballistae for the wall. It would take the men three hours to get the ballistae out, meaning it would take four hours longer to reach Vorstuga than the main force.\u00a0Once the orders were given, Giplor put on his armor and was gone into the night. The cool air created a dew on his armor as the atmosphere around him seemed to be a little damper than most other beings. His white steed moved at a great speed for being loaded down by Giplor in his armor and weaponry.\u00a0At about 4:30a.m., Giplor came barreling into Vorstuga, looking for Komtur Adrian. He knew where to look, it was just a matter of time before being in the right spot at the right time. Adrian was lucky Giplor had been present for winter inspections, as he had found it necessary in Atlanticus due to some of colder northern regions.\u00a0The people of Vorstuga were familiar with Giplor, \"The Blue Knight\" they called him due to the Atlantian styles of his armor.

At about 150, these warriors were known for their mounted archery skills. They each carried a short and long bow for close and long range combat, and a large supply of arrows.

Usually, the garrison would be much larger, but as attacks in winter were usually less-threatening and rare, Konrad reallocated most of his forces elsewhere.  Reinforcing this garrison were those Marines and Knights brought in by Giplor, and Rohak's own contingent of trained militia and the newly established Knights of the Harvest.  Both Rohak of the Dittany and Grand Komtur: Giplor Vauc'Tutt would be directed to the main castle, and the forces would probably intermingle with their brethren throughout the town - or take part in the training exercises with the militia and sergeants.The red-brick castle was surrounded by a large square-shaped fortified wall, and each corner had a high tower.  The western gatehouse was a normal gatehouse, with two small towers on either end.  The eastern gatehouse, the one facing the bridge and leading into the Eastern March, was noticeably more fortified with higher towers, and more defenses.  Entering the walls would bring the visitors into the eastern or western courtyard, the western one which held a beautiful garden, which then led into the first floor of the castle.  It was in this first floor that Giplor and Rohak would find many high-ranking Knights conversing.  They would greet the two commanders with utmost respect, as order and discipline was priority to them.The castle was warm and comfy, with vaulted ceilings, smooth white walls, beautiful marble columns, and black and white tiled floors.  At the moment, the room was devoid of items, but on usual days it would be occupied with elaborate chairs and tables to feast on.  An assortment of finely-made rugs were spread out nicely on the floor, giving it a palace-like feel.  A number of pictures hanging on the wall included paintings of notable commanders - including one of Giplor in combat with Wickans during the Battle of the Vorstuga River - as well as other notable friends and members of the order.The Brothers, however, were never meant to live in such comfort.  Such luxury and 'materialistic' things should have been out of question for the Knights.  But there was more to it than that.  Konrad I had plans for this castle.  When visitors and other warriors came to crusade in the Eastern March, he needed to impress them.  It was kings, princes, princesses, and other nobles who deserved this elaborate palace-like castle, and he wanted them to feel at home and comfortable in the otherwise dangerous March.\"Ah, Brother Giplor!  Brother Rohak!  You have answered the call to arms.\"  Adrian approached both of his allies and shook their hands firmly.  \"The Hochmeister suggested I lead the defense of Vorstuga, but I encourage you to share this burden with me.\"  Adrian was not entirely confident in his abilities, and his facial expression echoed a sense of worry.  \"Forgive my nervousness, things have been a bit hectic for me lately.  Konrad must remain in Salem with Lady Audrey to make important political decisions.  Now, come with me.\"  Adrian would lead the two men in a brisk walk to a separate room.  This room was spacious to allow several others, and in the center was a table.  A map of the town and surrounding countryside was sprawled across its surface.Pointing east of Vorstuga, Adrian began.  \"Several miles east, our scouts reported a gathering of enemy troops.  The woods are thick and the snowfall heavy, so estimates of their size and composition could not be obtained.  However, they also reported seeing movement further out, so we suspect they're gathering their strength out there before moving further westward.\"Adrian then moved his hand to Vorstuga, pointing at the bridge.  \"Our initial strategy for the castle was to bottleneck enemy forces on the bridge and rain crossbow fire on them... but the river is frozen solid and that cancels that strategy out.  Fortunately, we still have the walls of the castle.  I'd like to gauge the enemy's strength and composition before moving out against them, so I suggest we wait for them here.\"\"There are two major concerns we have so far.  First of all, the enemy may be using this attack as a distraction.  Crossing the deep Vorstuga River, especially with a large army, is a monumental task.  Pinning our forces here will allow the enemy ample time to cross the river elsewhere.  The southern reaches of the river is surrounded by bug-infested swampland and disease, so I suspect they'll attempt to cross the Vorstuga in the north.  The other concern is... well, we're curious what we're up against.  It's common knowledge that a general should never march his armies in the dead of winter - especially with a large force like we suspect.  It's a logistical miracle that they have maintain their numbers in this climate.  We believe something else is going on here... just how do they have the supplies to sustain their forces in the wintry forest?  And how have so many men survived the cold?  It's unnerving.\"Adrian crossed his arms and looked at the table, then back at his allies.  \"So, any tactical suggestions that would help in the defense of the castle?

The warriors yelled out in unison at their commander, \"this day, Vorstuga shall fall!\"They were prepared for battle.\u00a0 Four teams of bridge-carriers came out of the battle line, carrying several ladders.\u00a0 The carriers were equipped with shields and short swords, and their main goal was to stand the bridges up alongside the castle wall.\u00a0 Fortunately, the river was frozen over, so they could traverse over it.North, up the river, a smaller detachment of about 500 men worked quickly to lay contraptions on the river.  These contraptions were wooden surfaces with pontoons beneath them that allowed them to float in the water; they could be fastened together, and the first one was fastened to some trees on the river bank; it was a pontoon bridge.
