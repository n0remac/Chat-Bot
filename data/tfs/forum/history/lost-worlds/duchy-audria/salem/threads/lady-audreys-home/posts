There, they traveled to the town of Salem, and then to the estate where Lady Audrey lived.  It was also the residence of the former Hochmeister of the Brotherhood: Konrad IV von Marschburg.Slowing down to a trot, Adrian led Grandma around the circular pathways that circled the gardens in front of Audrey's home.  Two armed guards came to Adrian's aid and took the reins of both horses.  \"Adrian!\" they exclaimed excitedly.  \"We heard what happened in the Free Plains!  We are relieved to see you are safe!\"Adrian smiled and nodded at them, \"it is good to be back in Audria, my Brothers!\"  He dismounted and waited for Grandma.  \"Come, we must speak to-\"\"Me?\"  A deep, commanding voice boomed from up the steps.  The imposing figure of Konrad stood at the top.  His cold, hard, stern face glared down at Adrian and Grandma, arms folded behind his back.  \"Adrian.  You have returned.  Maybe not the best time... but I am happy nonetheless.\"\"Something wrong, sir?\" Adrian inquired.\"It could induce... diplomatic nightmares with the Israns.\"  The man shook his head and walked down to greet both Adrian and Grandma.  \"But it shouldn't matter.  The Israns still supply us with much-needed materials, as per our deal with Ildesias.  I suppose we're on good terms with them.\"  He then turned his attention to Grandma.  \"The Brothers owe you a debt, Grandma.

While you're not just some mercenary, you are one of my preferred associates.

Lady Audrey is busy and so she will not be around to complain about mud and dirt,\" he joked, ascending the steps and leading Grandma and Adrian inside.The entrance was a large room covered in blue carpet, with two rug-covered staircases on either side leading up to another room on the fer end of the building.  It was very elegant, very professional in the area; clearly fit for a woman of royalty.  Paintings, plaques, and mannequins decorated the light yellow walls, as a blue trimming arched up into the high ceiling.  Natural light from the windows gave the room a very lively feel.  A set of cushioned chairs and couches were set along the stairs, with some tables, lamps, and small book cases.Konrad offered Adrian and Grandma a seat.  \"Now tell me what is of dire importance, Brother Adrian.  What happened in Isra?\"Adrian sighed, wore out from the journey.  \"After I left the Brotherhood... me and a few Brother Knights went back to Crim to see what power we could find.\"Konrad shook his head shamefully.  \"I told you to stay away from that place, Adrian.\"Shaking his head, he continued.  \"Yes, yes... but the people of Isra needed more protection.  I wanted to give that to them.  When we entered the keep we became indoctrinated.  A presence which we call the Voice took over our minds, and there was nothing we could do.  It wasn't until Brother Hansel came to rescue me that the indoctrination was broke.  But while I was under the spell of the Voice, she gave me visions.  I saw... I saw the Scripture!  I know where it is... or I did.  I also saw other things... bad things.\"  Adrian shook his head in semi-terror.  He was clearly disturbed.Konrad was clearly interested in the location of the Scripture.  \"A report mentioned you were unable to comprehend the visions.\"  Adrian nodded.  \"What about Grandma?  Have you showed them to her?\"\"Grandma!\" Adrian exclaimed.  \"Yes!  Yes, yes, of course.  Let me show them to you,\" he finished.  Assuming Grandma would allow him, and assuming she was able, he would do as she required and transmit the visions into her mind, and they both enter a terrible and convulsive trance.Darkness.... the silhouette of a woman's figure moves as a light appears... flashes of red.... a flash of white...Everything reverts to darkness.  And then the face of an old hag, whose eyes have been cut from her head appears.  She wears a tattered black hood, is missing her teeth, and has her eyelids sewed shut.  She opens her voice and a foreboding message comes from it.\"And I beheld She, who visits a throne which is not hers.  She is shamed and returns to her own throne, but it is no longer her own.  And then I beheld He, the rider of an albino beast with the wings of an eagle!  He, who was Her savior and who carried Her into the skies, must make the choice... but only if She gives in....\"More visions appear.  Alden, Emahra, and Lamina walk through a dark tunnel, carrying with them an orb of great power.  The voice of the Voice emanates from it.Adrian reawakens from the trance, shaking and out of breath, sweating.  \"I... I have never seen that before,\" he exclaims, his voice one of surprise.  \"I... I don't know what it means.\"  He buried his face into his eyes.  \"I am sorry Grandma.  I wish it could have been more clearer... but this clearly a warning.  For who, I do not know.  But the orb... that is the source.  The Voice was forcing us to excavate underneath Crim to find that orb.  It's a portal of some kind, to another dimension.
