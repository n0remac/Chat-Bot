When do we head out,\" Dietrich asked eagerly.  The Sadist's bloodlust could not be sated.\"Easy, my old friend,\" Konrad said, \"I assure you, the time will come.

It was fitting, considering Krypt himself had almost two feet and twice as much muscle on most men, and only such a powerful horse could carry him into battle. A thick fur cloak lay around his shoulders, and a large spear tipped with some form of bone-craft blade was held firmly in the right hand that was resting down by his side. He pulled the reigns, bringing his steed to a halt just long enough to push his hair back away from his face and get a good look at the gathered army. It seemed strong enough; it was about to become stronger. Within moments, he set off again in a trot, pulling from his cloak the notice with a request for mercenaries, and he cast it down at the nearest soldier for an explanation for his presence. \"When do we march?\" He called out, his voice a boom. \"I have other matters I would like to attend to, so I will win this battle quickly.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Krypt rode down into the mustering field upon a black horse larger than any other steed that many of the men there would have ever seen.

At the sound of it, the Knight-Brothers and other volunteers quickly got up to prepare to march eastward, into the Eastern March.  Metal clanged, weapons jingled, and the sound of thousands of footsteps filled the air.  Beds were rolled and tents taken down, horses saddled and swords sheathed.By that time Konrad motioned for the squire to bring his horse up.  He pulled himself up, a tall man he was, but the size of Krypt's horse made them almost equal in height.  \"Come with me, mercenary.  You've a certain... look about you.

Stepping out of the bushes Silas came face to face with the army and paused.  It had been a long while sense he had seen such a sight and for the first time in a long time his blood began to heat up with real excitement.  Butterflies fluttered in his stomach as apprehension and fear joined in. Temporarily the emotional cocktail sobered him up. Unconsciously he straightened and for a moment looked more like a soldier then a deadbeat drunk.  Then as the initial shock and adrenaline wore off the dull haze of a fading drunk returned.
