Should Jun accompany him, the doors would open at his approach, and they'd find themselves in a long hallway with a tall arched ceiling, lit by shining silvery-white crystals high above. The walls were lined with paintings and sculptures depicting various things, which he pointed out to her.\"That is Esdar, the Winged God of the Winds and Skies, He that Raised the Land, our deity and savior. When the Myst threatened to destroy us, He lifted us into the skies so that we would be saved, and gave us our Holy Creed. According to the Word of Esdar, the Myst is a product of the demon Xoilun, who wishes to blot out life upon the world and turn it to darkness, that he may then populate the earth with his foul creations. To fight against this, Esdar gave great power to us, His chosen people - specifically the priesthood, and the Esdar'ial, like the Blade and the Crown, those few of us who are fortunate enough to show the proof of Esdar's blessing in emulation of His shape: Those with wings. Now, as for our values...\"He stopped beneath a sculpture of an elegant winged man and woman, one bearing the same powerful sword the High Priest carried, the other wearing the crown that the High Priestess had. Between them was a scroll, inscribed with script; he looked up at it and smiled slightly.\"I could read our holy law to you, but that's probably not what you're asking about, is it? Esdar's will is that we should fill our hearts with light and goodness. It is his wish that one day, all men will drive darkness and evil from their hearts, and in doing so, Xoilun will be vanquished forever. Our laws, our creed, are based around this basic tenet: All will give part of their wealth, skill, and time to the church, that we may use it to help those in need. Killing is anathema, lest it be in self-defense, for food, or by decree of the church. Our word is our bond, and we take our promises very seriously - we will not forsake them, just as Esdar has not forsaken his vow to watch over us. Taking from others or mistreating them is the work of Xoilun, and will not be tolerated.\"He resumed walking, leading Jun along, until they came to a line of five paintings. Three men, two women, all winged, and each with a winged symbol above their heads. The priest gestured to these as he explained.\"These are the Caerleis and Caerleia, who were raised to sit beside Esdar Himself after their lives were spent - or lost - in the epitome of servitude to Him. Telantes, Erelim, Caphriel, Naya'il, and Anael were priests, and it is after them that our orders are named, and they who we serve to emulate. I can tell you more about them later, if you wish, but I think there is one last thing that you'll find very interesting.\"He continued, and soon they came upon a long mural. It began with the raising of the land, showing the anointing of the first High Priest and High Priestess, as well as the transformation of one of the Esdar'ial into a great feathered dragon, in possession of a gleaming jewel. This dragon battled against an amorphous figure comprised of the Myst, and was struck down, its shining gem broken in half and one half lost into the Myst below the hovering shape of the island. As they walked and saw more of the mural, he explained.\"What you're seeing is the raising of the land, and the proclamation of the first Winged Blade and Winged Crown. That man there, being changed into a great being, is the Skywarden - he was given his powers by Esdar to protect both the land of Esdara, and the Skies themselves from any threats, be they Xoilun-derived, magical, or caused by humanity. Sadly, he was lost in a fight against Xoilun, many centuries ago. But our legends foretell that he will return to us, and Esdara will enter a new age of untold prosperity.\"Sure enough, the end of the mural showed the return of the dragon, and the land of Esdara bathed in light. Having reached the end of the hallway, the priest pushed open another door identical to the first, which let them into a great library. It was at least three stories tall, with tall arched windows that let light come streaming in, and filled floor to ceiling with books and scrolls. Turning to Jun with a smile, he gestured to the room.\"Feel free to read and explore to your heart's content, Lady Hero.

She'd never seen such a large collection of knowledge all in one place before. Very impressive, in truth. She really should visit the Guardian Tower, one of these days, she'd heard the number of books there was considerable. Walking over to the nearest bookcase, she plucked a random book off a shelf at about eye-level, one with a green leather binding, and flipped it open.<br><br/><font color=\"green\">\"So many dragons.

Her face turned red just as she was perusing a book of religious hymns as if it was filled with inappropriate material. \"I'm sure those tales have been exaggerated. To this day I believe I am still unaware of the full extent of my celebrity.\"But when Va'nei\u00a0inquired about her desire to learn magic and combat, Jun unconsciously bit her lower lip. She put the book back on the shelf and folded her arms. She turned to face Va'nei and leaned her shoulder against the shelf. Her gaze fell to somewhere on Va'nei's\u00a0clothing. She didn't dare make eye contact with the ancient dragon. \"I... guess at this point it's a long story. And frankly it's not one I'm proud of.\"Her shoulder rolled to the side so that her back was now facing the interior of the library. She looked around while trying to figure out how to articulate it all. \"... It all started, as a result of feelings of inadequacy and jealousy. And sadness. I'm sure you know about the chaos mages, and how my grandmother was one of them. When you blessed the land for our sake, the magic of the earth created a lineage of powerful beings called chaos mages. Every few hundred years, a person who is in tune with both light and darkness, who has a strong sense of justice, is chosen to be one of these beings. And one of them was my grandmother.\"Jun's eyes went glassy as she started to have flashbacks of Lynx' incredible power. She could still see those flames and how Lynx was able to fell entire forests and bring down dragons with crashing fist. \"It's never easy, having a gifted member of the family, someone who is so incredibly beyond you that it makes you feel like an insect. I loved my grandmother. I really did. But I was the type of child who always wanted to be respected, who wanted to achieve. Call me insecure but I hate losing to people. If nothing else I wanted people to feel like I could always go toe to toe with them, not even necessarily win just, be on par, y'know? I used to study all the time because I wanted to keep up with the smartest kids. I didn't go to the Wizard's Tower because my grandmother wanted to teach me herself, but I still used to practice with those kids. And I would keep studying and practicing until I could beat them in duels. For me, my grandmother would be my final rival.\"Jun sighed. \"And then she died. I was 12 I think. And I was torn up inside. For some reason I thought she would always be there. I don't know why, she was fairly old. But when she died it left this big void inside me. And, I guess I thought I could fill it by always striving to be the best, even though I knew technically I would never be able to keep up with her. Chaos mages are only chosen every few hundred years. I will never, ever become one. So, I was trapped, trying to achieve an unachievable goal. I tortured myself for almost half my life because of it. You can see why I'm not the most stable person.\" She chuckled, not totally realizing that Va'nei was unfamiliar with her short temper, bouts of awkwardness, and mood swings.\"You know, I used to have an incredibly violent mind. I used to try to hide it. But, well let me put it to you this way. Before I became a holy mage under Lum'Valia's tutelage, I used to be able to wield demon magic. I could slice my hands and use my own blood to devastating effect. You can't imagine how much anger and hatred it takes to do that. If you look at my body, it's covered in 'battle scars'.\" She made air quotes when she said battle scars. After a moment Jun actually scowled and brought her eyes closer to Va'nei's, but still not quite making eye contact. \"I'm not going to elaborate further on that.\"Jun shrugged. \"I was obsessed. I struggled with both light and dark magic, but the truth is, I leaned towards the darkness. Actually, I can still use dark magic despite becoming a holy mage, a vestige of my former self. And I think if Lum'Valia hadn't found me, I probably would have become evil.\" Jun smiled. Her visage and even the air around her changed completely. \"You know, I just realized, I've been talking for a really, really long time.\" Jun waved her hands. \"Kun kuz buld.\" Just behind Va'nei appeared a glimmering, crystalline object. It was a chair, and a rather comfortable looking one at that, made of holy energy. She invited her to sit, but she remained leaning against the bookcase.\"The things she showed me are a tale unto themselves. But basically I got to say goodbye to my grandmother one last time, and I realized that deep down inside, all that anger and hatred, all that jealousy, it wasn't really me. I realized that all my angst and suffering would go away if I committed to being my own person, doing my own thing, and finding my own path. I realized that I could re-appropriate my hunger for power into a desire to protect those I care about. I realized I didn't have to be the person that I was. I could choose something better. What I really am, deep down inside, is a naive, determine, heroic bookworm.\"Jun raised one of her hands up to her face. A small flame appeared in it, which she stared at with pride. \"Funny thing is, now that I've been cleansed of my inner demons, so to speak, I'm enjoying learning new magic now more than ever! I feel like I'm doing it for myself and for the people I care about, rather than for some stupid unobtainable goal. I can still seek power and be competitive, but in a healthy, fulfilling way, rather than the metaphorical fairy-dust addict I was before.\"She closed her palm and extinguished the flame. \"I feel like I've grown a lot over the last few years, and I want to continue to grow, both in my abilities and as an individual.\" It was at this point finally that Jun made eye contact with Va'nei. But then suddenly her face contorted into a perplexed look and she started to blink rapidly. \"Wait a second, what was the question again?\" She asked, embarrassed.", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/post/14251", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/post/16001/thread", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/post/22462"], "image_list": [], "html": "How many times would Jun blush today?

Though it may be difficult to see to those not accustomed to it, each word is written in a way that attempts to to be aesthetically pleasing. Yet it it also much more than this; each stroke of the brush displays a certain skill of the hand and wrist, with strokes themselves telling a unique story. Each has an emotion implanted subconsciously by the artist,\"He took the brush and, with the tip covered in ink, touched it down to the scroll and began to slowly paint a single word in a strange, distant language.\"And together they work in harmony with the final result - the word, or words, that have been made. It takes many years of practice and study to fully appreciate, yet a master of this art can look upon a painted word and all of it's aspects. From the word itself, to the skill of the calligrapher, to each line of paint and the emotion in every swipe of the brush; a master can use these to see an entire story in his mind, to understand the message the calligrapher wished to convey.\"\"Yet even that isn't the end of it. A master can look upon a piece of calligraphy written a thousand years ago and from that alone he can judge the qualities of the artist. He can estimate age, gender, level of calligraphic potency and even his physical prowess and skill in fighting with the fist and the sword.\"Eventually Hiro finished his word and placed the brush back in the pot.\"This scroll was small enough for this work to be quick, but some calligraphers spend weeks on a single piece large enough to cover a wall. My work here also displays one of the most difficult yet highly prized aspects of calligraphy, which is the creation of a new word.\"He smiled.\"In my language, each word can be written in many different ways depending on the context in which they are used. Sometimes, a master calligrapher is able to surmise a new way to write a word and then paints it upon a scroll; these pieces become worth all the gold a king can store in his castle, for they represent the pinnacle of intellect and culture. The artist gains fame that spans the land and his skills are sought after by the greatest of Emperor's for their knowledge and advice.\"\"Unfortunately this piece is not such one.

Esdara was once part of the land below - this island inhabited the Valley which now resides beneath us. We lived in peace for many generations, growing our crops and raising our children. But then came a time when Xoilun, the Demon, appeared among us. He thrives on the darkness within our hearts, a creature of pure evil.\"As he walked, the priest gestured to a painting, indicating a semi-amorphous black mass with evilly glowing yellowish eyes, clawed appendages reaching out toward a peaceful pastoral village ringed by mountaintops. He would continue to point to historically and mythologically relevant paintings and sculptures as they passed them.\"In his desire to take over the world and cast it under a permanent pall of darkness, Xoilun created the Myst, a terrible miasma which blotted out the light of the sun, withering our crops and sickening our people. The people cried out for salvation to the various gods we worshiped at the time, but only one answered - Esdar, the Winged God of the Winds and Skies.\"He gestured to another painting and continued on.\"Esdar heard the pleas of the High Priest and High Priestess at the time, and in all his merciful power, he raised the land into the sky, freeing us from Xoilun's Myst. Our nation was renamed to Esdara, the Land of Esdar, and he became our sole religious entity. The High Priest and High Priestess were given the Winged Blade and the Winged Crown by Esdar himself, as signs of their new positions as the leader of our society, and they as well as the clergy of the time were given the gift of sanctity - wings. One of these winged men was chosen and given another great gift, a gem of great power which transformed him into the Skywarden, a dragon who watches the skies - Esdar bade him protect us. In addition to this, Esdar proclaimed his Holy Creed, which has been changed only at his behest throughout these thousand years, as he speaks to us through the Winged Blade of Justice and the Winged Crown of Grace.\"About one hundred fifty years after we were raised from perdition, Xoilun struck again. The Winged Blade, Winged Crown, and Skywarden went forth to meet him, and both the Crown and the Skywarden were defeated - the Skywarden's gem broken, his body cast to the world below, and the Crown slain. But their loss was not in vain, as Xoilun's physical form was shattered and his power was cast back to the void between space and time. There he waits, biding his time until he has the strength to return, and try to destroy us once more. For the past thousand years, we've thought we were alone up here - that the entire world had been devoured by the remnants of Xoilun's Myst. It's quite a relief to know that we're not alone!\"Having pointed to various paintings of the Blade and Crown, the Skywarden, the battle, and et cetera, they finally arrived at another set of doors that let into a library. Several stories tall and lit by arching windows, it was stuffed to bursting with books on numerous tall bookcases. Stopping just inside the library, he turned to face Grandma with a smile.\"And there is the basis of our history. Our religion has a focus on doing what is right - Esdar's one true wish for this world is to see darkness driven from the hearts of all beings, that Xoilun can never again find the power to return to this world. I can get you a copy of our Holy Creed, if you'd like, or you're welcome to peruse our library.

This was the type of thing Grandma had been hoping to hear about on her travel here. The mention of Xoilun intrigued her, for although they called it a demon, she suspected it was quite possibly something else. Although there were other places demons could come from, the Hellscape was where the majority of the ones in this realm seemed to be from, and in her estimation, none of the ones from it were strong enough to cause such a commotion alone.To her, Xoilun sounded like a creature that wandered around looking for things to feed on. Perhaps something with more primal instincts that lacked intelligence and was simply feeding out of instinct. According to the story he told her, it thrived on the darkness within the people's hearts. Perhaps a creature that fed on others negative emotions? That would explain why it created a mist instead of a more direct attack. The inhabitants would have plenty of time to suffer and feel anger and hatred towards it before dying, allowing it to feed off of them more.Of course, this was all conjecture, Grandma couldn\u2019t even be sure if this information was accurate, as in her experience stories passed down from generation to generation drastically changed. Still, because of how isolated Esdara was, the chance that the truth had been preserved through the generations was higher than average. They also most likely meant \u2018demon\u2019 in a more generic term than most, meaning it could be referring to any number of unsavory creatures.Then Esdar was mentioned, their sole deity. They considered it a god, but Grandma always viewed such things in a different light due to her nature. It sounded like a benevolent realm traveler of sorts to her, although the motivations of such creatures are lost to her. Still, perhaps a creature of that variety had taken pity on the people of Esdara or perhaps it had a natural dislike of Xoilun. Whatever the case, it had used a great deal of powerful magic to lift this piece of land and suspend it in the sky. Of all the parts of the story, Esdar seemed to have the most proof backing its existence, because massive chunks of land didn\u2019t just go floating into the sky without reason. Then the Wind Warden was mentioned. Grandma had heard mention of the other various dragon wardens, they appeared to protect whatever part of this realm they were tied to. He also mentioned the current rulers had artifacts given to them by Esdar, which was quite interesting. Grandma would have to eventually try and get a look at them to see if they appeared to be the real deal, but that would most likely be too difficult to do initially. The final part of the tale was expected, they had banished Xoilun at the cost of some of their greatest assets. Many tales ended in such a manner, but that didn\u2019t necessarily make Grandma doubt it. She needed to make sure to be respectful when mentioning their history, even if she viewed things in a different way, she mustn\u2019t let such views spill out lest they offend the people of Esdar.\u201cYour nation has quite the rich history going just off what you told me right now. I\u2019m quite interested in discovering even more. I will take you up on your offer of having a copy of your Holy Creed and perusing your library, as for questions\u2026\u201dGrandma paused for a moment, she definitely had plenty of questions but needed to phrase them properly.\u201cWell, my first inquiry is, for what reason did Esdar not intervene directly in the conflict. From the story you tell me, it seems that Esdar has plenty of power, first saving your people from the mist when they were at their weakest, and then giving them the tools they need to defeat Xoilun. Do you believe it was because he wished to make the people of Esdar more self-sufficient?\u201dGrandma hoped the man wouldn\u2019t be offended about questioning their god's motives, but she wished to ask the question. Depending on the answer, she would be able to gauge how the people of Esdara generally viewed their deity.
