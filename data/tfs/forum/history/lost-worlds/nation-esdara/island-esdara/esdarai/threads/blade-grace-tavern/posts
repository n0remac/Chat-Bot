His voice took upon it a poetic, melodramatic tone, a small he recounted his uncles story.\"You see - My uncle, at around the age of eighteen was an adventurer by trade. He utilised his magics in order to gain treasure at the bottoms of numerous crypts and dungeons. Across one of his travels, he found himself with a peculiar tablet, infused with ancient writing, indecipherable to them. Upon touching said tablet, he was assaulted by a maleficent demon. By his magic, and a great deal of luck, he defeated the demon and therefore bend it to his will. The only thing he told the demon was one wish, to take him to the sky. It was with that the demon granted him his wish, and he was transported to the realm of Esdara.\"\"At least that is what he told me, anyway. I've got no way to validate it, except from this sketch he made.\"He reached into his cloak and produced a weathered journal. Opening it, he leafed through the pages, then held up a diagram of what appeared to be a city square. He obviously hadn't seen the place, but hopefully this Esdara would recognise the location and confirm his uncles story.

However, it looked as if this was in his favour. Dasyra was a citizen of Esdara, so she would most certainly know where he should look. In fact, he was quite frustrated with himself. If his father was here, he'd give him a right clout to his ear for his short-sightedness.\u00a0\"Well.. to be honest, I don't know my way around this place. I'm terribly sorry to ask this of you, but could you give me a tour?\"He crossed his fingers, hoping she would accept his offer. She was the only person Bishop could go to. He had no real contacts, or friends otherwise. If she declined, he'd have to find his way around Esdara by his lonesome.
