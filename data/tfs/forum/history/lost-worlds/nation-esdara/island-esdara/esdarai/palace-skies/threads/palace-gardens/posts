The activity was a common one for the elegant woman with her white hair and white-feathered wings, which were currently tucked against her back - the grass beneath her feet, the scent of the varicolored flowers all around her, the feel of the wind brushing across her skin.. she felt that it all brought her a little closer to Esdar, allowing her mind and spirit to be open to the touch of their God. Coming across a singularly lovely flower of a brilliant purplish hue, she stopped and leaned down to inhale its fragrance, her hand moving to let fingertips lightly touch the base of the silky-soft petals.But when her skin touched the flower, it immediately wilted, crumbling into a thick, grey miasma. Soon the entire garden was vanishing into nothing more than that cloying fog. A shudder ran down Ysaera's back as she realized what this was. The Myst. The palace faded from existence around her, and she looked on with horror in her pale grey eyes as she was transported to a valley, full of Myst and rocks. A creature of black bone loomed above her, formed from the Myst, and roared, lashing out at her with a great talon-tipped appendage. Just before the strike could land, the monster exploded in fire and light, the Myst and the valley disappearing. Instead, she found herself standing before the Door of Vothiea, the green light which filled the portal's archway shimmering as something began to emerge from it.The High Priestess staggered as the vision abruptly ceased, and she pressed a hand to her midriff as the air rushed out of her, as though she'd been struck. So. Esdar had given her a prophecy. Something was going to come out of the Door. She wasn't certain if it was the monster she'd seen, or whatever had destroyed it, but neither was good - something, or someone, strong enough to annihilate a beast made of the Myst would be a force to be reckoned with. Straightening, she ruffled her wings and turned to the pair of Temple Guards who were trailing her, gesturing to @aztiel as she spoke in her melodic voice.\"Guard Aztiel, you will accompany me. You.\" This was said as she directed her gaze to the other Guard. \"You will locate Kin'Zik immediately, and tell him to meet me within the sitting room. Tell him it is urgent.\" Kin'Zik Tearney was the right-hand man of both the High Priestess and the High Priest, and the Temple Guard all knew that if either the Blade or the Crown needed him urgently, there was no time to waste. Without waiting to see whether or not her commands had been obeyed (for they undoubtedly had), she began to make her way through the gardens toward the palace proper, lifting the filmy pale gold skirts of her robes (designed specifically to be easily put on and taken off around her wings) out of the way of her rapid strides.", "link_list": ["/user/1691"], "image_list": [], "html": "<font face=\"times\">It was a day just like any other - the High Priestess was moving through the gardens of the palace in quiet introspection.
