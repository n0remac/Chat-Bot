He glanced at the guards, the decorations, all things that were and could be of interest to a curious traveller like himself. He had never quite been in a place like this before - yet even with it's architectural and cultural differences taken into account, he had never quite been this close to royalty. When finally they entered the throne room  and he looked upon the Winged Crown of Grace, he instinctively pressed his fist against his other palm and then bowed his body low. He did not sink to his knees like Dasyra; if only because his own culture's display of respect was different and he had not had the time or the lessons on how to properly show it in this flying nation. \"Uhh...
