Many rivers flow through Esdar'ai, and the city is filled with ponds and lakes of varying sizes, leaving a number of bridges to arch gracefully over canals and across the ponds and lakes.Interesting places and focal locations of the city are the Plaza of Aeleria, the Esdaran Market, and the Blade and Grace Tavern. Named for a former High Priestess who gave her life to save the people of Esdara, and whose statue dominates the circular area, this square is an important meeting place for the city's denizens, as it provides direct access to both the High Church of Esdar, the Council Hall (where the Council of Winds meets), and the path to the Palace of the Skies. Notices can be found here posted to columns and walls, and a number of fountains ring the area, as well as small patches of garden and benches on which to sit.he main market of Esdara rests in the heart of the city, near the Plaza of Aeleria. Filled with shops selling goods of all sorts, it's a thriving hub for the nation's economy.Popular with the Zanora Riders (and the other military of Esdara) the Blade & Grace Tavern is well known for its exceptional food, even better spirits, and relaxed atmosphere.

The first was what sounded like a cacophonous, multi-tonal roar, as of many voices of different pitch and resonance crying out simultaneously. It was soon overtaken by something that could only be described as a great rushing of air, which soon manifested in powerful winds sweeping across the island and toward the visible spires of the castle.Suddenly, it all ceased, and a nearly ominous stillness fell across the floating land for several seemingly infinite heartbeats.Without warning, a great beam of blindingly brilliant golden-white light shot upward from the castle, obliterating it. The unholy roar sounded again, and the wind which had been drawn toward the castle now came pouring out from it. Winged beasts began to pour over the walls of the castle grounds on the tide of this wind -- the ferocious winged lions, the sokeli; the graceful winged deer, the nimuar; and the valiant giant eagles, the zanora, both with riders and without.The Esdarans were amazed to see all three species of creature descending into the city streets, landing wherever they were able to find room for their bodies and ignoring each other. The reason why soon became apparent when a figure in resplendent blue and silver armor wheeled overhead, calling out in a booming masculine voice.\"Esdara is no more! The Palace is gone and the island is beginning to crumble! Mount up and flee to safety, people of Esdar!\"No sooner had the words left the mouth of the leader of the Zanora Riders than it became painfully obvious he was speaking the truth. The ground beneath their feet began to tremble, and from the direction of the palace, any watchful eye would see what appeared to be a thick mist rising, accompanied by a sound like sand in a giant hourglass. It was true -- Esdara was disintegrating. Screams erupted as people began to flee, hurrying toward lion, deer, and eagle alike, intent on leaving their home while they still could.(Note: All PCs have one turn to post leaving the island before its destruction. Any Esdaran characters may post their character evacuating if they so choose.
