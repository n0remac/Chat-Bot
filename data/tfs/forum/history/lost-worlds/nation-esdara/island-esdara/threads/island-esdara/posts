Regularly patrolled by zanora riders to keep the people safe and let them know they're being cared for, all sorts can be seen traveling in everything from opulent carriages to hay wagons, and some choose nothing but their own two feet to carry them about.Places of interest include the expansive fields and orchards on the northern side of the island.
