It is a prominent structure atop rocky terrain that allows those within to see a good distance in every direction, the fortress is well equipped with mages who can detect invaders. As an additional protective measure, the walls and stone surrounding it are heavily imbued with warding and structural magics to protect the building and the land upon which it rests. All border fortresses are manned by minimum fifty eagle riders and about a hundred regular infantry, and the eagle riders do constant overlapping patrols between fortresses to ensure the security of the nation\u2019s borders.(All individuals seeking entry to Esdara via the western edge of the island will need to stop at the fortress before being permitted entry into the nation proper. Those who try to bypass the fortress or the patrols will be met with force.)", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/GE6TpCX.jpg"], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/GE6TpCX.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/></div>"}, "post-54499": {"user": "Grandma", "user_num": 602, "timestamp": "1477348129000", "message": "A black speck would slowly appear on the horizon, very small but moving towards the western border very rapidly. From far away, all that was visible was a darkish colored sphere that appeared to have a diameter of about seven feet, growing easier to see by the second. As the sphere moved closer, it slowed in speed considerably, circling around the fortress, most likely looking where to land.After a few seconds of this, it would float down, revealing on closer inspection that a person was inside this strange sphere. The sphere was rather translucent, allowing those close by to see Grandma clearly through it, although with a blackened tint. When it was about one foot above the ground, the sphere would dissipate, Grandma falling with surprising grace to the fortress floor below. Cane in hand, at this point Grandma would look around for a guard, although it was quite possibly one had followed her down here after seeing the rather odd way in which she had arrived.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "A black speck would slowly appear on the horizon, very small but moving towards the western border very rapidly.
