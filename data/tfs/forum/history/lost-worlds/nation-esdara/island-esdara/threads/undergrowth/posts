Vines snaked around, choking the weakest of the trees and bushes. Each plant sprung towards the sky, reaching desperately for the sun, shadowing those who could not. Those who cannot reach the sky quickly die, and are replaced. The plants here grow supernaturally fast - growing several inches per day, an aftermath of a magical experiment gone wrong. It is a place of nature and solely nature only. No human could live in such a place. It is dark and foreboding. Those who attempt to navigate the place will likely become lost, and will fall prey to the plants. As tranquil as they may seem, they are hostile, in ways you wouldn't expect.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/14/af/d0/14afd00d290e9c7ebd69501bf6346b36.jpg"], "html": "<div align=\"center\" style=\"font-size:40px;\">The Undergrowth</div>"}, "post-58709": {"user": "Aubrey", "user_num": 2026, "timestamp": "1482753549000", "message": "She was lost. A wrong turn, here and there, and here she had ended up. This imposing jungle. Well, not a jungle. A foresty-jungle. It was also a bit more temperate. And had less leeches. And tigers. And tropical disease. At least that's an upside. She'd read about these things in her Wilderness Survival Guide by Elber Smith. She hadn't brought that book. Now thinking about it, she probably should have. Each step she took had no end goal, she had no-where to go, and was utterly disorientated. She pushed away a branch, trying her very best not to dirty her garb. She continued on, towards a hopeful hole in the forest, a light at the end of the tunnel, a chance to escape.Nothing.No way to leave.She was lost.Out of sheer desperation, she had only one choice. She whipped out her satchel, lifting out one of her books. She let her hands feel the treated leather of the tome. It was enchanted. She tapped twice on one end, unlocking it. Now, which page. She flicked through... checking.. checking... where was it... here it is! She triumphantly lifted the book up, lifting the book closer to her face. Aubrey analysed the lines, watching each word like a hawk, incessant on finding the information she needed.Shining Beacon. That was the spells name. She read all the mumbo-jumbo for the incantation. You needed to say this word, this word and this word... she repeated the incantation under her breath, drilling it into her memory how she must say it.\u00a0\"Petrus affala toreecz al parena!\"She sounded like an idiot, pointing her finger towards the sky. You could almost tell she was a terrible magician. However terrible she may be at magic, she seemed to have gotten lucky. Light sprayed from her fingertips, a golden ball firing itself through the forest canopy, creating a blatant signal. It would be visible from miles away. Hopefully someone could help her. Anyone.But she didn't know if anyone had received that. All she could do was wait. In the quiet, foreboding and dark forest.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "She was "}, "post-58865": {"user": "Rowen", "user_num": 1171, "timestamp": "1483060889000", "message": "Tink, a soft metallic chime reverberated throughout the surrounding area  as the  ball tipped-end of the lance struck  against  a moss covered  stone. Vibrations shivered along the length of the shaft Imperceptible to  any around him as the  sound washed over the surrounding rocks like  waves lapping gently  against the shore. A figure stood amidst  the  trees; a near  statuesque form motionless as he drew in his  surrounding  though not by sight. The feel of the soft moss underfoot; the sounds of the forest which seemed absent  most creatures. The scent of leaves. The crisp fresh air. Long  raven locks  danced wildly upon  either  shoulder, unkempt and disheveled resembled  the tendrils of roots that  crept  along the ground , flowing  freely  upon the wind before finally settling  against  his back. The  man donned a simple white cloak held  together by a leaf-shaped  clasp, though seemed to wear  little else. The fabric concealed his form easily enough giving the male an appearance of ambiguity; though from the part in the fabric one would be able to see that the male was actually quite thin almost to an unhealthy degree and he was covered almost completely in long strands of white bandages , which coiled  about his torso  and limbs preserving some form of modesty. -The light radiating from the ball released by Aubrey easily  pierced the canopy, causing shadows  to writhe  and dance across the males\u2019 form. Though it made  little difference to Rowen. Light or dark it was all the same. Yet the faint trail of essence lingered and stirred the air. A breath almost  a sigh pushed  the  tops  of the tress causing their  leaves to rustle  and  their branches to clatter.  The male merely listened to  the  sounds of the forest  as a soft  gale of wind tugged lightly at his  cloak. Nature\u2019s  song, a tree among a forest. Perhaps simply there was no meaning to it. After a while it seemed like the male might not move at all when finally he  took a step in the direction  of the  orb. \u2013 perhaps  it was  mere coincidence . There was a certain familiarity in those steps as if the male had  lived there all his life \u2013 each step deliberate as he moved through the forest  avoiding  pitfalls and navigating the most manageable  path with relative ease. Though he soon stopped once more once he  covered a fair distance, striking the butt of the lance against the ground once more- it was almost ritualistic how evenly  paced  the distance.  It was a rather  unusual forest  that the  male  had found  himself  in. The plants  seemed to grow a little  too quickly and he  had lingered long enough to realize. Though he made no effort to leave the forest and despite the oddity. Rowen seemed to blend into  the setting as if simply belonging. He continued in the direction of the h orb despite no knowledge of its presence until he found the source of the anomaly or they found him.
