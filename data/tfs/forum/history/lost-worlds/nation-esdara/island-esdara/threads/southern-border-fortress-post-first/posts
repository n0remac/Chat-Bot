The nearly tropical climate of the island is most prevalent here, resulting in a terrain with many rocks and a profusion of nearly jungle-like vegetation. It is a prominent structure atop rocky terrain that allows those within to see a good distance in every direction, the fortress is well equipped with mages who can detect invaders. As an additional protective measure, the walls and stone surrounding it are heavily imbued with warding and structural magics to protect the building and the land upon which it rests. All border fortresses are manned by minimum fifty eagle riders and about a hundred regular infantry, and the eagle riders do constant overlapping patrols between fortresses to ensure the security of the nation\u2019s borders.(All individuals seeking entry to Esdara via the southern edge of the island will need to stop at the fortress before being permitted entry into the nation proper. Those who try to bypass the fortress or the patrols will be met with force.)", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/Mwm4urB.jpg"], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Mwm4urB.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/></div>"}, "post-58158": {"user": "Fol-lu, Skywarden", "user_num": 1073, "timestamp": "1481575582000", "message": "It was a quiet day thus far at the Southern Border Fortress of Esdara, the sun high in the sky as the clock just turned to noon.
