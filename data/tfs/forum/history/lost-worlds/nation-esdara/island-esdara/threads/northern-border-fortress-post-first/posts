As an additional protective measure, the walls and stone surrounding it are heavily imbued with warding and structural magics to protect the building and the land upon which it rests. All border fortresses are manned by minimum fifty eagle riders and about a hundred regular infantry, and the eagle riders do constant overlapping patrols between fortresses to ensure the security of the nation\u2019s borders.(All individuals seeking entry to Esdara via the northern edge of the island will need to stop at the fortress before being permitted entry into the nation proper.

The  ship  was rather  larger and lurched forward  like a lumbering  giant. Commotion could be heard from the upper decks as the captain issued his command. \u201cHoist the sails!\u201d  Men scurried  and clambered  about drawing on long  twisted  ropes as the sails were slowly  drawn upward and tied off with expert hands, allowing the  ship  to merely  coast towards the  approaching structure, coming to a slow halt  as it reached the  landing  before the gates. Large  arms  could  be seen from  the  upper deck  obviously  used for  the  loading and unloading of  cargo  and the  ship  bobbed only faintly as if upon a gently  wave lowering itself  towards the ground  at least enough for a ramp  to be  extended from its bowels extending towards the small ship.

It was later learned that the ship had arrived with the intentions of doing trade within  the capital however only a small  group of eight  me had actually intended to gain entry. A few horse-drawn  wagons, stacked neatly  with crated goods. Most  filled with silks, and  crafts from far unknown regions. Of course, it was just as likely that they might be turned away.  A rather peculiar sort traveled with them, Rowen. His name given along with the ledger though the  man  appeared to be quite  somber and did not converse  with any unless spoken to directly. Adorned in a white  cloak  which appeared to  be  quite weathered, frayed at the end and stained with dark splotches that was either dirt or blood. Lengths of cloth swayed gently upon the wind, revealing the thin  frame beneath  the man was covered entirely in bandages which coiled about his torso  and limbs like tiny white snakes, tied off about his  wrist and allowed to drop towards the awaiting ground. Within  his  right hand  digits curled around the shaft of  lance, Leaf-bladed tip  bound in the same manner as his skin. Though perhaps most noteworthy was the bright crimson cloth which covered both eye, and  helped to tame the wild  mane of raven  lochs which fell upon  either shoulder in light waves. The man appeared to be no more than a vagabond. Though he had been tasked with escorting the small caravan upon their journey.
