But much of Cyrili is strung out over small islands connected by ropes and rope bridges, each island dotted with different things. Some with crops of plants or animals that need to be kept separate from others, some with windmills, what have you.Places of interest include the Village Square, which houses both the Town Hall and the tavern-and-inn named the Nine Horse Hitch, as well as being where most of the shops are located. With a well in the center of the little cobblestone area, it's where a lot of people tend to congregate, and where flyers for various goods and services can be found.Town hall is where the mayor and the village council meet, where disputes are settled and official records are kept, and where the village's small jail is located. Where events are hosted such as dances and feasts, it serves as sort of a central meeting hub for the village.. or at least one that's more reputable than the local watering hole.The Nine Horse Hitch is the village's only tavern. Owned and run by Therlyn Valrun and his wife Marilla, it serves home-brewed ales and simple food items. It also has a few rooms to sell upstairs.

Once you free the children, the Resistance will be able to organize, and we'll be able to join you in taking out the militant cultists that are stationed around the town. Our magic doesn't work beyond this point -- Xoilun's cultists have erected a barrier that negates our spells.

In their own tongue one of the Brothers suggested a simple attack from the front, taking a more or less textbook ends justify means approach, executed hostages be damned. They're people, Brother. They're not humans but they're people like you or I. Hansel sighed, hoping against hope that Alaric would not go with the attitudes so common to the Brotherhood. With that Hans looked at those he brought with him.
