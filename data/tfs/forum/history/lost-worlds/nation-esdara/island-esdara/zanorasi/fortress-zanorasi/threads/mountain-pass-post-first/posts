The important nature of this barrier means that it\u2019s constantly manned and often visited by patrols of the flying eagle riders. Only those who have business with the fortress are permitted through the gate.(Anyone trying to access the Fortress of Zanora'si, whether it be by air or on foot, must stop at this gate. Those who are permitted entry will be allowed to pass - those who aren't will either be turned away or escorted, depending upon the reason for their attempted antry. Any who try to pass the gate without stopping will be met with force.)", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/UckmyCI.png"], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/UckmyCI.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/></div>"}}
