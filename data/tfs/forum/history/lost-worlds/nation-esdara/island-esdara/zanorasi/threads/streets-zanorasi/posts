Liv, can you promise me to be just a little more careful with all your work? Yes I know this is out of the blue but I'm just remembering the first few of our meetings, how you had the burnt hair and all. I have you in my mind for the rest of my earthly life. But by the gods, I don't want to lose you, I don't want to be abruptly cut off from you.\" He finished a little weakly with a hint of a slouch. \"I don't want you to think I want to to sto doing what you want to, but there's a boundary to everything.

I'll promise the same thing if it means anything.\"\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "It was extremely satisfying to hear Liv's response, Hansel was at rest that for at least he was not dismissed as a loony and the girl of his (admittedly recent) dreams was at least willing to listen to his plans for the future.
