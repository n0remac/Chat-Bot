The city sprung up around the fortress, where the Zanora riders live and train and work with their mounts. While the military resides within the fortress, those who serve the military reside within the city, providing much-needed services to those who form the nation\u2019s strength. Shops of veritably every kind can be found in this fair-sized town.Places of note include the Wind Rider's Tavern and the Town Hall. This three-story tavern is the town's only tavern and inn and caters almost exclusively to the zanora riders who reside in the fortress. With a few rooms to rent, it serves alcohol of various varieties and a number of hearty, filling dishes.Atop a hill in the town that shows its importance, the town hall serves as the main buffer between the denizens of the town and the fortress up the mountain. The town hall holds the jail and is the courthouse, and is where the town council does their work. Permits required to go through the Mountain Pass gate and up to the Fortress of Zanora'si can be obtained here, as well as contracts to supply the fortress.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/r37lqW6.jpg", "http://i.imgur.com/Sf7wm4i.jpg", "http://i.imgur.com/IXiOTI4.jpg"], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/r37lqW6.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/></div>"}}
