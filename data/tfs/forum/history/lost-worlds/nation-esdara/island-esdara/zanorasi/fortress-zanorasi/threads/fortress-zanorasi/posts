Ever since I was a little girl I've been a terrible shot. My mother is one of the best archers in our entire nation. If one of your riders tossed a coin into the air at 300 paces, she could strike it. You can imagine how embarrassed she was when I was a little girl and accidentally shot myself with a recurve bow. It wasn't pointed at me by the way. To this day no one is sure quite how I managed to do it. I'm not even sure if it's true anymore.
