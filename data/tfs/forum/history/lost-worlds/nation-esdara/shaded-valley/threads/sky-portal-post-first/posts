The powers of the god Esdar prevent magical teleportation into or out of the nation, so any who can't fly yet are seeking to access the islands must go through this portal. A magical pillar adorned with an intricate spiral staircase made of unknown metal and crowned by an archway comprised of the same, stepping through this portal will transport the individual in question up to the island, where they will emerge from the Door to the Lowlands.(All who intend to enter Esdara must post at this thread unless they can fly.
