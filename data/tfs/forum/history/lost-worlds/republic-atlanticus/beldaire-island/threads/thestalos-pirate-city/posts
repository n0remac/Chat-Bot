It once was made of sticks and rocks not too long ago, but a private investor saw the potential and decided to invest in the pirate city. It didn't take long before a pirate crew rose up to take control of the city. Engara and Sampson sit as the leaders of Thestalos. They have created a pit of sin that knew no bounds. Grambling, prostitution, slave trading, and all sorts of other bad stuff went on here.\u00a0Thestalos is well protected at sea by the pirate crews that call this city home and the naval forces of Atlanticus beyond that. Atlanticus has never had much trouble out of the city since Atlanticus was a free trade state and had no reason to bother the pirates. Instead, Atlanticus capitalized off of the pirates that called this place home. Oddly enough, even an Atlantian Angelic church could be found here.The paradise for pirates!", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://www.atomicmoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Assassins-Creed-IV-Black-Flag-Concept.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.atomicmoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Assassins-Creed-IV-Black-Flag-Concept.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}}
