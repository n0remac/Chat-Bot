It wasn't perfect, but it would keep them safe and dry at night. Outside of it, Sampson took some stones and made a fire pit. He had filled it with dry leaves and branches with a few extremely dry logs. All that was left was to find a way to start fire. Sampson would sniff around, probably searching for certain minerals or such that could possibly spark. A few minutes later Sampson returned with two rocks. Sampson began to hit them together over the dry debris. It took a long while, but eventually the dry coconut fuzz would spark. The two took turns puffing, and in moment, they had a fire. For now, Sampson and Engara would call this home. They were exhausted and ready to eat. When the rabbits were ready, the two would eat quickly and go back to their interupted sleep. Hopefully this time they could rest for awhile. As the two headed into the shack, Engara pulled out a small scroll. When it unraveled, it was a flag with a phoenix and a star on it.
