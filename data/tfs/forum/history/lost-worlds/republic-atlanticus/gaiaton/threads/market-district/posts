Signs, clues, evidence must be left behind. I say we split up, go to each of the marked sites and look for tracks while it is still daylight.

His own home gave him those skills, where dangerous creatures were a constant threat. Where working and thinking in just such a manner was often the only thing to save a camp. \"But while we do this, we should have the native warriors watch the town and form an all-encompassing perimeter. The openly guarded areas should be continued to be openly guarded, but even those that are not, the outskirts, the back streets, the homes, should be watched by hidden fighters with the goal of simply observing. Not only for the protection of the people, but so that we can discover whether these beasts move into or out of Gaiaton at any point.

When the man finished, he looked as though he was going to comment on the rather unapologetic way he had attempted to gain customers during what was clearly a meeting of crisis.

It was clear that Akbar was absolutely worshipful of Neferet, extremely loyal, and quick to judge. Was Akbar quick to forgive, however? It remained to be seen. \"She has brought security and organization to Gaiaton with the influence of the Phoenix State, and it is because of this that there is any protection for this city and its people at all.\"The people of Gaiaton were easy going enough to allow physical changes to happen, but things like curfew and rules were harder to enforce, especially without a central police or guard. Neferet had made so many other changes to the city, that she felt as if forcing the citizens into uncomfortable circumstances was not necessary. For three years it had not been necessary until this attack had happened.Opong, who sat through this, cupped his elbows and seemed to rock back on his heels, comfortable to stand there. He wore a cloth over one shoulder that was belted at his narrow, lean waist with gold, and pants of burnt orange that were loose but clasped around his calves with bands of deep purple, decorated with golden and green thread. A large gold earring was at one ear, and an ever present Cat's Smile was on his lips.Akbar's manner had gotten even more stiff since the businessman had arrived, in obvious dislike of Opong's appearance.\"We are not without our hunters and our warriors,\" he said of Krypt and Fenris, who seemed to be treating this situation as if Gaiaton were idiots who didn't know what they were doing. \"We have tracked them, which is how we learned that they must be a beast such as this. The creatures realized what we were doing, and then began to take to the trees, leaving no tracks to follow but those they left when they attacked.\"Once it became clear who and where they were attacking, Neferet ordered the workers to return to Gaiaton at night, but these people are superstitious. They not only believe that someone has stolen from a tomb from the Valley of the Kings, but they believe the road is now cursed and they should not work on it.\"We have searched the jungle. We continue to search the jungle while my numbers dwindle with fear. It as if these creatures disappear. But...\" Akbar had to acknowledge that the idea that these creatures might be WEREcreatures held some merit. \"Perhaps we should begin looking IN the city.\" Akbar rubbed his large hand at his jaw.A glance up at Fenris as he mentioned 150 men, and that they would stay in the jungle. \"That is your folly. The Living Jungle is home to more than just these two beasts.\" Even so, Akbar, who was used to a more war-like style than these relaxed Gaiaton people, was alarmed that an entire 150 men were brought here.The jungle atmosphere was thick, humid, and hot. Plants that looks beautiful and inviting were poisonous, along with its fruit. Venomous animals blended easily with the thick crowding of plants in the jungle, and predators were everywhere in the Living Jungle. Size did not matter; stamina did.Opong finally laughed. \"Do you men actually think that you'll be able to just march into that jungle, find the beasts on a silver platter and slaughter them so easily?\" Opong shook his head and dropped his arms. \"Well, if you do, a free meal on me, hm?\"He turned to Akbar. \"I've come to inform you that Neferet expects your presence at the dinner tonight. Shall I inform her that you'll be bringing guests with you?\"Akbar's eyes were hot on Opong with dislike, but even he felt as if Opong's words rang with some truth. This was not going to be easy, and while Fenris and Krypt's plans so far were sound ones -- they were plans for your average stupid beast. The Guardians were not such beasts.He turned to Fenris and Krypt. \"Tonight, there is a dinner at the Golden Leopard between Neferet and the Council on how to proceed with the road, the safety of the city, and the beasts. Afterwards, there is a memorial service. These are things I must attend, and while I am appreciate of the help you mean to bring, nothing can go forward without Neferet's consent.
