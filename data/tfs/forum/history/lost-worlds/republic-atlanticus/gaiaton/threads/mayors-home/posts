It revealed that these beasts were green because there was moss\u00a0growing on their backs, for the beasts were made of stone.\u00a0Clearly this\u00a0was the reason why they were so devastating-- their claws seemed to shine like gold, as did their maws, but they could not be made solely from gold for they tore into people quite easily.The odd\u00a0thing about this encounter was that neither one of the beasts had yet\u00a0to kill a person. They appeared and the screaming started.

These beasts acted as if they had a mission. These beasts did not seem to truly react as anything more than beasts. And yet... hm. Perhaps they served a master somewhere.
