Now, however, it simply signifies mourning.\"They continued into the wine bar.

A handsome man, his chest naked but for a wide, cerulean blue collar over his shoulders, decorated in gold and green and red, gold cuffs on either rippling bicep, and loose linen pants that were gathered at toned hips came over. His black hair was shaved on the sides of the head, while the top was clearly long and gathered back in a bun at the crown of his head. This hairstyle seemed prominent among the native men of Gaiaton. A pink scar ran from his hair line to his jaw on one side of the face, jagged, but only seemed to add to his beauty.Inam greeted him in Gaia, and he greeted back. A touch of sadness was in her tone as she reached out to lay a hand on his arm. He responded in kind, and laid his hand briefly over hers, and then the touch was gone as Inam turned to Robert and Rafaela.\"This is Tuana, son of Epo.

It cut all conversations and responses short.Neferet turned to those new at the table with the poise of a noble. \"I am Neferet, mayor of Gaiaton, and it was I who sent the messages of need, with the approval of the council.\" She gestured to the Gaiaton locals. \"Lord Inana is Master of Merchants, Master Ona is Master of Mystics,\" he sat beside Oleanna, \"Lord Sonam is Master of Artisans, and Master Tuana is currently sitting as proxy for the Master of Providers.\"She turned her gaze between those who sat there. \"You have all been made aware of the beasts and the trouble and heart ache they have caused Gaiaton.

My hope is that you might all work together.\"\"The attacks have stopped, Neferet,\" Inana said with rol of his eyes as two lovely Gaiaton girls came forward, holding largs baskets.\"We just had attacks last night,\" Akbar reminded the plump merchant.\"Surely now that Neferet has ended work on the road, our men are finally safe,\" smiled Inana. Beside Tuana, one of the servant girls bent over and opened the lid. A faint hissing could be heard, and Tuana looked in the basket. As if picking out a piece of fruit from a market stall, he reached a hand in quickly and snatched a brightly colored snake by its neck. Its body whipped for a moment before his grasp cracked the Snake's neck with practiced movements, and he draped the dead snake over the girl's arm.\"Yes, I'm sure you're very pleased by that,\" said Master Ona, lifting a hand to stroke his beard as Sonam chose and killed his own snake, while the second girl moved to Akbar. Akbar killed two, and then the baskets moved towards the foreigners. If they looked inside, they would see writhing snakes upon each other.\"It was a terrible idea. Gaiaton doesn't need new roads.\"\"You mean, you don't want foreign traders,\" replied Tuana.\"We don't need any more foreigners, \" Inana responded. \"Unless its to kill the beasts, I'm sure.\" Inana looked at Krypt, and raised his cup. \"My money is on you.\"Akbar scoffed, but kept his opinion to himself.\"This is not a game, Lord Inana,\" Neferet said. \"Pray that tonight is a night without attack.

She turned and looked at Oleanna. \"This way,\" she comme.ted with a tilt of her head.The theatre was reminiscent of Roman ampitheatres, set up in much the same way, but the pillars for illumination and the braziers that hung from them were distinctly Gaiaton in style. The booths for the wealthy were there in front of the stage, not above them, and gilded with gold and precious stones, like lapiz and turquoise and rose quartz.A curtain hung across the stage, once more cerulean, a color that Oleanna had seen on Neferet, and painted in broad strokes in a temporary swath of color over doorways, much in the way the Hebrews brushed lambs blood over their doors during the final plague of Egypt. The curtain was decorated with illuminating figures that must have been people on earth, kings perhaps, mourning a dead brother, and a god lifting him into the sky with great celebration.Neferet led Oleanna to sit in one of the booths with cushions for comfort. The jungle night was very, very warm, and no shawls or cloaks were needed. They sat there, with an ability for polite conversation, until some of the sconces and braziers were let out and the pan pipes of the troop of musicians began.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Neferet made it through the people, her naked shoulders stiff even though she was trying to look as serene and welcoming as she usually did. Although there was reverence in most people's eyes, she saw anger and blame and malice in others.

But slowly Oleanna picks up on Neferet's mood and pieces together that they blame the mayor for not foreseeing the attack.\"What a bunch of bloody morons.\"Oleanna seaths silently thinking of both the mayor and the angry people. You weren't supposed to know your own future yet these people had someone thay let them sneak a peek. Then they get upset just because she missed something? That was like being angry at the goose who laid the golden egg because it laid a normal one. That was how things were supposed to be no use crying about it. The knight almost says something but fortunately she then remembers that grieving people can be irational. \"Can't blame them for wanting something to blame even if they choose the wrong target.\"As Oleanna thinks this she let's out a calming breath and follows Neferet inside. As they sit Oleanna tries to think of a conversation topic to distract Neferet. The mayor was a building bundle of tension and some casual conversation may help. Unfortunately Oleanna was very bad at casual conversation. More accurately she was bad at the kind of casual a women like Neferet would appreciate. Oleanna could talk all day about weapons and battle and tactics, and at night she could get rather bawdy. All of which seemed like a bad play. Eventually Oleanna says hesitantly.\"So uhmm Neferet what is Gaiaton like... Uh normally?\"Yup Oleanna thinks to herself this is awkward.
