Historically, they have worked quite closely with the Temple of Wisdom and the Peaceful Way, and now that the Angel of Amun Ra has its presence in Gaiaton, some of their priests come to host classes as well.The professors and teachers at the College of Gaiaton focus on the sciences, especially those of a biological or astronomical persuasion given their proximity to the Living Jungle and the Heavens above. They have incredible courses on Medicine on Surgery that seem almost mystical.They have extraordinary courses on Mathematics, Physics and Engineering, of which the people of Gaiaton are some of the best, once more given the difficult environment that they have not just conquered, but completely enveloped.The Campus is always awake, and there is always someone to speak to.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/ru8VsS5.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ru8VsS5.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/></div>"}}
