Multiple cultures are easily seen in the architecture of this beautiful temple, where white-draped, bald monks still walk and live and eat and learn and teach the Peaceful Ways.Although only honored guests may stay the night at the Temple of Wisdom, the Monks are more than happy to share their wisdom with any who are interested; whether it be the Wisdom of the Hand that studies art and calligraphy and the peace one may find, whether it be the Wisdom of the Foot that studies martial arts and trials of the body for peace, or the Wisdom of the Mind that studies languages, history, and science for peace.To be a true Master of the Peaceful Ways, one must become a Master of the Hand, Foot, and Mind, and it is a long journey. Great Master Waru is the current Master of the Peaceful Ways, and is a very busy man. It is unlikely many will get to see him, but there are other Monks and Masters that will help a questing soul or restless mind.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/qR6NwC8.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/qR6NwC8.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/></div>"}}
