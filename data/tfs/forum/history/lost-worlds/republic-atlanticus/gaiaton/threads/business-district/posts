The other shoulder and arm was left bare, a golden cuff around her upper arm and her usual jangling bangles around each wrist. A bright turquoise sash was around her waist, accentuating her balanced and hourglass figure. Flora was trimmed around the skirt of her dress, climbing up her thighs, and a small train trailed after her. A gauzy, see-through scarf was pinned at the back of her head with a golden comb, covering her long dark hair that hung like black silk down her back. The tattoos of her Ma'hati Tribe were easily seen on her other arm.\"Robert, hello. Rasha told you?\" she asked, guiding him into her office and shutting the door behind him. She gave Robert such a grateful and hopeful look, that it was enough to break hearts.\"Oh, Robert. Thank you. I could kiss you.\" But she wouldn't, of course. She'd never touched Robert, not even to tell him his future. He'd never asked for it, and Neferet never offered it at a service, although she never declined anyone who asked. \"The Foreman of the road project has just informed me that he is quitting, and the workers are all quitting.
