Using matches, she struck the flame on the inside. She picked up the pouch with the yellow dot, opened it, and sprinkled dry herbs inside. The scent of spice was immediately strong, pale green smoke curling from out of the holes of the metal things.She reached for the second pouch, this one marked with a red dot, and opened it. She put two fingers inside, and pulled them out again, the tips stained blue. Closing her eyes, she marked a line, horizontally over her forehead, as if that line represented a shut eye. She closed the pouch, then put both back into the box.Lastly, she reached for the knife and when she turned one of her palms over, Krypt would be able to see an old and ugly scar upon it, as if she had done this over... and over... and over again, the skin thickened and a darkened pink. He could see it in her face, the way she tensed, her shoulders as well, and she split her palm open down that line so that blood came to the surface against the caramel hue of her skin.Then, she lifted those tawny eyes to his, and purposefully put the small knife on his side of the table.
