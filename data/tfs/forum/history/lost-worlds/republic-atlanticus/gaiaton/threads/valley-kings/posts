It was said that the custom of the Kings was to begin building their resting place in a mountain as soon as their crown touched their foreheads, for it would take a long time to make the labyrinth of rooms and halls as beautiful as fit a King in death.They lined them with gold and wealth, and booby trapped all of it so that they may rest in peace. It is rumored that each King of Gaiaton had their Magus create a unique guardian for each mountain, to make sure their tombs were never disturbed.Is any of this real? It's hard to say.

However Inana was not the only one with a trick up his sleeve, and he had seemed to forget or not had noticed the fragment of liquid silver shadow beneath the merchant and under the stone itself. Something had changed, were more people on there way to this forsaken place? As if to answer his query he saw Neferet and Krypt dragged in, along with Rafaela, he seemed to be the only one not being held down. He had to play along now. A wrong move and both women might end up dead as a ritual began as the circle of guardians formed. \"Get it yourself.\" he said glaring at the possessed merchant. He was not about too do this mans bidding, if he could even still be called as such.What Krypt had not realized was that despite his \"destiny\" that did not mean that his actions might not result in the deaths of others. Even so, the sudden lumbering forward of the Brute might give Fenris an opening, providing a distraction.
