The blubber is rendered down into oil for lamps, the hide is tanned into warm, waterproof leather, the meat is cooked and sold to low-end restaurants, and the milk is used for cream. It's all very efficient. Even the bones are saved, to be given to dogs or carved into spearheads.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/3b3edE1.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/3b3edE1.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/>"}, "post-15549": {"user": "Grand Komtur: Giplor Vauc'Tutt", "user_num": 648, "timestamp": "1447369577000", "message": "The local government had decided that with the rise in demand for Seals. The farming had been doing great, but what else could they do with them? The decision was simple, sell them to the state government for military purposes. They could make high profits off a low cost creature.A man in a silver and blue suit went to each farm and delivered a letter. In this letter they explained their ideas. They hoped that the farmers would do such a thing. The letter stated the following informations:How many seals they would like to purchase.What the seals would be used for.The tax credits that would almost make their taxes 0 if they met the demand.And what their intentions for the profits raised off the seals.Where the seals would go for training.Information on a local grant for anyone interested in Walrus farming. Atlanticus wanted to make the most they could off of the eastern border that was primarily lakes. Some lakes were cold and others hot; even better some were salt, some brackish, and some were fresh.They hoped that by being completely honest that the locals would agree to such. They made the promise that any seal farmer could participate and become a State Approved Seal Farm, which meant that the State itself could only purchase seals from them.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The local government had decided that with the rise in demand for Seals.

The state wants to buy the seals? What for? Town meetings are held, and get very heated. Old men complain, saying that selling to the government would take the soul out of the seal farming business, and that farming walruses is just absurd. Their younger counterparts argue that the government deal would allow them to expand and prosper, and with government funding walrus farms could be a viable source of cheap ivory. After much discussion, 37 of the 48 farms decide to take government contracts, while the other 11 choose to continue working as private entities. Within a month, the first shipment of seals is sent to the secret training camp, on a heavily guarded wagon. Two small children wave as they go.\"What's going to become of the seals, father?\"Their father scratches his chin.\"I don't know, kids. They're not going to eat them, not at that price. I think they're going to train them for...something. Now go feed the seals.\"Grumbling, the kids run off to do their chores, throwing fish to young seals so their fur grows lustrous and their blubber gets thick.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "As always, there is some suspicion.

For every twelve Archaniox Rhinos, there was three of the large containers. As the containers came closer, they'd notice the seels that were more beefed up than ever seen before. With them was a large Walrus. They all seemed to float in an exact spot, all trained to keep a position.The caravan went straight into town and stopped to display them. They wanted to show everyone what the seels had become. They were well trained to a military code that only them and their masters would know. With no serious enemies, they were used in place of the ships to cover and report the oceans beyond their reach. One could say they were the scouts of the Navy.Armored guards got out of periodic steel carriers pulled by Archaniox Rhinos. They were to protect the caravan until it reached the farms.
