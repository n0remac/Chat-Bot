There was a newcomer and they swore to proctect this border. It didn't take long before the right creatures made their presence. First a walrus broke through the ice on the water. He wore an Officers hat and had a cob pipe. Next were two seals who came out of the hole, placing a seal on each side of the walrus. The seals wore white hats and necklaces nade from blue stones. Then four penguins made their presence. One hopped out of the hole, doing flips as he landed in front of the Walrus. The penguin squacked and three black dots could be seen on a nearby glacier that was near the chunk of ice the others were on. The three penguins barreled down the glacier on their bellies, angled themselves to skid across the top of the water, and popped right up on the chunk of ice with the others in karate like stances. Obviously these animals weren't normal. They looked at Wehr and began to use their primal senses to try and feel him out.The walrus would let out a mighty voice, \"What do you want?! Breaking through glaciers doesn't make you seem to friendly!\"The group of animals waited for a response in their Ginyu Force style posing.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "A large roar of sound erupted from the animals who called this place home.
