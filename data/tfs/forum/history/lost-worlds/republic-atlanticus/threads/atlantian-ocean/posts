The fleet consisted of nine Warhammer Battleships and one Kiraxo Royal Air Force Carrier. Their hulls were made of Drumbar Steel plating, allowing it to repel and take on much more damage than average ships. Runed with Despelling magic that is not Anti-Magic, but does prevent magic from having any effects after connection. This meant magic could be used on and around the ship, magic just could not come in contact with the Drumbar Steel plating. Their decks and all other wood structures pertaining to the ship were made of Cedar. Cedar was known for many things. The marking of a sacred location as these ships were their life, cleansing a negative atmosphere that pushes for highest morale and prime strategists. Due to the woods ability to survive, they had adopted the belief that Cedar gave longevity, protection, and preservation. Not only these effects occurred, but the Cedar was beautiful. Reinforced with normal chains that ran through the wood from side to side so many feet, it gave the Cedar deck a stronger base to prevent a full collapse.The weaponry on these ships were magnificent. They hailed twenty-four ballista on each side that were explosive tipped. On top, the Aquamancers and Cryomancers lined the sides. The two were preparing themselves, taking control of the water whether it was for ice or water strikes. The ballista were loading and the runed tips were being activated. One could see the magic at work here and it looked like it was ready for vengeance.On the nine Warhammer Battleships, the half-elves were at command. Their cryomancers and aquamancers wore different armor than the other seamen on the ship. Their uniform was that of a warrior while the others were standard naval Dress White uniform. Every man had his position and they were there. Scouts looked from the Crow's Nests while the Cryomancers  and Aquamancers scowered the waters like a hawk, sensing any abnormalities in it as far as they could see; large enough motion would disturb the control and alert them of underwater attacks.The Kiraxo Royal Air Force Carrier ship was a massive ship that stretched four times the size of the Warhammer Battleships. This ship did not carry much weaponry, but what it had was enough to defend long enough to get away. It carried the same materials for it's design as the Warhammer's, but inside it was large bays with Anti-Fire runes. Inside these bays were about thirty lesser dragons from the Kiraxo Royal Air Force that Atlanticus trained for sea battle. This ship was controlled by the Kiraxo Royal Air Force that like many of the Phoenixian forces, was a dragonoid species that was taking over the Isolated cities and protecting the half elves, letting them live instead of fear. Something they hoped to extend back into their homeland with the help of Atlanticus. Beyond the horizon was another force of ships coming, but this fleet was order to remain behind the Warhammer Brigade until the signal was given to proceed. Atlanticus was devout when it came to striking down tyranny and helping others. The Atlantians understood the history of the Dragonoids due to the Phoenixians, and the Atlantians wanted to show them that not all humanoids were alike. Each captain of each ship had a rune that was connected to another, when activated it could carry messages through mental flow. Communication was key for success since they were breaking into new waters with limited intel and wanting to invade. They had the fleet to do it, they just needed to function precisely and timely. Once the ships reached a point, the dragonoid spoke first, \"Prepare for engagement. We are in their territory. If we win, we will be be able to land and make it into the jungle to set up camp. Keep a sharp eye out.\"Watching is what they were doing. All the ships fell into a formation, place the Air Carrier in the center, allowing it to watched by every ship and prevent being the first one out. With every inch they moved, they knew they were one more inch to being face to face with an enemy that they barely knew.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "A large and glorious fleet of ships could be seen glistening in the ocean like large diamonds.

They are reptilian humanoids who share a kinship bond with dragons. But unlike their diminutive cousins, the Kiraxans are far more powerful and deadly. Their sordid past led them to conceal themselves from more recent history. All that can be said as of yet is that their relationship with humans is that of a complicated rivalry.A great tyrant has risen among them, a tyrant who, like the other Kiraxans, embodies \"the will of nature\". However, his particular brand of the \"will of nature\" focuses mostly on natural selection and might equals right. His machinations are unknown, but they do not bode well for the future of the majority of Kiraxans.Their naval base is a couple of miles away from the barrier that keeps their territory hidden. It is an odd site from a distance, appearing to be great grey bubbles on the island. Should enemy ships cross the barrier and somehow be able to spot what is actually happening on the coast, with telescopes or magical means, they would see Kiraxan slaves being mercilessly worked to death. Runes and spells would float ominously in the air around the large grey domes, gradually shifting colors for an unknown purpose.\u00a0Crucial to Kiraxan naval construction, including the base, is a variation of pumice stone that has been forged with magic. Filled with air bubbles, strange little crystals, and networks of magically enhanced tiny organisms, this \"stone\" is light enough to float in water and incredibly sturdy. It is also self-repairing. Minor cracks mean nothing to it. Only large holes cannot be repaired so easily. A good chunk of the slave labor force would be seen harvesting and modifying this stone.Both their surface and underwater vessels are constructed with this stone.\u00a0The Kiraxans command several dozen underwater vessels.\u00a0They are hydrodynamically designed with polished surfaces to prevent drag. They are shaped like manta rays, their grey \"wings\" able to move and flex and power them through the water. These vessels are also equipped with magical swim bladders below the ship which expand and contract to modify buoyancy. The gas can be rendered extremely volatile using a built-in magic spell, so in a pinch these mantas can enter a suicide run and ram enemy ships from below while detonating the gas. However, their primary offensive weapon is the Firestone Cannon. This cannon consists of a six point star which is isolated from the rest of the vessel by a magically insulating material. There is a chamber inside containing a special rock known as a Firestone. When the Firestone comes in contact with the magical pumice, it release a powerful charge of magical energy which passes through the pumice and releases in the form of a deadly stream of fire magic. Each shot can bore a hole into a wooden hull like butter. The cannon can fire in six different directions or straight up, but can only fire one direction at a time.\u00a0That said they are given a slight range of movement from sitting on a platform that can tilt a few degrees in any direction.\u00a0These cannons can only fire from above water.The several dozen surface vessels come in two classes: Serpent class and Turtle class. The Serpent class appears, unironically, like a giant serpent. It propels itself across the water using powerful undulations of its whole body. Oddly enough these vessels move fastest while traveling sideways along the water instead of straight ahead. Their undulating movements make them difficult to hit, but their shots are not very accurate while moving.They are equipped with two cannons each, one close to the head and one close to the tail. These ships have two pilots each.The Turtle class is essentially a barge, designed with an attached long tail as well as a system of dozens of oars. These ships can continue to move while taking major damage. There are four Firestone cannons on each of these ships, one on each corner. The ships feature heavily armed and armored boarding parties with magical long range weapons, especially a type of crossbow which can be loaded with multiple rounds of a strange glowing crystal. These crystals are incredibly sharp and will splinter when they hit something too solid, releasing deadly shrapnel sprayed all over the place.Typically there are three types of Kiraxan troops. There are the Arians, Kiggies, and Sitons. Sitons are large, chubby toad-like reptilians who primary serve as pilots. They are rarely seen in open combat. The kiggies are fast, raptor-like reptilians with narrow heads and bodies. They are incredibly fast and vicious and will literally tear apart their prey with sharp claws if they lose their weapons. Finally there are the Arians, human-like reptilians who stand eight feet tall. They are strong and fast (though not quite as fast as the Kiggies) and serve as tactical leaders. They carry bladed gauntlets in addition to their weapons and are experts in melee combat. All three types of troops possess excellent hearing and sight, as well moderate thermal sensing ability.Boarding parties consist of both Arians and Kiggies. When all the Arians die, Kiggies will sometimes become confused and exhibit erratic behavior. Boarding parties normally use hooks attached to ropes to board ships, or bare claws to climb up the hull. However Arians and Kiggies are so athletic that they have been known to occasionally\u00a0leap onto ships.All Kiraxan vessels have their weaknesses. Should the surface of the hulls of any ship take too much damage, the porous structure creates friction in the water and slow them down while they repair. Turtle class vessels don't slow down due to friction as much, but they can be crippled if all their oars and tail are removed.\u00a0In the case of underwater mantas, if the gas bladder is destroyed for whatever reason, the manta must either remain underwater or release buoyancy stones to remain at the surface. Here they cannot move properly. Again, Firestone Cannons can only fire above water.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<i>Beyond the barrier, beyond the unexplored but amiable looking facade of water, lies the Kiraxan civilization.<br><br/>The Kiraxans are not unlike kobolds.
