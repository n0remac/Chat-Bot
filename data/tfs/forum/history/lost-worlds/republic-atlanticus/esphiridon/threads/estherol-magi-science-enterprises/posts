The structure is made from white marble , the roof of a 1/2 steel plating, and the windows made of a magic crystal. Around the homes exterior, one will find multiple porches, decks, and a pool. There were many guards that surrounded this building and the surrounding magical property.The property is finely maintained and the ponds were stocked well with various species of fish. These ponds were enchanted to create different ecosystems allowing them to have rare and unknown species. One pond even has Sirens that act a security system. Due to a surgery given to them by Firgov himself, they lost their seductive magic and are just a noise to alert.Roaming the property are various creatures with magical items that allow communication with the humanoids. These creatures would normally be untrainable, but due to the bonding magic LTS had with the land, Firgov and his partner developed an equation that allowed them to alter parts of its magical structure to be used to connect animals and humanoids.\u00a0Everything that lives here is thankful for their peaceful lives and live as one. Although there was a food chain, Humanoids sat at the top. A beautiful property with magnificent creatures and magics. Any person with no intent to harm could visit the lands, camp, fish, and do whatever. Firgov had invested a lot of gold into this Enterprise and it could be seen for miles to come as you passed through the foothills.Inside the structure is a very unkempt place with a massive library and magical items everywhere. Books were stacked everywhere and people seemed to be reading them. These books were from all over the Overworld that talked about magic or science. The library seems to constantly grow as the two partners are always wanting to stay one step ahead. There was lots of value in the Magi-Science field and the possibilities were limitless.If one had any normal business, they would be sent to a small office up a flight of stairs. You will be greeted by a small Pit Kiraxan(shokan). This person knew nothing of the science lab or what went on, they were just there to take orders new trinkets, spells, weaponry, and whatever other magical contraptions people wanted. \u00a0Somewhere inside the business layer is a magical passage to the laboratories. Firgov's laboratory was magnificent, \u00a0hosting a library with every book perfectly placed, his floors had a honeycomb design made of Blue Ozmodian Iron look with a black abyss below it. Between the metals design was a glowing blue magic. Should anyone with antimagic or despelling magic enter this room, they would fall into the abyss.\u00a0The stone that the walls were made of were finely crafter and magic seemed to radiate from engravings found on them. Four pillars stood near the center of the room, each a different color. Inside them were beings from the Overworld, or what looked like them. The mixture of science and magic was overwhelming and what could be found here were not meant to be let loose in the Overworld.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_RWfU7lXeSYEj1qY2w-RDL7z6SM=/800x450/filters:focal(34x0:1415x1036)/cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/47933019/12410_COVE_LN_74561_123_9112014RS.0.jpg", "https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/82/2c/2a/822c2afbed8d7dc6df91fcf1b9f2d19e.jpg", "https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/c0/91/10/c091109b9938c1389d79aee953575128.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_RWfU7lXeSYEj1qY2w-RDL7z6SM=/800x450/filters:focal(34x0:1415x1036)/cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/47933019/12410_COVE_LN_74561_123_9112014RS.0.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/></div>"}, "post-37386": {"user": "Firgov Estherol", "user_num": 429, "timestamp": "1463030631000", "message": "Firgov hovered over a magical table that hovered between the four runed stones that produced it. On it was a blue magic vial, a piece of bronze, and a piece of amethyst. In Firgov's hands were two wands; one was iron and the other was wooden. On his face he had a face mask made of enchanted glass that was shatterproof. The mask did have a few light scorches, but nothing serious.\"If this...\" Firgov mumbled to himself before being cut off.A bolt of energy surged through his body causing his hair to rise and his body shook rapidly. The energy surged from the blue magic vial into the iron wand that was dipped into it. After passing through his body and into the amethyst stone, one could see the blue magic inside the stone.\u00a0Firgov shook off the shock and started the next step. He took his wands and used a levitation spell on the stone and the bronze. As soon as they were off the table and a few feet apart, Firgov would throw them into the open space of the test room. About twelve feet away, the two slammed into each other and an orb of electricity exploded around the materials. The electricity strike was large due to the mass of bronze he used and the size of the amethyst stone.\u00a0The amethyst exploded into thousands of pieces no bigger than a grain of sand and the bronze fell to the floor. The bronze itself still sparked with electricity and had to be neutralized. He would slide a leather glove on his right hand and touch the bronze with his iron wand to neutralize it before he picked it up and set it on the table.\u00a0\"Note to self, Nature overpowers magic, even when dealing with electricity.\" Firgov spoke to himself as he straightened out his hair before indulging into another part.Firgov added a substance to the magic that turned it into a liquid substance that he would remove with a dropper. The magical properties were all the same, the magic itself was now in a physical form much like a potion. Firgov took the dropper and released a couple drops on the bronze, but nothing occurred.\u00a0\"This marvels me! The magic is not the absolute reason. It will require the Amethyst as a host... This is too costly to invest in. Alchemy is very possible... I wonder if I can derive an alchemic equation to convert quartz into amethyst, even if only for seconds..the alchemy would allow them to carry it and choose when to activate it...\" Firgov whispered to himself.Firgov would leave the table and exit the test room. He would appear back in his main lab and go straight to his desk. After pulling a stack of paper material and his ink and feather, he would begin writing symbols, scribbling math equations, writing chants. While doing so, on anther piece of paper his other hand was putting it together and making proper sense out of the jibberish his mind was pumping out through his right hand. When the jibberish was done, Firgov would begin a long series of trial and errors till he could get the alchemic seal he needed for his idea to work.Every so often he would life his head up and look around for inspiration. Firgov focused a lot on the beings in the tubes around him, as well as the other various things that lurked behind these magically closed doors. Every so often he would hear a subtle thump and whine, but he seemed to ignore it until specific times of the day. It would be hours, if not days, before Firgov had his first seal. Once the first seal is made can the final seal could be found. This same seal could also have Firgov put in jail in many other places as they would think he was to produce fake valuables; one of many reasons he chose Atlaticus.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Firgov hovered over a magical table that hovered between the four runed stones that produced it.
