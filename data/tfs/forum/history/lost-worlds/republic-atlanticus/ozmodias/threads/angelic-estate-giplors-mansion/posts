One will find all sorts of flowers and trees on his property. It is a very serene and modest place that is more of a Home than a Mansion.\u00a0InsideThe interior of Giplor's Mansion is dressed with a sea style. Everything in this mansions interior design was related to the ocean and seas in one, way, shape, or form. One thing that stood out was the dome above that had a picture of a Merman and a Woman holding hand. The woman seemed to be hanging over a cliff with fear in her eyes while the Merman was being pulled to the depths with anger in his. This painting was a story itself that came from the natives of Carmela Island who converted to them without hesitation, their primitive native american styles looking upon the soldiers like they were gods.If one ever wants to know the tale, they have to ask Giplor. He is the only known being left with the knowledge on the immaculate painting. \u00a0Other than the painting, one would find arts and treasures related to the ocean that was found during the campaigns on this land.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://entertainment.suntimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/FairyCastle_front-980x600.jpg", "http://www.wilsonassociates.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/AtlantisBahamas_2.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://entertainment.suntimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/FairyCastle_front-980x600.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/>"}, "post-32810": {"user": "William, John, and Paul", "user_num": 884, "timestamp": "1460415121000", "message": "\"If we are so broke why don't we find work?\" Paul had been badgering his teacher the whole walk. \"We could do one job and it would make the search a lot easier.\" \"The Path will lead us where we need to be.\"  William gave the same answer he had been giving.
