Despite the names, they're very friendly people, and excellent salesmen. Besides the usual (food, supplies, weapons) Jackal and Shank's also sells all sorts of luxury goods, imported through the Northwest Trading Company. It's known for its beautiful silks, delicious wine, shiny gems, and delectable candy, which is imported from an old man in the Free City.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/F7mzOMA.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/F7mzOMA.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}}
