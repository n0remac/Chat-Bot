Judging that even if she were a murderess she'd avoid attacking someone in this crowded of a space, he felt secure enough to remove his helmet. He promptly tucked it under his arm.Edyrian watched the healers work. He had seen a fair share of wounds, himself. It was clear to him that this man would likely be scarred for life, and he'd be lucky to get away without permanent muscle damage. Fate was cruel to some.He turned his attention away and listened to the buzz of conversation around him. Serial killings, laments for the dead, the foreign nature of the woman, family troubles, and other such things bathed over him. Serial killings, eh? Perhaps he could be of assistance.His silent, detached information gathering was interrupted as his focus shifted. That strange woman had gotten up and was heading over to the injured man. Her features were ever-so-slightly different, a somewhat inhuman slant to her facial structure. While curious, he decided that the best way to get answers was to not interfere, to see what she would do.Her actions took him completely by surprise, yet again. She pressed herself onto the man and locked her lips with his. Forgetting the decision he had made mere moments earlier, Edyrian started forward with the intent to pull her off.\u00a0The magic inside her seemed to flare, and the man's injuries began to shrink and seal. By now completely flabberghasted, his feet stopped carrying him forward. Definitely best to sit back and watch, now. In a matter of moments, the man was completely healed.A chord sparked in the rusty attic of his memory. She certainly wasn't human; the shift to her features had made that plain. Was there a legend of a creature that could heal through a kiss? He felt as if there was, but the information floated just out of his grasp. He'd have to look it up later.Whatever the case, this relevation somewhat explained her earlier behavior. She seemed unfamiliar with some basic human niceties, but how far did that extend?As he watched her return to the fire, the knight considered the irony. His life centered around the pursuit and oftentimes removal magical beings, and here was one he was unfamiliar with. This one, unlike most he ran into in his profession, seemed relatively... friendly wasn't necessarily the word, but she certainly didn't seem evil or possessed of the intent to harm others. No, considering her display, it was quite the opposite.Judging from her ealier outfit's noticeable lack of purse or pockets (or cloth), she was likely suffering from a distinct lack of coin. He was far from rich, but he could certainly afford a meal or two.Resting his spear on his shoulder, he weaved across the room, heading to the hearth. He considered getting her attention with a tap on the shoulder, but his paranoia was far too ingrained for any sort of physical contact with a mysterious being possessed of unknown magic, as nonthreatening as it may be.
