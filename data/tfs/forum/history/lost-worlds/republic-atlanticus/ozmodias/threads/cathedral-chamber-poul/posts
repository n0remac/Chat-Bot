Every square inch of it is part of a\u00a0mosaic. With the finest stained glass makers and tile makers at hand to do such a thing, the flaws were limited. There is at least one tile or piece of glass for every color on the chart.\u00a0The belief is that the Angel of Amun Ra walks as the Poul's reflection in mosaic. Very few know where it is actually at in the Cathedral, but all the knights, priests, and paladins know. The actual elements and minerals in the tiles and glass would make the room worth at least two thousands pounds of gold.\u00a0Holy Magic is very present in this room and it is protected by Prophets who are it's last resort. Do not expect to be able to barge right in and claim it, there's a reason why the Prophets are locked away in this chamber.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://kickassthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/tumblr_mzijp5U62n1ro74x3o1_1280.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://kickassthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/tumblr_mzijp5U62n1ro74x3o1_1280.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}}
