That reason would allow her to have true freedom in the world; Pharaoh Zaltos Kiraxo walked this world doing as he pleased, and those that were close to him could do the same. This Limitless Freedom was definitely not something he would tell Nereida, it was the only thing he could not offer her. Giplor would then decide to give a simple smile towards Nereida as he lifted his right hand to find the center of her lower back, \"As I told you much earlier in the day, all I can do is prove to you what I offer. Just have faith in me and don't leave because it doesn't progress as fast as you want.\"He'd softly rub her lower back if she'd allow him and look up to Trogdor, \"If you'd like a much better spot to rest, we have Gravlor's Yard on the Angelic Estate. You'll be able to see it without a problem. Lot's of grass with blue and silver flowers and other various plants. I'd love to stay and chat, but I have to check in to the Angelic Estate.

Giplor was not hard to get along with. He understood some creatures were ignorant and think high of themselves. There was no way for Trogdor to simply take the precious materials alone. The immaculate carriage would have to be take whole, the chains holding the horses to the carriage as Trogdor consumed it.These horses had no option for escape. Trogdor would consume the horses along with the carriage, leaving Giplor to watch his horses as they stared at him for help. The chains that bound the creatures were extremely strong and durable due to their enchantments so that the massive horses couldn't escape. Giplor would feel a deep sorrow within his heart, as he loved animals. If Trogdor ate the horses, Giplor was no longer worried about their value, but the bond he had built with them over the years. Watching them die was like watching children die. Despite the sadness, Giplor showed no physical change or expressions as he watched the tragedy of the situation.\u00a0This dragon had simply made a fool of Giplor. There was no way around such a feat. He had justified the dragons consumption of a man and this blatant disrespect was how he repaid him? Trogdor knew that consuming a man wasn't welcomed anywhere in the world and Giplor blew it off, offering no consequence to the feat. Everything had came to a boil, from the destruction of Robert's mansion, the consumption of a man without justification, and his carriage that cost a fortune to build.Giplor was going to show this fire dragon that he is in a land of water and that he could not be an ass here; that he would follow the rules or leave. \u00a0Giplor was the Governor and Grand Komtur of the Brothers of the Sword, while also being the High Paladin of the Atlantian Angelic Order. He did not have these positions because he was weak and let humanoids or creatures walk upon him like he was a bug beneath their feet. All these thoughts and emotions, swelled by the feeling of strength and empowerment that Nereida seemed to cast upon him with her presence.From the moment Trogdor decided to touch the carriage , Giplor began his work. He said nothing to Trogdor, he simply smiled at the dragon. His right hand continued to massage the small of Nereida's back as if he was fine with it. But what would soon follow would show that everything was not as calm as they thought. What was working itself in the background was making it's presence. The time it took Trogdor to consume the carriage was ample time to ready himself.Giplor would never drop his smile as he spoke to Trogdor, \"You deserve a taste of the Atlantic Ocean. It'll wash my carriage and horses down great.\"\u00a0Trogdor's location to consume the carriage would place himself between Giplor and the Atlantic Ocean. Since the day was still early, most people were on the docks and along the water. The entire mansions staff had already scrambled to safety after Trogdor landed. Those along the water could see the water moving, allowing them a few seconds to get out of the way to stare in awe. The water would rise over the seawalls and into the streets. As the water reached over the seawall, the amounts of water would begin to rush over like a reverse waterfall, very little actually spraying into the air as it made the quick angle change. The force of the water would not let up, increasing as it rushed down the street Giplor and Nereida took to get her. The water rushed and the closer it got, the more it would roar. Trogdor would probably have a hard time hearing this due to the crunch of the metals and Pearls. What was rushing at Trogdor was a magically formed river that seemed to cause little damage to the buildings it slapped up against. \u00a0Giplor lifted his left hand nine inches from his form, his finger tips appearing to support his chin. The next part of the illusion was Giplor's hand slamming into a fist and his knuckles finding the point where his fingertips once resided in the air in front of Giplor. It appeared as though Giplor punched himself in the chin from the view of Trogdor if he seen it. Regardless, there was more to it, he was pulling masses of water four blocks at a fast rate. It was a hand sign taught to him by a ninja like race in Titania.

She moaned quietly against his lips, and just that little sound of want likely sent a thrill through him, followed by the hot, wet, teasing touch of her tongue tracing his bottom lip.Her fingers were in his hair, gripping, anchoring him with a surprising strength that belied the delicate, feminine beauty she had exuded... perhaps a reminder that who he held in his arms was capable of being his most beautiful dream, or his worst nightmare.Her lips finally lifted and parted from his as she lowered back down onto the flat of her bare feet, her delicious body sliiiding\u00a0down his chest as she did, the grip of her fingers relaxing in his hair as her arms came loose from around his neck, hands drifting down to rest on his chest.A sense of vitality\u00a0and virility\u00a0was super-charged into Giplor's system from this one kiss. He had no aches or wounds to heal, so the magic of her touch instead boosted what was already there; a heady and addictive taste of magic and woman and mystery all in one.

Lost, and weak, and vulnerable, and dependent on her touch, her taste, the sound of her voice as she thrilled at being pleasured, at giving pleasure. It was dangerous-- a danger that had nothing to do with her own strength or her own violence.

His thumb placed itself on the top of her hip while the fingers and palm rested right above her cheek. His right hand seemed to help support her hold by pulling her chest against his, allowing her arms to take a tighter grip without having to sustain herself. The tighter the hold she had on him, the more he seemed to enjoy it.And then it all slipped away. He felt her arms loosen and her body want to lower. As she released, he would do the same. His hands would find their way to her hips, his thumbs gently massaging the front of her hips. He felt amazing, the glee of a child and the masculinity of king. Such a feeling could go either way; submission to nirvana or hunger for power.He'd then look at the mansion after she spoke before turning back to her, \"Yeah. We need to get to my home...\" Giplor would then think of the kiss once more with the mix of the night before smiling and speaking, \"Man will bow to you one day... I pity those who dare tempt your wrath...\" Closing his thoughts on the passion and the way she made him feel, much less how quick the mightiest of kings would fall to her spell.
