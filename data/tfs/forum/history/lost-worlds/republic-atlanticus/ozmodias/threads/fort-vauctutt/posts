Constantly he beat himself up for being here so long while knowing what his people were dealing with. Even with such pain, Vengelixo kept his composure and was kind; his wrath he would hold for the Kirastix Loyalists. The Kiraxan was a very tall and muscular being who naturally was size of an armored knight, so to keep from becoming too big, he wore an armor that would almost seem to be bound to his body. What skin could be seen between the armor plates covering the uppertorso, arms, and legs, was a material that was skin tight, flexible, had pores for breathing, and looked like leather. Every aspect of his muscle was visible and his armor was highly unique, especially the armor plates with runes that had their purpose.The wind would carry one with the tide, rustling his deep blue cape that notably carried the symbol for the The Brotherhood of Atlanticus and the Atlantian Angelic belief. His blue and tarnished silver armor glistened in the sunlight, casting it benevolent presence on Vengelixo's form. Not to mention the unique helm that was a crown of its own, a helm only fit for a king. After hours of staring out over the Atlantis Ocean, Vengelixo decided to seek out food. He would take off into the Fortress part of the harbor. The grub was excellent food and always different due to the ocean providing 90% of their food. After eating his fill, Vengelixo would walk out front only to see the Kiggy in the distance. A grin would come across his split jaw face and he would make his way to them.When he reached the knights, he would stop beside them and listen to what they were discussing. He wanted to meet these Kiggy since they reminded him of better times in Kirastix.

Somethings never changed; the newer infantry were excited, reminded him of a yearling he had back home that pranced about the corral every morning for breakfast. The veterans and sergeants looked like they were half-heartedly trying to maintain good order and discipline, but most knew there would be another time for that once they were in the field. Blue banners rippled in the sea air nearly every place he could look, mixing with the clouds and the sky. He hate to admit it, but it felt... good.

Mizer's own armor was less flashy then his guards. Like the rest of his status he wore the token white gown, covering his chest and legs but leaving his arms and head fully exposed. It too was covered in runic letters but these where laced in the gown by gold thread instead of the glowing etchings of the guards. The most striking thing about the Lord was his head dress. Metal formed to look like some sort of circlet it wrapped around his undead husked head, a single green jewel planted directly above the forehead. It massive massively ornate, the gold laced delicately around the token black stone material of Belrow. Finally reaching the main gate the group halted as one, without muttering a word, in front of the waiting guards.
