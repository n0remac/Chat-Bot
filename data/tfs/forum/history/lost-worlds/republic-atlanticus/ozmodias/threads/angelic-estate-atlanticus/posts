It's hard to place.The wax seal indicates Gaiaton, and so it can be easily surmised that it is from it's Mayor.\"To the Governor of Atlanticus, Giplor Vauc'Tutt,Gaiaton has come under a looming shadow. Beasts, at least numbering two, have been attacking its citizens nightly and dragging them to their death. Usually this can be well handled, but these beasts seem as intelligent as any man, perhaps even more so since man keeps underestimating their ability.The people of Gaiaton are beginning to subscribe supernatural elements to these attacks. They call the beasts the Demon and the Pitch, since they only seem to attack at night and with ravenous hunger. Curiously, they only seem to be attacking the road to Gaiaton that we are in the effort of widening and making more accessible to the other cities and villages of the Republic of Atlanticus.While I know you must have affairs of your own, your advice and even your help and support of this matter would be greatly appreciated. As the Governor and a mamber of the Brothers of the Sword you must have access to warriors. Any warrior that seem righteous of heart and mind and able of body, please send them to Gaiaton to handle the Demon and the Pitch. They will be richly rewarded.Most sincerely,Neferet Ankh-ShamsutMayor of Gaiaton.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "A letter arrives on Papyrus paper.
