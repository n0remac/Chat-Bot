The place is built with a number of rooms to house the staff that serve the Emperor and his family, and the family as well.

Many times, the Emperor can be found in meditation in the gardens. Inside, the halls are immaculate - decorated in silk tapestries and with many ornaments of delicate vases, sculptures of legendary creatures, presented armors of old warriors on display, and stoic statues of pewter and jade.Most will only see the splendor as far as the throne room of the Emperor - to be found out of place in the palace is a terrible crime, especially if found by the Shogun.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/STUhyAG.jpg", "http://i.imgur.com/CDEizS5.jpg"], "html": "<div align=\"left\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/STUhyAG.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/><br/></div>"}, "post-61957": {"user": null, "user_num": null, "timestamp": "1490311266000", "message": "The majority of the troop would be asked to remain outside the gates of the palace - and not a single wolf would be allowed inside.
