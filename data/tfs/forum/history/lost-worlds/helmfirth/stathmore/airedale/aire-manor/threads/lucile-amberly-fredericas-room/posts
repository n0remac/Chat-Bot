Her body felt heavy and she had a slight limp in her steps as her ankle has started to get swollen from an injury she had gotten earlier that day. It made it hard to keep up with the fast strut of Lucile, but she tried her hardest anyway. While they were traversing the long hall, her mind started to recall the happenings of this day. She had only come to Erstonia a few days before. She had hidden in the load space of one of the ships that were in the docks, never guessing that the ship would take her to a place full of bandits and thiefs. Even those days had been hard, but she had managed to come by. Until Chataya had suddenly appaered in the streets, followed by strong big monsters and mythical beasts that had listened to her very demand. Everyone had started to run, and so had Primrose. But spraining her ankle had resulting in her tripping. She hated herself for her clumsiness. It had not taken long before her hellhound and gotten a hold of her scent and had chased her down. He had dragged her back to his master by her arms. She had fought against it, but all it had gained her was slight burns on her skin and the teeth of the beast sinking deeper into her skin. Even when the hellhound had let her go she had fought her hardest to try and get out of the grip of one of the big men that had been holding her and put a shackle around her wrist. When she didn't listen when they told her to calm down, she had been given some kind of shot and she had found herself losing consiouness. She remembered nothing from getting to her cell. She just knows that when she woke up next she was laying on the cold stone floor, her arms chained to the wall. She had still been very drowsy when the next person came into the cell. Just to strip her of anything she had on her person and leaving her naked on the floor. Her mind still too much in shambles to even consider fighting it. There she had been for what felt like hours, shivering from the cold floor against her naked skin and not being able to stand up as her chains to short. Only when they had taken her out of the cell and paraded her off to the covenent meeting she had been dressed in simple brown cloth. Nobody had said a word to her, just dragged her there. And now she was here. By the time she was done recollecting her thoughts they had entered the room of Lucile, her new owner. She hated that word.. she didn't want to be owned. At least, for now, it seemed that she got the master that would not flay her, or kill her just to bring her back to life. That didn't make her any more happy though. The room was warm and comfortable and she didn't see any places where she could be shackled to the wall. The other two slaves laid themselves down on comfortable pillow and beds, something she would have loved to do but she was still stuck to the chain Lucile held. She wanted to cry, but no crying would come. She was too numb after everything that happened today, too tired. When Lucile asked her a question, she had been too distracted to hear exactly what she had asked her. Only the words 'Good girl' stuck in her mind. She would look up into Lucile's eyes, her own eyes heavy with black rings from her exhaustion and would nod. It was all she could do as her troat felt like it would explode if she tried to say anything, her body too tense for its own good.
