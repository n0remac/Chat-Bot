It was the feeling of the charged air, and having a far too familiar sense of it. Instinctively her foremost legs and hindmost would rise up in a prayer curl while the remaining middle four spread out for support along the ground. The first arcs of power that surged forth would latch to the forelegs like electricity drawn to a lightning rod and dance and light and crack and hum as it was nulled out rather than finding the source that was situated behind the Arachne herself.The sheer power of the magicks was enough to send the two undead spear men flying off the staircase in a number of bony pieces and bits of armor - wondering what in the hell had just happened as their skulls bounced along the pavement in dumbfounded amazement.The display brought around the attention of the Minotaur guards, who stormed through the gates roaring in a fury - what in the world was going on?!High up along the towering structures of the facility there was much movement - like watching the moving walls of a beehive with the entirely colony nested inside. And many - possibly hundreds - took to the air on a mix of wide, batish wings of bone and membrane and feathery wings of dark colors. They were swarming far overhead and all about the area of the prisons and partially about this side of the city.When the light show finally died Nessoria would be standing there, her feminine portion leaned back from her forelegs - revealed by the light that her legs were discreetly plated in steel with an odd sheen - until they eventually settled to the ground again. Her expression had shifted from the smile to a very displeased, almost disappointed, scowl. Her attention went to the mage, and the state her cuffs were now in on the ground.\"... ... those are not very reliable bindings. If that's what they, indeed, are,\" she murmured, her tone still gentle but annoyed and on the verge of suspicion.

In fact her aura took on a violet hue as it rippled up and down her body and the air around her. Her body was tense and ready to react to any move made against her.\"I take full responsibility for that stunt.\" She placed a single foot forward, the shimmering violet crackling as she did so. \"I was hoping to end your reign of terror over the humans painlessly.\" She cracked her neck. \"But I guess a good old fashioned brawl will work too.

But spending time with the reckless dragon Jarkoopi had, for a brief moment, regressed some of the maturity she had acquired under Van'ei's tutelage\u00a0and brought back her youthful ornery self. And for a while it was rather refreshing. It would have been nice fighting an army of supernatural creatures. It might even have been feasible. Still, she decided that the rational thing to do in the end was... blegh... retreat.And so, instead of using the power she had gathered to atomize the approaching minotaur, the lightning would encircle both herself and Jarkoopi and warp them through the ethereal realm and away from this place.
