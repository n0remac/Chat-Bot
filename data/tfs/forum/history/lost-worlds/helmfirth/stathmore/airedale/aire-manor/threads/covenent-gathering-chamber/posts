The skeleton lifted a small silver serving dish from a side table, and removed the lid, then offered to each guest a warm, lemon scented hand towel with a pair of silver tongs, beginning with Lady Lucile, then on to Lady Chataya, who, as it thought may have been the case, had not yet had time to change from her workwear. As it offered her one of the lemony towels, it greeted her by name. \"Ah, Lady Chataya. If you so desire it, there is warm water and a handmaiden in the Crimson Suite, and a ball gown for you, should you wish to change.\" It offered the choice subtly, making no judgement on her choice should she wish not to take advantage of the facilities. \"I see you have brought quite a selection.\" it said approvingly, running its flaming blue eyes over the array of slaves that Chataya had brought, and it's gaze lingered long on the red head. Osseus had not seen one like that before, and as it's eyes roved over it, it thought of her skin stretched over it's bones, and yet, he knew that this one was destined for his mistress, and so disappointedly set aside his fantasy. Onward to Aleister with the silver bowl of towels, and the necromancer was offered one on the silver tongs. \"Lord Aleister, you are looking magnificent as always,\" it opined, sizing Aleister up. \"I do hope you and your dear sister of course will be staying the night.\" It left the comment hanging, feeling that flirting too outrageously with the guests was probably not appropriate. Then Osseus's eyes alighted on the pet that Aleister had brought, the male former-human, whose skin had mainly been removed, and that Osseus itself was now wearing. \"Oh, how amusing, the two parts are back together again,\" said Osseus, as it regarded the pet with the same face that the human had once worn in life. \"What a splendid jest Lord Aleister.\"  Having distributed the towels, Osseus clapped, and a slave retrieved the salver from him, while others brought out more dishes to set before the guests. It then took its place, standing behind and to the right of Lady Lucile as it let the guests get on with whatever they wished to eat before the new slaves were evaluated.

It began to feel a certain dissatisfaction with the skin, it's shoulder's hunched a little and it scratched absently with its ill-clad fingers the flesh of its other arm. No, this one was no good. Not right at all. Osseus looked over with great interest as Lady Chataya brought out her selection of new slaves. It took a quick pass down the line, noting the features of the twelve and mentally sorting them into which would be useful, and for what. The skeleton walked up to the man who Chataya had introduced as a sort of linguist. Useful for entertaining the occasional foreign guest. It took a hold of the man's jaw firmly, forcing him to open his mouth, and looked inside, examining the teeth. It then took a general check of the slave's state of health, as much as was possible by eye. \u201cIf it's healthy, I'll take it. But it needs further examination.\u201d As visibly scared as some of the slaves were of being manhandled by a glowing eyed skeleton, they had little inkling that being chosen by Osseus as a potential slave of the household was one of the least worst things that could happen to them. Osseus did not care for a slave's state of mind one way or another as long as they were able to perform their assigned functions, and while punishments were suitably harsh for those who took their time in learning not to make errors, the slaves generally weren't tortured or had sadistic whims enacted upon them, in order to keep them sufficiently mentally healthy to enact their duties. The only exceptions being those kept for the amusement of the manor's occupants and their guests, who did not all share Osseus' love for efficiency above all things. The skeleton's eyes slid to the pregnant elf. \u201cPerhaps the offsrping will be of use. I would be pleased if you would give me first refusal once you have raised it to a sufficient age,\u201d It said to Chataya. \u201cI fear the female will be of little use as a whore once the young has been whelped. The process mars the body rather, inside and out.\u201d It ran a hand over the skin of its chest, feeling the coils of hair that stood out on it. \u201cThe skin \u2026 is often ruined with unsightly marks. There's a likelihood this female may not survive the birth \u2013 I prefer the slaves I buy for the household to have at least a few years use in them.\u201d There was a tone to its voice that suggested it disapproved of Chataya even bringing a slave with such a short shelf-life to its and Lady Lucile's attention. It stopped also before a dark haired woman, a human. Roughly it's own height, the skeleton judged. The woman's cheekbones were strong, her skin an earthy red-brown and, when the skeleton touched it, velvety soft. It found the way the hip bones jutted to the surface pleasing. Yes, her skin \u2026 was \u2026 quite pleasing, quite \u2026 interesting. It turned her, surveying her front and back, her sides. \u201cThis one I will take for my personal use,\u201d it said to Lady Chataya. Osseus did not talk money at the dinner table. Chataya would bill it for the slaves it chose, and it would pay, all behind the scenes and without quibble. Osseus always found her prices quite reasonable. Once it was through with the woman it chose for itself, Osseus saw Aleister motioning towards it, and stepped back with a small bow to Lucile and Chataya, to see to Lord Aleister's wishes. \u201cMy ladies, I shall return presently,\u201d it said, before letting the two ladies continue their negotiations. It lowered its head to be close to Aleister's, hands clasped behind its back, ready to receive his whims. \u201cThe guest rooms are already prepared, my lord, in case of such an eventuality. Your wish is my very command, while you are under this roof,\u201d Osseus's flaming blue eyes smouldered at Lord Aleister as he commanded it's personal attention. Having Lord Aleister look at it in such a way filled Osseus with a deep pleasure like no other. To be regarded as a desirable being was not something it had experienced before Lord Aleister, and the skins seemed only to heighten Aleister's enjoyment. It was part of what made Osseus feel like a real person, not merely a walking pile of bones. \u201cI'll confess, Lord Aleister, I don't believe this skin is 'the One', however, if it pleases you I shall wear it tonight for you alone.

In truth, nearly all of the aristocracy had their own set personal quirks, just as Aleister and Osseus did.It was only the mention of the human resistance that snapped Aleister out of the lustful fog, centered on Osseus, that had settled on his mind. He turned to address Lucile and answer her question.\"High Lady, one of my seers at the spire managed to give us the location of a pocket of the human resistance in Stathmore. I allowed for a party with a few of my creations to raid the hole the little parasites had dug for themselves. The mage that took control of one of my newest creations overestimated her ability to control the creature, and none of the cattle or the thieves that took them survived. Thirty-eight bodies in total were returned to the spire, some of them human and some not - it is still unclear exactly how much information we will be able to glean from the dead, but I expect we should be able to find at least a few more holes to plug.\"Aleister reported the news of the rebellion to Lucile quickly and concisely. She had asked a direct question and would, of course, receive a direct answer. The necromancer took a moment to sip a bit of the hot gray liquid (his drink of choice) in the tea cup he'd been served.\"It is unfortunate that none of the perpetrators of this little temper tantrum survived, but sadly we are dealing with such frail creatures. As an interesting side note, the mage also died in the attempt to bring my creation under her control again. Poor thing.\"Given that Aleister had provided life to the undoubtedly brutish and grotesque creature responsible for ripping through the pocket of human resistance, in all likelihood he'd allowed the mage to die at the creature's hand. There was a price to be paid for failure, and invariably Aleister levied a horrible tax against the underlings that found themselves unable to raise to the occasion.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"This conversation continuing much further will almost certainly take on the look of impropriety.

Thankfully I have heard nothing of it from any of my underlings,\" Osseus spoke up into the vacuum left by the end of the twins' bickering. \"Should it reach the manor, it truly would be a blight. Until then, perhaps it will contain itself to outlying quarters of the realm.\" The seneschal's remit was the manor itself, but Osseus would have no qualms about stepping forth to crush slave rebellions should it be required to do so.
