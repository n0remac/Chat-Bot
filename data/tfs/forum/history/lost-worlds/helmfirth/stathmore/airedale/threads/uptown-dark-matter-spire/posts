Dark mages have been known to come from\u00a0far and wide\u00a0to the Spire to study and\u00a0ply their\u00a0respective disciplines\u00a0without the prying eyes of a government -\u00a0of course in exchange for helping to\u00a0perpetuate\u00a0the Spire's mysterious work.The top portion of the Dark Matter Spire as well as a sprawling basement\u00a0are the private living quarters and\u00a0study area for Aleister Crowley , an aristocratic\u00a0necromancer appointed by the Helmfirth Aristocracy to oversee the tower's activities.", "link_list": ["/user/2271"], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/RHtsXd6.jpg"], "html": "<p align=\"center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/RHtsXd6.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/></p>"}}
