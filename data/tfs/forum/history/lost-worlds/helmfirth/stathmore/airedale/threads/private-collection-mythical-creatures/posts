There is even a door that connects the buildings\u00a0in between them.\u00a0The building is owned by the Warden herself Chataya Crowley and is used to house her growing collection of Mythical Creatures. Each of the creatures is loyal to her and trained, though it would be ill advised for anyone but her to handle them. \u00a0They are often used to discipline the slaves in the training facility next door and it is not unheard of for prisoners to end in the belly of one of the creatures.\u00a0The creatures found in this collection are, but not limited too:\u00a0Unicorn, Basilisk, Cerberus, Hellhound, Kraken, Dragon, Griffin, Hydra, Phoenix and more.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://img12.deviantart.net/6b79/i/2009/279/8/0/caged_dragon_by_digital_mischief.jpg"], "html": "<img src=\"http://img12.deviantart.net/6b79/i/2009/279/8/0/caged_dragon_by_digital_mischief.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}}
