They shall ride with me in this struggle, and prove their worth.\"\"Welcome, aye, welcome.\"  The Knight-Brothers eagerly greeted the two men, hoping to welcome them into their small fraternity.\"Now,\" Henke began, \"show me to my tent.  Let us discuss tactics.\"A large white tent had been erected in the center of the camp.  Heavily-armored knights were standing guard around it.  Henke, Gareth, and Gerulf would enter and be seated around a large table, along with other senior members of the Erstonian Order.\"My Brothers.  The time has come to take Alnwick.  The pirates, vagabonds, soiled doves thieves, and extortioners there must be brought to the light, or meet a swift end.  The attack will be two-pronged.  A fleet of fire ships will be positioned outside of the harbor, to burn any ship trying to escape.  We will prepare siege engines and bombard Alnwick first; afterwards we will assault the villainous abode with fire and fury, and put those who resist to the death.\"But first.  First... we must offer terms.  Those who wish to leave their lives of ill-repute will be spared and assimilated into the Erstonian Order's sphere.  They will swear obedience to the Most Holy, to the Order, and will pay taxes - and will fight for us when called.  Those who deny will be brutally and swiftly crushed.\"Any questions?\"Gareth Aelfric", "link_list": ["/user/2721"], "image_list": [], "html": "A great host of warriors streamed from Saint Karlsheim on the road to Alnwick; a separate force of fire ships left from Saint Karlsheim's port and was on route to Alnwick now.
