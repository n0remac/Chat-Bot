Of course, there was the occasion wench looking for a date - or someone to rob blind. Ship workers tossing freight and crates and hard at work. The place was lively and loud, occasionally breaking the buzz with the sharp ring of a ship bell.Granted things seemed a touch frantic. There were whispers of some happenings outside the city. Soldiers or 'knights' - this word alone brought doubting chuckles from lips - were posed beyond the walls of the city.
