The ponies they rode were of humble stock, meant only to transport their belongings.  One of the men was dressed in simple, brown robes; judging by his bald head he may have very well been a priest.  the other man wore a light gambeson, carried a sword, a spear, an iron helmet, and a round shield; one might assume he was the priest's bodyguard.As they came forth towards Alnwick the priest would attempt to single a fellow out and inquire \"might I ask the condition of this fine town?
