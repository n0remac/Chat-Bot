When the new set of full tankards was brought in she would give the captain a kiss on the cheek. Throughout her few years of leading the fleet, the kiss had become a symbol of her trust and gratitude. Something only earned by a few captains that had done their share in helping her cause.

They were called sucklings but each pig was enough to feed about 8 mouths. Though for pirates, they might feed a bit less. Soon every man in the facility were shouting and cheering, taking their dirks and daggers from their belts and ripping the meat of the pigs. They were feasting on them until their bellies were round and filled. Abby smiled, she knew a happy crew was always a crew willing to go just that tad further for their captain. And of course for her. She would need to see if she could do something special for the Wenches crew as well. The last pig would be set before Abby and Kelly. It was smothered with honey and butter and the skin was as crisp as it could be and the meat below it very tender. They obviously had saved the best one for the both of them.
