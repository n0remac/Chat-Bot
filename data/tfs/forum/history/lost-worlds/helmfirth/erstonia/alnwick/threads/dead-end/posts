People were constantly in flux going in and out of the drug den, and while the person behind the makeshift bar would know the regulars - not a lot of the patrons stopped and took time to get to know one-another.Shenk, slightly winded and obviously tiring quickly from the journey from the coast walked over to the small bar just inside the door on the right, built in front of the door to the room the proprietors of the Dead End apparently used as a store room. Looking down, anyone would be able to see that Shenk was simply following a trail of blood that led from the front door to the door behind the bar, the bright crimson still apparent as it seemed several people had either been dragged or carried through the door, their wounds spilling blood on to the floor as they went.Shenk coughed as he pulled up on the heavy bit of countertop that was secured to the bar with hinges, moving it out of the way so he could pass, which he would have if the woman behind the bar\u00a0hadn\u2019t immediately and forcefully pushed it back over. The heavy wood countertop slammed down hard with a bang, nearly crushing Shenk\u2019s fingers as it crashed back into place. The woman looked at Shenk expectantly, and almost immediately the shambling disease-ridden man began shouting angrily at her.\u201cWhat the hell do you mean almost crushing my fingers you ignorant wench!? And don\u2019t give me any of your \u2018secret clubhouse password\u2019 bullshit! The devil herself has come to Erstonia and all you lot give a damn about is your stupid little code!\u201dThe woman slammed her hand down on the countertop as Shenk ended his sentence, obviously winding up a fiery retort of her own.\u201cIt\u2019s our \u2018secret clubhouse\u2019 bullshit that keeps the devil away from here, you disgusting bag of pus! And you can\u2019t go in anyway! The people in there have enough problems right now without having to worry about if they\u2019re going to look like you if they make it!\u201d The woman\u2019s tone was firm, and her voice, though loud and angry, stood in sharp contrast to the broken, hoarse, and scratchy monotone that Shenk\u2019s vocal cords produced.Shenk turned to the person that accompanied him.\u201cJust go in there and find Isaac. He\u2019s an elf; an ugly bastard with tattoos on his face, you can\u2019t miss him. Tell him Shenk sent you, or your cat is sick, or whatever the fuck these morons tell you to say to him. I brought you as far as I\u2019m going to.\u201dShenk began to walk back towards the front door of the house, and the woman behind the bar - still obviously riled from Shenk\u2019s outburst - raised the countertop once again to allow the newcomer through.Once through the door, one would find a set of creaky wooden steps, also marked with droplets and drag marks of blood, leading down to a relatively large and open basement teeming with movement and activity. The room, dark and dimly lit by lanterns, immediately would appear to be a makeshift hospital, as the few wounded that got left behind by Chataya\u2019s attack were receiving care from those willing to offer it. There were a few cots strewn around, but most of the patients were either laid out on tables or sitting up in chairs as a handful of people rushed around trying to tend to the most badly wounded first.In the middle of the (only slightly) organized chaos, stood Isaac Aldre , working to stop the bleeding from several gashes in a man\u2019s chest - gashes that could have been made by the claws of a hellhound.", "link_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/OTowux2.jpg", "/user/2463"], "image_list": [], "html": "Shenk walked into the Dead End in the company of a person no one in the establishment would describe as anything but a perfect stranger, but it wouldn\u2019t at all seem out of the ordinary in a place like the Dead End.
