There was game and other predators, normal by some standards, awaiting out in the trees, but upon seeing the sheer number of men marching through the forest they bound away or skulked off somewhere else. There were a number of deer that fled, and the occasional bear or cat that decided against fighting territory against man.Sadly, this far in - there was no man made bridge over the main part of the river. And it was almost clear as day that something changed once one managed to cross the river. The trees, the grass, the brush - even the very earth seemed... darker on the other side. Almost like it was touched by evil, and some could swear they were being watched and that there were eyes in those dark woods.But for the moment?
