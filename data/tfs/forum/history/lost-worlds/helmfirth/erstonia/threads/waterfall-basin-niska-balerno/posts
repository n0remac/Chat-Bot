I\u2019ll be doing most of the talking anyways. If I feel like you\u2019re messing our act up I\u2019ll just squeeze a bit.\u201dJarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui noticed the blue robes that appeared around her with that flash of lightning, those would certainly work. She mentioned how the color may have been related to other members of his race. He doubted the reference was anything polite, likely that the robes were originally crafted from dragon scale, from dead dragons. Instead of telling this, he just nodded.\u201cMhmm. Now uhhh, hop on?\u201d He hovered to reach out towards Jun with one of his claws, careful not to impact or crowd Blackbean as he flew. Once Jun of the Celadine had crossed over, Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui made sure to shift her around in his claws as to comfortable fit her in his clawed hand, but still look as if he\u2019d meanicingly abducted her straight from some sort of meeting or ritual. Then, he began to change as he hummed with magic. The horns upon his head grew thicker, and curled forwards towards his snout, the beautiful color of his shiny blue scales faded into a dull and dreary black, and the membrane that made up his wings became frayed and coarse.I have to fit in with the local dragons native to this area, hmmm?Assuming Jun was prepared and Blackbean was out of sight, he eagerly flew towards the gates of the massive city.
