We believe he's a liar, and we're right, and we, what, kill him?\" Rafael asked, his head tipping a bit with his words. The Rondi were known for becoming a bit... passionate... when they had their tempers riled. Queen Xiomara was a noted difference in that she usually didn't give way to her own temper. \"Or -- we believe him in that he owns this beach, these waters, and these trees we're by and tread with better caution than violent assumptions.\"Juan-Pablo shrugged, but kept a weathered eye on Shenk down the length of the beach. Hector's jaw clenched, and Virgilio smirked, ever so slightly, as Rafael kept his gaze locked on the Captain of the Guard's.\"My job is to keep you safe, Your Highness. It has been since you were a tiny child no higher than my knee. We've come to a lawless place, and that man is covered in plague,\" Hector pointed to the distant Shenk, in case anyone here had a question on who it was that was sickly.The very mention of the word 'plague' made several sailors nearby gesture for protection to the Mother, and one of Rafael's guards did as well. The second scout was still in the wood, unseen, but Hector and Rafael both knew that the second scout was merely waiting for a signal.\"And my job is to spread diplomacy and awareness of the Kingdom of Rondon as the proxy of my mother, Queen Xiomara Vinicio. I will take over from here,\" Rafael said decisively and stepped past Hector in order to take a few steps forward.Behind Rafael's back, Virgilio and Juan Pablo raised their eyebrows and smirked a little. It seemed the Crown Prince was coming into his own, it seemed. Hector was not pleased, but there was a spark in his eye that he was somehow proud of the exchange, if still cautious.Rafael now at the frontline made all of his present bodyguards take new positions among the crowd.\"Our apologies, Shenk!\" Rafael called, his Rondi accent as evident on his words as Hector's was, but his cadence was one of youthful sophistication befitting someone of importance, as was the look of Rafael. \"As you can see, we have been through a tense situation--\" he gestured toward the ship, \"--and emotions are running high. The captain of the ship says that it is likely we have enough lumber of our own to fix the ship, and our navigator already knows the coordinates to the closest city. I beg only then that you allow us the days needed to repair our ship, and then we will be gone.\"There was a lot of bets being made here, of course. The ship had already been well-stocked and supplied with food and drink and shelter to last, and as per usual, ships were usually stocked with lumber for repairs they might need while they were at sea.

Close, I will say. We have close to enough.\"Rafael felt a spear of frustration, but nodded his head stiffly. \"Then get to work. Put in as many hours as you can with as many men as you can spare while the rest make camp and fortify it. They are not to touch a single tree on this island.\"The Sea Captain nodded, then turned to order his sailors, who jumped to the task. Rafael turned to Hector, his voice lower as he walked further up the beach, toward where the 'camp' seemed to be growing and organizing itself. Virgilio and Victor were there, along with the three other guards.\"In the morning, we seek Shenk, and we offer to pay him,\" Rafael said.\"What of the healer he asked for?\" Virgilio asked, not out of concern for the Erstonian native, but out of curiosity.\"No healer. To be that plagued and still able to walk about, shout about, cast threats -- he's possessed or something more,\" Rafael said, making Hector smirk with pride. Rafael wasn't untrained or uneducated -- quite the opposite, Queen Xiomara, the Iron Rose of Rondon, had set the task of grooming him to be her heir almost as soon as he'd been birthed.It was his father's rebellious nature (or so the servants and his mother told him) that had him bucking against the grain. Others, however, felt it was just what a teenage boy was expected to do, to want to fly with his own wings, not those made for him.\"Still, we err on the side of caution,\" Rafael said firmly, looking around at his guards.Then the Bells started to ring.Birds took flight, and even the waves seemed to shake. Their cacophonous sound was discordant, and left a feeling of terror in the pit of Rafael's gut. The sailors and the Captain looked up and over at Hector and the bodyguards. Hector was able to easily signal his men with hand signals only given the bells were too noisy to shout over, but Juan-Pablo had a harder time with his sailors.In the end, however, they managed to move within the camp, where crates and storage and barrels and boxes and things so-far unloaded could provide some sort of cover to what felt like was a hostile attack. Rafael drew his sword and his blue eyes faintly glowed, but Virgilio standing at the 'front' of the beach, made a motion and a small burst of air blew away from him, kicking up sand. Arcane symbols appeared in the air, then glittered over the camp like a dome...... making it invisible to the naked eye. It was like a one-way mirror.

When they were within distance the vessels anchored, and a number of smaller boats were lowered into the water, filled with armed soldiers.Henke, the leader of this expeditionary force, would be on the smaller boats as they came ashore.  Ulrich, an inquisitor, had also been sent on this mission.  Henke and his men were charged with establishing a presence on this island.  The first step was to find a suitable spot for the force to land.  Henke had specifically chosen a spot on the shore where they could observe their surroundings for many miles.Assuming their arrival was not met by any hostile force the Brothers would begin complete disembarkation.  Some soldiers assumed defensive positions, others began hastily constructing palisade fortifications.
