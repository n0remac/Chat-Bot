The beating wings rather flew low, as the dragon dived to try and swoop up any helpless farm animals left in the open, which would presumably send the rest of them scrambling into any shelter they could get into. Just as fast as they rose into the sky, any of the eaten out corpses would plummeted back to the hard ground, leaving the stench of raw meat in the air. After the mighty dragon had consumed his quick meals, dragonfire rained down from the beast\u2019s maw on any crop fields, trying to set any dry fields ablaze, and the green fields with smoldering lines through them. None of building were directly targeted, but the dragon would not care if a building were to be in flames. The flaming breath eventually stopped, as the now raging flames on the landscape either roared on, or began to dwindle down. The presence of the giant creature disappeared back into the horizon, regardless of whether or not he was successful, along with the deep thumping of wings on air.(Edit: <Exit>)", "link_list": ["/post/70369/thread"], "image_list": ["//storage.proboards.com/6046952/images/uCQvKjMwQCSfGa7d4dCT.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@helmfirth\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/70369/thread\" timestamp=\"1499625136\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-0\" title=\"helmfirth\"><img alt=\"helmfirth Avatar\" src=\"//storage.proboards.com/6046952/images/uCQvKjMwQCSfGa7d4dCT.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/70369/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1499625136000\" title=\"Jul 9, 2017 10:32:16 GMT -8\">Jul 9, 2017 10:32:16 GMT -8</abbr></a>  @helmfirth said:</div><div align=\"center\"><i>A large farm town just over the Padstow river, situated in an expanse of rich lands cultivated for crops and feeding livestock.

For the short moment the rift beneath him opened, he gained line of sight of Cheesecake that he needed through the opened portal. The fairy had refused to move this whole time, and had kept playing from afar, but no longer. When Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui arrived over Acrine, he got a good view of all of the surrounding terrain and features when he flew over, and through the multiple rifts that had opened around him, he slowly learned where this fairy was. ((See end of my two posts ago.)) Knowledge was power, and he had kept his cool through his light pain to analyze his situation and react accordingly. The pair of attackers had gotten cocky, blindly trying to destroy the dragon at every turn so badly, they\u2019d dropped their guard.As the rift opened once more beneath him, before Cheesecake could fully finish shrinking her rift to the right size, he used his last reserve of magic he had within him ((See my end of my last post.)) as of now while focusing through a sharp pain in his ribs that was also hurting his concentration. He\u2019d remotely lift up the dirt all around Cheesecake and in one full quick motion, and throw the dirt and rocks onto Cheesecake\u2019s body with full intent to smother the bug into not being able to move or cast under amounts of pressure that a little fairy like her would struggle to escape from. With herself much too busy maintaining with mana and fiddling with her portals, she\u2019d be distracted and even if she noticed and was able to out-maneuver (and leave her portals behind), the earthen chunks would follow her magical presence at rather quick speeds that she'd struggle to outrun (as lifting/moving this tiny amount of earth was such an easy task for a dragon of his size and skill) if she continued to gather or use any magic and if it connected it would stick to her body and joints with forces only capable to be created by magic present to a strong beast such as a dragon. The tiny fae was a fool for thinking she could keep getting away with harming and antagonizing a mighty beast like himself. And now it was time to pay.However, during this, Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui would be of no use to Jun of the Celadine\u2019s struggle with Riley Fletcher and Cheesecake as of now and would also not be bothered by the burning cage around him, as he was deeply focused on ending the fairy\u2019s reign of terror upon him.", "link_list": ["/post/74022/thread", "/user/2505", "/user/2479", "/user/108", "/user/102", "/user/102", "/user/108", "/user/2479"], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/MEBHOUU.png"], "html": "<div author=\"@cheesecake\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/74022/thread\" timestamp=\"1507764757\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-2505\" title=\"Cheesecake The Fairy\"><img alt=\"Cheesecake The Fairy Avatar\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/MEBHOUU.png\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/74022/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1507764757000\" title=\"Oct 11, 2017 15:32:37 GMT -8\">Oct 11, 2017 15:32:37 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-2505 group-0\" href=\"/user/2505\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@cheesecake\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Cheesecake The Fairy</span></a></span> said:</div>In the span of a few seconds, the dragon she was attacking not only encased itself in a cage made of fire and iron but teleported <i>out</i> of it and onto Riley before being covered <i>again</i> by the same cage.

Cheesecake was smart for maneuvering like she did, however, the mere spell was still under the dragon\u2019s control as he focused, and with the rift next to him as his eyes, he could roughly see and figure out what Cheesecake was trying to do. For a brief moment the earth would follow the fairy, at a distance. However it would stop pre-emptively as the fae raised her portal as a shield. The dirt split into two trails, one circling left and right of Cheesecake, fast but not beyond fleeing again or reacting, looking to surround her. Should the portal come close to either piece of earth, it\u2019d back away, seemingly as if the dirt was terrified of the rift. If the fairy let this dirt get behind her, it\u2019d all come flying towards her again, looking to envelope her once again in one giant pile from all but the rift\u2019s direction. Even if this dirt happened to slip by in the portal, Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui was in command of the chunks of earth he was wielding, and would fling any boulders off to the side with it\u2019s added momentum. Should that happen however, it would surely crash through and destroy Jun\u2019s cage of hot beams before flying off into the local forest.The whole scene was quite strange, a fairy wielding a portal as a shield fending off flying chunks of dirt and grass that was being controlled from a dragon in a magical yellow hot cage looking through a portal below him, while on the other side of the cage Riley and Jun seemed to be in a somewhat questionable position with eachother\u2019s bodies against one another and with the male now pinning the female against the ground as she wiggled her body in perhaps a mating motion.
