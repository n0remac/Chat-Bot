Nothing was out to attempt against the newly erect camp by the foreigners. But someone was watching.Needless to say, there were eyes in the forest that reported to the deadly other side of the trees, opposite of these laborers. And word had gotten back to a particular individual, piquing her interest. She hadn't seen something like this in DECADES. The people of the light half of the island had opted to just try to live with the inevitability of the monsters on the other side, but this was something completely different. Were they here to liberate the pitiful humans, or conquer them?Whichever the case, it provided something of change. And that was desperately needed by Airedale's High Lady. 900 years of repeated days with little variety tended to wear on the side of boredom.And so, against advisement of those of the Covenant, Lucile had opted to step into the sunlight to see what all the commotion was. She might be seen by a patrol but not in a normal sense. She opted to take another form rather than the human one, one of a large bat with snowy white fur, staring with blood-red beady eyes from the place she hung - about the size of a large bird of prey with wide wings wrapped comfortably around her body.

The first bolt that came into contact seemed to shatter on impact like fragile glass - and so did the bat. It shattered and broken into hundreds of small pieces that each near instantly took the shape of the same bat in a much smaller form.
