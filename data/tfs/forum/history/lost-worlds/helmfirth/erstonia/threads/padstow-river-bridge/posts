The bridge will be an important strategic location, as well as an economic one.

Any army attempting to cross the Padstow River must first cross this bridge, which will be guarded by the Order's warriors.Henke orders his men, consisting of 100 Sergeants, 100 Crossbowmen, 5 Clerics, 5 Knight Brothers, and 40 Halbruders to establish a camp on their side of the bridge.  They begin to patrol the surrounding area looking for ne'er-do-wells and vagabonds - or any potential enemies.
