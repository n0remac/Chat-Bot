A hall dedicated to drink and, more importantly, lecherous affairs of the flesh. This is a brothel like no other. The women are warriors and you would do well to not forget it. They won't try to seduce you, they won't try to squeeze out that extra bit of coin by showing you a good time. It's all business. If you want them, show the coin and take them. The building is a rather large hall right on the water. There's nothing too special about it's appearance save for the large carved and painted wooden sign of a armored woman's breasts and the words \"Spoils of War\" beneath. Inside was typical too. A large wooden hall with trophies of war decorating its walls and furs adorning the seats of tables with several rooms built of to the sides offered more privacy, though they do much for noise.

This was not a fancy place, nor was it a discreet one. Private rooms were available only by request, and at great expense. This led to a rather raucous building, with much yelling and moaning and chugging of ale. Brawls and fistfights were common, whether over who would get the pretty white-haired girl next or whether or not somebody had gotten elbowed in the face. The fights weren't confined to the patrons, either. The women were generally hardened warriors, raised with swords and axes in hand, and were quite different from the delicate escorts of other institutions. They were no strangers to combat, and were frequently seen bent over the tables with most of their armor still on. After all, removing it cost extra.Amidst the chaos, Alais laid on one of the tables, a bearded and muscular warrior on top of her. Every muscle in the man's body tightened, and he let out a war cry that echoed through the hall. He bent down violently, plunging his face down into her chest. Alais let out a sudden gasp, arching her back in pain. Immediately, she grabbed the man and shoved him away, struggling for a moment against his bulk before finally managing to throw him off. She delivered a ruthless punch to his jaw, producing a sickening crunch. The man fell back, clutching his face, and Alais stood and kicked him. There was another crack as several ribs broke.\"That's what you get for going berserk on me, bastard. I hope that bite tasted good, because you're getting charged triple. Let's see you try biting anyone with a broken jaw.\"She stalked away, grabbing a rag and clutching it to her bleeding breast. The man had sunken his teeth into it pretty hard, and had held on when she'd shoved him away. She'd have to get cleaned up before the next customer.
