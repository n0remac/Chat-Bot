The purpose of this fortification is to offer troop support to the Sentinel Towers, act as an inspection point for suspicious vessels and provide docking for vessels that don't wish to travel all the way to the Ulvjord Docks. A circular wall of earth and stone covered by wood provide the fort's primary defense. Four Gatehouses of stone and steel are they only entrances save for a bridge connecting the northern most wall to the West Sentinel Tower. Within are barracks and warehouses. While there were four entrances only two of the gates were ever used. The east gate, which was closest to the small docks on the bank of the river and the west gate which allows land traffic in and out from the Ostvest Road.

They did not wish to be closer than this walking contradiction of a cursed priest casting blessings of good fortunes than necessary.His pace was an awkward, rolling shuffle. The thunking of his crutch a constant sound as he hopped his way forward with his one good leg. One crewman was kind enough to help him off the boat, to which the priest reached into his longcoat to extract a small bottle of earth. \"Good fortune from ill spirits, should they see to cast ye adrift,\" he told the crewman before hobbling off once more. So. This was the Sentinel's Hold, the first step in the last leg of the journey to his new home. A good thing too; he only had the one last leg to stand on, now.So it was he made his way towards the hold, seeking any caravan's making their way cityward, his light back bouncing on his back, looking more like an old hermit than the young man he really was.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "This was was far as the ship was sailing which served Silas well enough.
