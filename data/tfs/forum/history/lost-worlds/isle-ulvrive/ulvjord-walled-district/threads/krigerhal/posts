Here they rest and live with a decent standard of living. Large amounts of food and drink are served here and always a roaring fire and warm bed. This building has been planned to be the main command center for war time and is the primary nerve center of Ulvjord's and the Volknir's forces. The building is constructed mostly of stone with wooden supports and glass paned windows. The building was made to be sturdy against attackers and functional in every day living.
