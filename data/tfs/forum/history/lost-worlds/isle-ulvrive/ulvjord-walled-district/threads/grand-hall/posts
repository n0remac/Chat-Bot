This grand construct of wood and glass and stone was crafted for the sole purpose of meeting with diplomats and dignitaries. The wood, the primary material, was of the finest walnut and oak, stained and lacquered to create contrast between the two. Pillars and beams were carved and engraved with Nordic knot patterns and animals. The stone floor is engraved with runes and polished, the stones a variety of colors found on the island. Several windows let natural light in from above the walls and decorations. Tapestries and paintings depicting valorous acts of war, the slaying of monsters, images from ancient legends and likenesses of fallen heroes spanned what would have been blank wooden slats. Even Abjorn himself stared out from behind the throne that was set up at the end of the hall, a painting that was gifted to the Volknir in his honor. A single fire\u00a0 warmed the entire building which kept it a tolerable cool and provided just enough light at night to continue any negotiations. This was not a place of comfort, it was a place of business. Its artisanry is meant to impress and even intimidate.
