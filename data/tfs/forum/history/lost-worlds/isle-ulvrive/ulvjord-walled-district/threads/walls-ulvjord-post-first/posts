It's length decorated with many sigils and religious statues from Venland's Midlandic region. The structure stretches in a circular arc from east to west, mountain to mountain. A single massive gate way offers entrance into the heart of Ulvjord, which houses the government, residential and religious centers of the city. This entrance has a massive walnut gate reinforced with heavy bands of black steel that opens and closes sideways. A mechanism of steel gears and counter weights can close the massive barrier in less than 2 minutes. So long as the gate is open, travel between the two distinct districts of the city is unhindered.
