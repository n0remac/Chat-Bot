Unexplored and if asked about by any local villages a good 30 miles away at least, they would tell you to turn back immediately.This canyon was created during what has become known as 'The Cataclysm', a great war spanning many years, ending in an accidental mixture of dark magic spells. The exact details of what caused the war, the nations on either side, or what even caused the spark that started this all has been lost to time. Though what has not been lost, are the aftereffects. This canyon still holds most of the magic that was cast upon the area long ago, causing several mutations in what would otherwise be local fauna and flora. These mutations were larger, more intelligent, and far more vicious than their regular counterparts. Some extreme cases are told of in legends that have spread throughout the lands, of dragons as large as the Capitol City of Isra, or simple dogs having the strength to bust down castle walls.With the depths of this canyon unknown, some have speculated that great treasures await underneath the soils and trees. And some would be correct in their assumptions. Within the canyon, into its labyrinthine caves and tunnels, pockets of concentrated magic can be sensed even outside the Scar. With great promise of riches and knowledge, some groups have already made their journey here, though none hear back from them. For those that have entered before, never return, though that can be said for many areas. Here though, if one is not killed and eaten by what has become known as Scar Beasts, they may become one themselves.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://pre09.deviantart.net/e2a6/th/pre/i/2013/359/4/b/canyons_asurf_pong_353_by_batjorge-d6zblzx.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"World Scar Entrance\" src=\"http://pre09.deviantart.net/e2a6/th/pre/i/2013/359/4/b/canyons_asurf_pong_353_by_batjorge-d6zblzx.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}, "post-54420": {"user": null, "user_num": null, "timestamp": "1477317170000", "message": "The earth itself began to growl.
