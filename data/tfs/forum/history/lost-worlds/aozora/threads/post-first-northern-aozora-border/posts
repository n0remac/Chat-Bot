Harsh braying from her two noble, if troublesome donkeys made her sigh as the mud squished under her sandals as she ran a calming hand down one of beast's flank hoping to quiet it. Rumors were that bandits multiplied like rabbits in these woods and a lone merchant would hardly be a match for armed thugs. A velvety muzzle lipped at the sleeve of her dress searching for a treat as the woman let out a soft laugh before reaching into her pocket producing a small handful of sweet corn. Stroking the lengthy ears of the beast as both creatures munched contently as the smile remained on the woman's face as she imagined the looks of shock that would possibly appear on the bandits faces upon stripping her precious wagon.Glistening webs danced elegantly from the ceiling of the heavy cloth from back to front as spiders of varying size worked dutifully with an almost impeccable flow repairing weaker areas, binding unsuspecting insects and gently rotating eggs with gentle care. The species of spider was native to her homeland able to grow to the size of small dogs preying on  small birds of sparrows and starlings at that size building their trappings under the shifting sands. Their fangs secreted venom able to down such tiny creatures..but the merchant managed to utilize it in healing mixtures as the acidity was remarkable in cleaning out wounds..or worsen them if too much was applied. Softer clicking greeted her as Azir climbed back in the lightly padded seat of the wagon as one of larger eight-legged creatures decided to perch itself on her ebony locks, as an almost purr-like sound squeaked out of it as Azir ran a soft finger along it's abdomen before gently putting back on a nearby web.Lightly flicking her riding crop against one of the donkeys back as the beasts let out another bray, but finally managed to get back on their rumbling slow pace. It was a long way to Itami-cho as Azir mentally reflected on the crude map she was given by the last innkeep she had met..not that the less-traveled man knew each and every landmark. At least her direction was the correct one as the road before her was littered with markings of past travelers. It was eerie to be the only one on the road as her little wagon continued down the road. While a harsh call of 'coin' made her jump slightly as ebony wings fluttered down in front of vision as a crow smugly perched itself on her head before squawking \"Coin\" in a rough imitation of a human voice. That little trick was one Azir taught herself to the tiny flock she tended to as four other crows settled themselves on her person tittering about as birds often do. Only one had managed to a rough replica of the human voice earning the name Mirage as the eldest crow's feather tips were beginning to turn a lighter ash color with each passing season.      Gently offering the few kernels of corn remaining in her pocket as the birds pecked at the offering before the four settled themselves on the top of the wagon with a few scuffles here and there. Only Mirage remained like pampered lapdog in Azir's lap enjoying the gentle grooming of her fingers running over silken feathers. The birds were valuable as alarms as nothing was as suspicious as murder of crows when a stranger entered their territory. While their fiscal valued lay in their occasional shedding and annual molt as their ebony feathers made fine adornments to any item if under the right care. While underneath the wagon hidden from the daylight were small caskets filled with water, aquatic plants and mud as sleeping horned toads slept the days away content, emerging only at night for a feeding occasionally. Such was the life of a traveling merchant..but Azir Mir wouldn't have it any other way..aside from wishing it wasn't so cold.

It was the metallic shine of the hammer that drew their attention..as did much of man's shinier creations in the form of precious metals and coin. A shrill whistle interrupted their soft squawking as the birds took off into the north as Azir ran a single finger down the silken hide of a silent Mirage as the bird dignified in his movement perched itself onto the offered wrist of Azir as his greying head cocked at the apparent peace coming the dwarf before cawing out.Soft giggles escaped the woman as the crow fluffed itself with an air of pride playfully nipping at the woman's fingers from her other hand as she tried to grab the bird's beak. The act similar to a hound wrestling in his master's hand, playful but trusting at the same time.

While the only trouble a merchant like myself can cause is a few unneeded purchases..although I cannot say the thoughts of my feathered companions..\". Mirage twisted his head back up at his mistress with a look akin to an insulted dog before sulkily flapping up to the woman's bared shoulder as the woman apologetically stated \"Oh do not look so hurt Mirage, that man's hammer is much to heavy for your flock to carry anyway...Not that weight has ever stopped you before.\".

Upon walking back over to retrieve his other sword from the bloodied and mutilated thigh of the monster, he paused to take in the view. The previously intimidating and violent beast now lay on the floor like a deflated balloon, the life having left her body and taking with it any reason to fear the beast. He walked through the pool of blood and placed a foot on the thigh containing the sword, and with a single hand pulled the sword free, swinging it to throw the majority of the blood and gore off.He turned to greet his impromptu allies in combat, walking over while hooking the sword on his back. \"Greetings.\" He says to them, taking off his helmet to reveal a rather ordinary face, with brown hair and similarly brown eyes, along fair skin. \"I'm Isembard.\" He offers an armored hand to shake, holding his helmet in the other.", "link_list": ["/user/451", "/user/1265"], "image_list": [], "html": "<div><span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-451 group-0\" href=\"/user/451\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@tjbyrum\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Ralf Valgard, the White Wolf</span></a></span> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-1265 group-0\" href=\"/user/1265\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@ramjam\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Ram Jam</span></a></span> <br/></div>"}, "post-83244": {"user": "Ram Jam", "user_num": 1265, "timestamp": "1528350650000", "message": "\"Thank you for helping us finally kill this thing.
