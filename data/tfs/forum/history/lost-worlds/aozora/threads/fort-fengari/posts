Buffeted by long ages of ocean storms and heavy with the scent of sea salt, its once sturdy walls have started to crumble. Although these breaches in the stone have been boarded up with scaffolds of wood and piles of new stone.Those that reside in Fort Fengari now, are much more noble than the previous inhabitants. The garrison of Aozora soldiers protect this pit stop for those traveling along the Iveran Peninsula, and have had their fair share of dealing with pirates and bandits. These are hardened people, but ordinary people all the same, at least. Most of them are. The resident wizard, a veteran of this land's harsh lessons and the captain of this garrison, feels a dark premonition as a bird's shadow is cast across the sun.He watches the bird fly off, not back out to sea, but towards the forest. Strange, for he did not often see seagulls venture that far inland.In the cool shade of the trees, a lapine woman extends her arm, the bird landing on her forearm and squarking its report to her. She smiles, and with this new information, starts to prepare her assault.Her first move is to wait until cover of darkness, before approaching the walls, body flat against the ground, hidden by the grass and shrubs that surround the fort. She then starts to dig, using her newfound powers to control the roots of the surrounding plants, tearing apart the soil so that she can easily dig with her hands, burrowing underneath the walls like a rabbit. She then pops up on the other side, and shakes off the dirt. She starts to walk towards the storehouse, acting as best she can as if she belonged here.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Along the West Coast of Aozora, nestled in the Iveran Peninsula between the forest and the more mountainous region, lies an ancient castle of stone.

It's been a particularly slow day at the fortress. Not many travelers have passed through the road that the towering fortress watches over, and no orders have come down from Itami-cho for redeployments or new recruits. She decides to take a walk on the parapets, to stretch her legs and catch some fresh air, dropping the papers unceremoniously onto the table and standing up, the plates of her armour clinking together with every movement. She picks up her focusing staff, a long, twisted piece of oak wood capped with a gleaming white star sapphire, and straps her long steel sword to her hip, stepping out of the room.Her staff clicks upon the flagstone of the battlements as she walks the walls, paying less attention to what's within the fort than what's without, enjoying the glorious view. She comes up on the guardsman of the north gate, a strong, burly man from the frozen north, face covered by a huge braided grey beard that stretches down to the centre of his chest. His hair is long and well-kept, tied into a single braid in the back to keep errant strands from flying into his face in the event of a battle. His visage is dotted with scars and scratches from battles large and small, and his eyes are a deep hazel. He's an older man, his countenance somewhat wrinkled and wizened by time, but still clearly alert and spry, back held straight and eyes forward. He sticks out somewhat among the rest of the garrison; the only thing even remotely Aozoran about him is the heraldry draped over his chain maille tunic, his voice and his features strongly reminiscent of the barbaric but powerful Northern tribes.\"Afternoon, Magni,\" she greets, her voice feminine but strong, as she sidles up beside him.\"Slow day, isn't it?\"Marcus meets the captain's eyes and bows his head respectfully. The captain is well respected by her men, strict in discipline yet caring in her ministrations.\"Aye, captain. Not many travelers come this way,\" he replies, in his deep rolling tone. He hesitates for a moment before continuing.\"Er...this is gonna seem a mite odd, but...there's this seagull been watchin' me--\"Sarra breaks into a surprised laugh, but it's calmed by an annoyed glance from Magni.\"Serious. It's been circlin' the fort for hours. What's a seagull doing this far inland? Where I come from we'd call that an omen, we would.\" Magni points to the gull, now perched not far off, studying the pair with beady black eyes. Sarra peers at it for a moment. Something about it does seem...off. She discards this thought nearly as quickly as it arrives, however, patting Magni on the shoulder reassuringly.\"It's probably just looking out for someone to drop a crumb or two. It's just a bird, old friend, don't worry yourself too much about it.\"Magni nods and his eyes snap forward again, though he's clearly still uncomfortable. The captain pulls up a chair and sits at the table beside him in the guardhouse, enjoying his company and chatting into the night.When night arrives, the torches along the walls are lit by the patrols, illuminating the ground below. The trees are cut for several hundred yards around the fortress so as to disallow any from sneaking up in cover of forest. They did not, however, plan for the burrowing bunny. The rabbit is in luck, it seems, as she's chosen the perfect time to infiltrate: during a shift change. As such, the storehouse remains unguarded, though it is locked, the heavy wooden door blocking her from simply waltzing right in.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.pinimg.com/736x/93/56/e3/9356e3ac6e408f38156763988d67b786.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.pinimg.com/736x/93/56/e3/9356e3ac6e408f38156763988d67b786.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/>"}, "post-81779": {"user": "Maru Smith", "user_num": 2886, "timestamp": "1524027409000", "message": "Coming upon the locked door, she presses up against it, coaxing life into the wood of the door with a cooing sound and a gentle rubbing, her purple eyes glowing bright in the night.

The heavy locking mechanism straining under the force. She then steps back, and pulls back her bow. With a single shot, she breaks the weakened lock, causing the door to fly open with a crash.She strolls inside, reaching into a pouch to pull out a handful of seeds. Quickly, she scatters the seeds among the food, before taking an armful of food. She hurries back off the way she came, dodging past the routines of the guards that she had observed from afar.She burrows back down through the hole she had made, and scatters the food near the wall, along with more of the seeds.She then runs as fast as she can, knowing that she will be seen, in fact, wanting to be seen escaping.The seeds would quickly disappear after she had scattered them, embedding themselves in the food, waiting to be eaten.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Coming upon the locked door, she presses up against it, coaxing life into the wood of the door with a cooing sound and a gentle rubbing, her purple eyes glowing bright in the night.

They shout at Maru's intrusion, rushing over to the storehouse, although luckily for her they do not see her scatter her seeds. They still attempt to dash out after her, though their considerably heavier armour prevents them from following her effectively, much less dig through the ground as she does. They pant lightly as they come upon her burrow, peering down into it.\"Was that a bleedin' rabbit woman?\" asks one of the guards, to the shrug of the other. \"I fink it was! What's next, mate? A feckin' blue catgirl that shoots fire out've 'er paws?\"The two guards are not the most perceptive lot, and so they simply take the dropped food back to the storehouse. They do, however, know to follow protocol, and so they report their findings to the commander, who appears several minutes later, having been disturbed in her sleep.Clad in naught but a flowing night dress, she steps out into the courtyard, curling her toes at the cold dusty ground and crossing her arms over her chest as she shivers in the chilly night air. She follows the guards to the storehouse and peers inside, casting a simple ball of magical light to illuminate the interior. She, however, is much more perceptive than the guards, and notices the slight discrepancy of the scattered seeds. They could easily simply be grains of wheat scattered by the rabbit's raid, but something about them seems...odd, to her. She musters the men in the courtyard, standing before them with all the authority of a powerful knight, despite her considerably skimpier dress and her lack of weaponry.\"Men, I cannot tell you not to eat this night, but...I feel that there is something dire afoot. I will not say one way or the other yet, for I have no proof, but I would recommend skipping your nightly meal and resisting the urge to break your fast come morn,\" she calls out, before dismissing the men with a clasped fist to her heart in salute. She returns to her bed, then, though she can't seem to get a wink of sleep that night.Her words have had a noticeable effect upon the men. While many wake up hungry, they refuse their morning rations, instead devoting themselves immediately to their duties. Some still do eat, of course, for most in the garrison are not superstitious, despite their respect toward the commander. Thus, whatever the damage those seeds may cause is dampened somewhat by Sarra's perceptiveness, although not negated entirely.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The shattering of the lock attracts the attention of two nearby guards, clad in chainmaille and wielding heavy halberds.
