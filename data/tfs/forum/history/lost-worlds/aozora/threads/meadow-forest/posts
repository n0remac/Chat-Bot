The hand shovel slapped against branches that had the audacity not to sprout muscles and move out of her way.Osma Gaiman was awfully close to the Legion's camp, which that forest split between the walls and the Hunting Legion's refuge. Of course she would noticed by some sort of nearby scout or party, and soon a slightly larger group merged with that scout about 10 kiggies, not including Nat'ia who was among them.They were nasty, putrid creatures, akin to goblin, kobolds, gnolls, orcs and the like, quite the opposite of Osma Gaiman, of course. Generally armed with lighter armors, javelins, spears, small shields, and hacking weapons, relying on mobility to survive. That mobility would quickly be demonstrated momentarily.The squad of eleven could rapidly surround Osma Gaiman while she was much too distracted gather herbs and the like.Suddenly with jeering and screeching, the Kiggies came from all sides, bearing spears at a charge through the forest. But, luckily they stopped before she would be impaled, by the pointed sticks directed towards her figure. A bit of illiterate banter would be overheard.\"Les kill 'er.\"\"Or eat em!\"\"Naw, dats gud money rite ther.\"Finally, Nat'ia (who appeared to be better armored and decorated than the rest) would break the chatter.\"Quiet you!\"Then towards Osma Gaiman,\"Wat you pretty lady doin out 'ere?

Jewelry, trinkets, loose coins, and any rings (even the trowel) fell victim to their small thieving rough hand. She was rolled multiple times through the dirt with little caution for her physical appearance as the pack searched all pockets and sides of her looking for their payday. Eventually even her finer linens and silks were stolen, recklessly cut apart and removed with a dull knife. The flower apron would likely become someone's new blanket.Soon enough, they decided there wasn't much stuff left of value, and they began to question what to do now.\"Ay, wat now? We gunna eat 'er? I'm pretty hungry.\"\"We should, I like mah meat rich.\"They both received a slap to the back of their necks from their current superior, Nat'ia      .\"You dumb, don't you see dat she's probably worth some gud money to whomever cares enough about her?

Disco trotted through the forest on a path he was familiar with. Shintaro wore his fine robes that he'd brought over from his homeland Katashima, His hair was tied back in a ponytail. By his hip rested Shintaro's sheathed Katana. It had been a relaxing day so far, trips out here helped relieve the stress of running a nation. It had been many years since he last felt such peace, back when he was a boy, before the civil war that would eventually rip the island nation of Katashima apart.
