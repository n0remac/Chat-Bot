Once a long path had been smoothed out leading from the valley towards the mountain, she rolled off and dug into the mountain side, her long worm body taking literal minutes to vanish into the rock.  The rumbling approached Aesath's location as she exploded upwards from the ground next to him, sending thousands of tons of soil flying as she looked down to him happily.\"I finish!  Come see!\"  She said with glee.\"Yes, very good! Commence immediately!\"Aesath was sure to stay out of @shaitana's way, not wanting to be smashed into liquid pulp. He found a nice patch of green trees far from the construction/digging zone that he could rest and observe the earth shapeshifting professional work. Despite the tremendously loud and violent shaking, he was able to grab some quick shut-eye before going to explore his new lair.When she had finished, the growing intensity of the vibrations alerted Aesath as he opened one eye to see @shaitana in front of him. He scrambled to his feet and took flight to get a better view of the new \"carvings.\"\"Excellent! I expect 'peak' quality!\" He said as he began to flap his wings over to what looked like an entrance.((You wanna send me a PM describing it? I am going to create another thread to represent the lair, just so I technically own it and can edit it. After I make the thread I'll post as Aesath as a continuation of this post sorta.))", "link_list": ["/post/59390/thread", "/user/254", "/user/254"], "image_list": ["//storage.proboards.com/6046952/images/uCQvKjMwQCSfGa7d4dCT.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@shaitana\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/59390/thread\" timestamp=\"1484771457\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-0\" title=\"shaitana\"><img alt=\"shaitana Avatar\" src=\"//storage.proboards.com/6046952/images/uCQvKjMwQCSfGa7d4dCT.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/59390/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1484771457000\" title=\"Jan 18, 2017 12:30:57 GMT -8\">Jan 18, 2017 12:30:57 GMT -8</abbr></a>  @shaitana said:</div>Shaitana grinned.<br><br/>\"I make!  Give me day.\"  She said, slinking back into her hole.  Suddenly she leaped forward, blotting out the sky with her massive body, and dove into the ground on the opposite side of the river.  For three solid minutes her worm body followed as she rapidly burrowed through the rock and stone.  The rumblings of her movement quieted down as she moved into the distance towards the massive mountain, but Aesath could easily see her movement as the ground above her vibrated violently as she tore away its foundation.  When she reached the mountain itself, thousands of tons of snow slowly fell from the peak from the shaking.  Hours of this passed as the sun worked its way across the sky.  Should Aesath continue to watch, a massive dust cloud exploded from the side of the hill facing the river, a slanted hill climbing upwards to it.  The hole left by Shaitana's fist bursting through the wall was tall enough to fit a creature one hundred times Aesath's size.  Shaitana's head poked out, cheeks filled with food.  In her hand was a boulder as large as a skyscraper.  She chewed what was in her mouth, staring off into the distance contently, before taking a bite out of the boulder as though it was an apple.  Chewing for a bit she looked over to Aesath and froze, suddenly remembering what she was supposed to be doing.<br/><br/>\"Oh, right...\"  She muttered sheepishly.  Quickly gobbling the boulder down she shrank back into the hole and the rumbling continued. And it would remain until the sun had long ago set.  Even as the night went on, the sounds of scraping could be heard inside.  At dawn the snow from the peak had fallen and left the mountain bare.  Shaitana once more appeared from the hole she built and began to punch the ground in front, as if attempting to smooth a path.  She pulled her body along it, punching the ground every few hundred feet before shifting forward once more.  Once a long path had been smoothed out leading from the valley towards the mountain, she rolled off and dug into the mountain side, her long worm body taking literal minutes to vanish into the rock.
