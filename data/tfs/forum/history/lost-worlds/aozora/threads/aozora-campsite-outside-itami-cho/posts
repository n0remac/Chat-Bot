She raised her hand with a little \"Mmm\" indicating that she was both a healer and a mage.She swallowed. \"I can heal and deliver powerful magical strikes, though not at the same time. I've got about a dozen mounted archers helping me from the Acacia Clan.\"Nearby, several leather armored men and women made their own \"Mmm\" sounds. They too were eating sandwiches.\"They can snipe and skirmish with the best of them, but it'd be nice if we could utilize their riding abilities too. Maybe they could simultaneously strike the archers in the towers and then circumnavigate back to the entrance of the camp to help with the main assault, using their superior mobility? I can handle myself in the front lines too if that's where I'm needed.\"Jun took another bite of her sandwich.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Jun was eating a sandwich while listening to the battle plan.

I feel like we should attempt a frontal assault.  This is what I have so far.\"Riley separated four units, assassins, and placed them at the corners of the walls.\"We need a small squad to silently scale up the walls to take out the archer guards.\"He poked Cheesecake gently, who nodded and stood up.  She jumped down to the table and walked to the center of the camp.  She was barely taller than the miniatures themselves.\"Cheesecake will sneak in and scout for summoners.  She will mark them with what's called Faerie's Fire.  It will give them a warm glow that'll make them easier to spot but will give away our ambush.\"As he spoke, Riley separated a small group of soldiers and a a couple clerics, pushing the miniatures towards the front of the camp.\"However, at the same time a second team will attack.  After Mr. Jam opens the gates, the second squad will charge in and take anyone they can out.  This will scatter the bandits.\"Cheesecake started poking the miniatures curiously.  Riley took some animal miniatures and placed them around the front of the gates.\"At this point the bandits will be starting to organize.  The first squad, the ones that took out the archers, will snipe any and all enemies tagged by Cheesecake's fire.  After they are neutralized, they are to focus on any and all ranged enemies.  From behind, we will have the attack dogs run in and attack enemies that try to escape or flank.\"He moved the last of the miniatures, archers and mages, closer.\"At this time we will have the mounted archers and mages advance.
