These farms are small, but take advantage of the natural ecology to produce maximum results on minimum land.These farms contain large rows of cassava plants mixed in with rows of mung beans. These plants work well together. The mung beans helps replenish the soil, allowing the cassava to flourish and help aerate the land. Other similar farms use peanuts and cow peas. The Land-Tillers have combined their wisdom with that of the Aozorans to develop proper farming methods based on the seasons. If maintained properly, these farms use land 50-100% more efficiently than normal farms.Magic runes can be found interspersed among the plants, helping to assess the health of the soil. Blue runes mean the soil is healthy. Red runes mean these is a problem. For the moment, all the runes are blue.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i114.photobucket.com/albums/n257/OrangeClouds_115/Kenya/IMG_3751.jpg"], "html": "A joint project between the Land-Tillers' Guardians of Gaia and the Aozoran people, the Itami-cho farmlands were originally created to help stave off starvation until the bandits could be cleared from the forests.
