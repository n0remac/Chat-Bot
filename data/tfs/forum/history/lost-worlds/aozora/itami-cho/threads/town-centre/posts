He had a thick black traveling cloak hung over his person, with a sort of black chain hanging loosely around his neck.During the Eastern Crusades, Wolfgang was an infamous Knight-Brother, who earned the nickname 'the Mace' by savagely executing his prisoners of war with his signature mace.

The Knights had retained the heavy mail and plate armor from their years in the Brotherhood, and was armed with swords, heater shields, and crossbows; they could be an intimidating sight. The mercenaries were armed with almond-shape shields, spears, swords, and padded armor; a few carried crossbows instead of spears and shields.The artisans brought along supplies for tents, and the tools of their trade: hammers, saws, nails, ploughs, and much more.
