Osma lurked, waiting for a sign of @asthor The Renaissance Man to show himself so that he could get another tongue lashing from her. How many complaints had she filed already about his noise or how his building blocked at the sun from her building's face and kept her from growing herbs, life saving herbs, in her front windows?Over thirty, for sure. If Geeeeeeoooorrrrrgeeeeeeeee!!!!  was delivering them all, she wasn't sure. Warlord Shintaro Nishida  must be highly annoyed with her by now. She bitched about it every time she went to check on his eye socket. \u00a0\u00a0So Asthor had built her a ton of side windows and threw in some flower boxes on the outside and in the tiny courtyard in her store's rear.
