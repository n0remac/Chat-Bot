The gnoll side stepped, the goblin had actually tripped backwards and stumbled away, while the shielded kobold used her offhand to take the heavy impact of the axe, staggering a bit backwards. However, as the orc finished his burst of wild swinging, the female gnoll in the tree already had an arrow trained on his back.She let the arrow loose towards Durgash\u2019s back. Since Durgash was distracted and un-shielded, the arrow would easily strike him in the shoulder from the back. However, the bow and arrow she was packing was not a very impressive weapon, but it would be plenty to pierce his armor and skin. Whether this would hinder the orc or just enrage him, was yet to be seen.The male kobold that was behind Durgash took a step towards the massive figure of Medus and raised his spear to him.

The female kobold gasped then fell forward and dropped her shield and spear as a much heavier branch fell across the back of her legs and pinned her in place against the ground, unable to stand up, trapped.Eventually the sound of cracking wood and rustling leaves would end. The three underneath were trapped, with two of them napping, the tree jumper was sitting near the original trunk left in the ground, clutching at her leg, and the lone male kobold decided to try and run into the high grass to escape the two monsters.

The orc was glad at first that his ally finally came to his aid; but instead of crushing the kobold behind him, Medus attempted to shield the hulking body of Durgash with his own, enormous armored figure. Durgash wasn't delighted by this at all. \"Stop this. Pointless.\" Medus' quiet words sounded in the orc's ear. That only made Durgash even more infuriated. \"What human doing?! Kill them!\" He shouted in response. Now, Medus attempted to restrain the orc, trying to prevent him from killing his aggressors.First Medus was Durgash's companion, now this? What is this treachery?! Whose side was Medus truly on? Maybe he was but a bandit in disguise! The idea flared up in his mind, and the remnants of Durgash's rage awakened once again to turn the blood in his veins into fire that blinded the thought and sharpened the strength. Durgash concentrated his brawn on an elbow strike to stagger Medus and stop his attempt at curbing his wrath. Dazed by his anger, he quickly brought forth his axe again and launched it directly at Medus' face, which subsided his hatred somewhat after he did. As the axe was about to hit his false ally, Durgash wondered if he was right to react so violently. He was worried that the strike may kill the human, however, he quickly remembered all he heard about the quality of human armors. In the worst case, his blow would knock Medus unconscious, or so he hoped.
