As soon as he arrived he could feel him, his presence always lingering in the air. A chill ran down the elf's spine as he navigated his way through the ruins with his staff. It was odd to walk the very same streets, gaze upon the same hills and mountains, and yet have them be so different. He could not linger, it was just a swift check and then he had to be gone. He made his way up the steps towards the door, panting slightly from power walking through the vast ruins. His palm met with the door. It was still sealed, just as he had left it. He wiped away whatever filth nature had covered it in, revealing the inscription. He mumbled to himself, haunting memories washing over him as he reminisced. The strangest feeling washed over Elividorh, and quite suddenly.\"It can't be...\" he thought to himself, turning slowly to face the staircase leading down to the ruins.

The light at the tip of his staff was wavering, growing ever weaker as the wraith pressed on. Finally Elividorh connected, forcing his sword to pierce the torso of the wraith. There was no screech, only silence. The wraith fell onto its back, its fingers scratching gently at the surface of the stone. Elividorh pointed the tip of his staff at the head of the wraith, muttering two words. A light emitted from staff, consuming the wraith, banishing it. Silence fell over the valley, and Elividorh felt relief wash over him, but something else as well. He furrowed his eyebrows, letting his fingertips slide gently down his side. It was warm, wet and just then, the pain hit him. He fell to his knees, struggling to get a good look at the wound. The wraith's blade had buried itself deep in his side, and he had not felt a thing. In his desperation, Elividorh tore at the robe, revealing a cut just below his ribs. Blood was oozing, his veins were tight against his skin, and it suddenly hit him. The poison traveled within him, and fast. He felt his heart pound in his chest, his sight worsening by the second. His palms were against the stone, and he didn't even feel the mixture of saliva and blood drip from his mouth, he was numb. He struggled to draw breath, the agony taking over as his senses abandoned him entirely. He had expected to hear the voice mock or laugh, but it did neither. There was silence, not even the wind dared speak up. This had been the intent, not to kill him, this was his fate. Elividorh drifted, walking the line between life and death as clouds pass in the night sky above him.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Elividorh struck with precision, bringing his blade to the wraith with not a shred of mercy.
