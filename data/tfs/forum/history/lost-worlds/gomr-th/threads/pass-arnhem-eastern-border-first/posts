One would be aimed at the side of the path where he was standing, and the other would come flying from above. Her plan was simple. Destroy the pass underneath Darothil's feet. Utterly obliterate the rock itself. The explosion would consist of pure terror and concussive force, enough to shatter a dragon's bones and melt its scales. The pass underneath Darothil would be nothing but a crater.

D\u00e2rothil peered directly into the eye of the bird, its presence disturbing the evil forces that rested in the mountain ranges for miles in every direction. Light shone upon the pass, illuminating the orcs and D\u00e2rothil. Most of the orcs were dying merely from stress and heat, the phoenix' presence was negating their life force, it was prohibiting their existence. D\u00e2rothil had faced greater warriors, greater wizards and greater foes, but this spell was remarkable indeed. His casting was ended, and the skies cleared up slightly.Rocks and great amounts of earth rushed down the mountain side, sweeping orcs and everything alike with it into the deep. Soon fragments the size of horses would rain down over the path, and waves of dust and mud swept across the lower pass. This would easily knock the intruders off the path unless they had someway of staying in place. As the mountains crumbled around them, Jun's spheres raced towards their target with intensity. D\u00e2rothil raised his staff high, and the two spheres impacted. The path through was obliterated, blowing rock and stone apart as if nothing, pulverizing the already frail trail. The dust from the explosion and the landslides were filling the pass, the only area somewhat well lit was directly below the phoenix, where the adventurers were standing. Now there was only the sound of dirt seeping into the black abyss beneath the group, they could consider themselves lucky that the entire thing didn't collapse under them. As the smoke cleared, they'd find their surroundings looking slightly different, the cliffs had taken different shapes, and there was no path for them to thread. For but a moment the area seemed tranquil, and at peace. The silence was interrupted by a faint whisper, a weak call from beyond the settling dust. From beyond the smoke was a figure, it was quite faint. As smoke cleared the group would to their horror be met with the sight of D\u00e2rothil resting mid air above what had once been the trail through the pass. He was unharmed, the dark from behind his helmet focused on the group. \"How does it feel\" the voice whispered, the raspy voice was physically painful to listen to for most people, it was comparable to being pricked in the inner ear with a very long and sharp needle. \"How does it feel to devote oneself to... A weak and insignificant god?\" the voice spoke, ending the sentence with a mocking chuckle. His gaze was locked on Zaltos now, for he was the new person of interest.\u00a0\"You have fought gallantly\"\u00a0D\u00e2rothil muttered, a deep hatred underlining his voice.\u00a0D\u00e2rothil looked upwards towards the stationary phoenix, he didn't seem intimidated or worried about its presence. \"Now our conversation comes to an end, and I suspect so will your lives\".\u00a0D\u00e2rothil closed his palm quite calmly around the crystal mounted at the tip of his staff, and with a soft whisper his body and belongings would evaporate into nothingness, much like a breath of fresh air on a cold winter morning.\u00a0There was silence, and then more silence.\u00a0The ground started shaking very lightly, then a little more. Small rocks were dancing on the dirt path, the sand shuffling violently as the shaking got even more violent. The clouds above had disappeared with\u00a0D\u00e2rothil, and everything had gone back to normal, but then.\u00a0A light from the dark below, a soft shimmer from the abyss. It was so deep down, what was it? It was getting bigger. Then a faint guttural ground sounded out in the pass, almost as if the very heart of the mountain attempted to communicate with them. Then another louder growl, from directly beneath them.\u00a0Something was making noises and approaching from the abyss, something that had not seen the light of day since the elder days.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "D\u00e2rothil hissed at the phoenix' arrival, the clouds directly over the group clearing up as the bird remained stationary, flapping its wings above them.

While technically demonic in origin, they weren't evil and took no issue with goodness and light.

Cinnamon ruffled and pecked at her feathers, allowing some demonic parasites to detach from her body. These creatures were more of an evil alignment than the crow, so they immediately started smoking and smouldering until they were reduced to ash.

If there was just a way to signal to him that she was in danger, maybe he could use the scroll she gave him to reverse summon himself here.One of the components of that scroll was her own blood...Ugh... goddammit.Jun once again pulled out her macuahuitl and drew, this time, a very tiny sliver of blood. Now that her body was saturated with light magic, she could easily heal her own injury. Maybe there was a way to signal Jarkoopi that way.She sent a pulse of light and psionic energy into her own blood, healing the injury, while also focusing on teleporting to Jarkoopi's scroll. It would be totally impossible at this distance, but maybe he'd get the signal...It was a long shot. Would Jarkoopi get the signal? And would his mastery of magic allow him to use the scroll to reach her?", "link_list": ["/user/102"], "image_list": [], "html": "<i>This is so cool!</i>"}, "post-17292": {"user": "[Phoenix] Zaltos Kiraxo", "user_num": 29, "timestamp": "1448764342000", "message": "\"Trogdor, I don't think there's much we can do to hurt this volcanic titan by ourselves.
