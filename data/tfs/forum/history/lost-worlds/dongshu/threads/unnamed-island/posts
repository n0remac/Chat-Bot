The jutted structure was a far cry from a docking pier it had once been. The being looked something... normal, perhaps, in Nathan's drunken state. It would turn and it would become a little clearer as it approached - a figure hunched over slightly and taking wide, precises steps forwards with each making a slightly wet slapping sound on the unforgiving terrain. The eyes were thin and sharp, and the pointed face was coming into a better focus to show it was not human... the beak of the creature was pointed at him as it approached, each sway allowing the water upon it's head to slosh gently in the indention upon the crown of its skull.Quietly, carefully, hidden partially by the sound of the waters constantly running into land and recending, was a second creature that was crawling from the waves on the other side of the boat.ChanceThe forest was thin, and most of the trees were stiff and dull in color. The place was not vibrant. The gnarled trees would give away to an immediate expanse of hills just as dull and a quiet beach kissed occasionally by sea waves. Odd sounds, inhuman and foreign, screeched out briefly from the forest behind the man. Much further along the coast, almost dots on the horizon, was a canoe and two individuals at the water.", "link_list": ["/user/3038", "/user/149"], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/3RarwfI.jpg"], "html": "<span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-3038 group-0\" href=\"/user/3038\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@datboi\"><span itemprop=\"name\">datboi</span></a></span>"}}
