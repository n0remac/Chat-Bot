The road leads up to the comfortable house that is the home of Yumiko, the owner - a young woman that keeps to herself and her stock and is seldom seen out in public. The house has a small kitchen, bath, bedroom but a comfortable living area to entertain the odd guest she receives - usually in business of her horses. Just outside her door and off the little porch is a cellar with the double wood doors lashed shut. A little orange tabby cat is seen lazing about the land, if it's not chasing mice or birds.Beside the little house is a dense garden with a few vegetables that feeds her home rather than goes to market - usually turnips, cabbages and radishes and a few sweet onions. It is fenced in with a cute waist-high wooden enclosure to help deter livestock or the occasional wild animal from partaking in her food.The rest of her property is enclosed with a much higher and stronger fence of small tree logs around a mostly flat field of wild grass with the exception of a large stable - furnished and built with a number of stalls to hold a dozen or so horses. The barn that houses the animals is relatively close to the house inside the fence.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<div>A sprawling farm that covers several acres of land on the outskirts of Napo.
