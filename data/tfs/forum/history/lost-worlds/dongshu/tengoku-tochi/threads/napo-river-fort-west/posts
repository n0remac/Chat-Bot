Not to mention bent saplings ready to snap from their ropes binding them over and have them flail about with small spines tainted in poison to strike at whatever loosed it.Being a shinobi left him with all sorts of small tools at his disposal. And he employed any he could come up with upon request to ensure that they were protected from ambush.Later into the evening, when the fires finally died to something that could be worked around, troops wandered into the charred remains of the western fort. It was a terrible sight. Bodies were warped and twisted in their last poses before death consumed them, most of them bandits. A pit dug beneath a platform, now collapsed, revealed more burned bodies - and these were in chains. Prisoners, more than likely. It was a grim thing to witness, and two men would return to camp to report the finding - having not been able to stomach being there any longer upon the discovery.But in some means of uplifting news, there were intact remains. Boxes were ruined, but there were pots and jars. Salted venison from bucks - at least the Fusei had kept rations of game. There was plenty, and it would require another trip to drag back more. But at least there was something to accompany the rice, and even a little trout from the river! Perhaps this was not a completely terrible ordeal.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Nori watched the Shogun carefully, wondering what was going on in his head. His eyes were alight, like something was there. Something good, he thought. He remembered this man as a boy, and knew that look.

Casualties of war.\" He looked to the surviving veterans, \"On our way back, we'll see to it that their remains are given full rights.\" In his mind it was one of the many ways he distinguished humans from monsters. No matter what crimes a true citizen of his shogunate would be guilty off, no matter how they died, he would do his best to ensure they received their funeral rights and proper burials.  Still he moved onward and did his best to allow the troops free reign to enjoy the evening as best they could.

No scouts. Nothing. The Fusei had been sent running like frightened children, and they were victorious. They ate well - and for what little sake they found in the ruins, pleasantly warmed after the fires - they drank merrily. Despite everything and in such a good mood, the boundaries of lord and soldier and servant became blurred. Some tried to dance. Some sang. Lord Haitaka was responsible for this good fortune and win, and they reveled in a moment to celebrate with him.Come morning, however, this would have to cease. They all knew this. And come dawn they were stirring and preparing for march and possible battle. Quivers were full and swords cleaned. Armor fitted properly. A hangover or two would pound away. But they were ready and awaiting the command of their beloved leader.Nori had been patrolling for a majority of the night, choosing not to partake in the festivities. He explored much of the surrounding area, seeming not fatigued in the slightest. He found a tiny shrine by the river - a once lovely ceramic figurine of a serene monk in prayer, his hand lifted in polite greeting with a gentle smile on his face. However, someone had broken it - the head lay near the water. It was a miracle the waters hadn't swept it up to carry it off.Makoto came to mind. She was his teacher besides Master Hideaki. Though he hadn't quite understood this whole thing, he felt a certain... respect. He stooped down to pick up the broken piece, and tucked a hand into his pouch. He found a sash, silk black, and mused over this for a moment. He carefully set the head back up on the shoulders of the little figurine and tied the sash about the neck - effectively covering the break and holding it in place. He had a feeling that Makoto would have done the same, and now he had a reminder - this was certainly not left by the Fusei. So this land wasn't always lawless. It was a bit enlightening. Another dip into his pouch found a gold coin, and he dropped it in the little box that sat before the little man. Sure, if the Fusei came back through here they'd likely raid it - but that was for their spirits to curse, not he. He would do right here, for Makoto and the rest of his brothers, and for their Lord.
