Two of the bandits nearly skipped over in excitement - they scoured the surface for any ink or marking that might give a clue as to what was inside, or from what ship did it come from. Perhaps it would be more food, or even goods to be sold. Maybe weapons, if they were lucky.However, there were no markers. The crate itself was well made but not perfect - water was trickling from crevices and running across the planks to the sand. Whatever was inside might be ruined if it was waterlogged.
