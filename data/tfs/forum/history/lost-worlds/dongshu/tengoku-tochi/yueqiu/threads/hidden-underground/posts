These had shown to be used for a number of purposes - one particular time in crushing a massive invasion of the western Fusei with an element of surprise.Now, they are merely myth to most of the common folk. It was decreed they were buried and sealed, no longer needed with such a strong city now standing. But this was not the case. Very, very few individuals have found the exit holes that lead down into the tunnels - which are now used more so for soldier and shinobi movement, or secret transports of other natures. The tunnels that lead up into the palace are barred with heavy doors or slabs, guarded by aforementioned troops for security sake. The rest of the tunnels are generally quiet and undisturbed, save for the few openings found and utilized by the public for movement or storage - or even small niches made for living, by certain individuals usually unaffiliated with the law or wanting to avoid it. They are mostly dark and smell of standing water from the shallow waterways that wind through. The common inhabitant here are rats and bats.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/d8z0A9M.jpg"], "html": "From the time of the first Haitaka Shogun, when the city was first being built from the ground up, there were a series of tunnels that branched and snaked out all across the city - hidden beneath the very streets.
