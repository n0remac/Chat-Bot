A lovely, quiet koi pond sits out front the main doors of the building.Inside there is a large restaurant that spans up to the second floor with a number of tables to seat and serve, ringed about a large stage for dancers and musicians to offer a show to guests. There are also a number of more secluded tables, \"boothed\" corners for quieter parties away from the entertainment. The place is finely decorated with carefully trimmed bonsai trees and foliage, silk banners and paintings as well as lovely water streams and fountains - a very homely and inviting environment to bring a sense of ease to guests. Lovely serving girls bustle about to tend to patrons at the inn, each of them smiling and beautiful and polite.In addition to the serving areas for the general populace, there are secluded private rooms for those looking to be entertained mostly in a party of 1, so to speak. But these are also for small gatherings of a private or personal matter, available for a higher fee.The other major part of the large establishment is the inn, with warm and clean rooms available for those too inebriated to leave or needed a place to rest after an evening of refreshment. There is also a comfortable bathhouse within the back of the establishment, for immediate travelers that need to bathe before turning in for the evening.After such a very relaxing evening, some have no choice but to rent a room for the night - it's very difficult to find the strength to do much else after such a wonderful experience.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/eghxwTw.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/tHyGalW.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/Awt6Bef.jpg"], "html": "Settled well into what might be considered the dividing line of the Aristocratic and Commoner Quarters of the city, amongst the tightly knit houses and tea houses of a hanamachi, is a very large establishment.
