The main entry gate is sheltered within the heart of the palace, and only the Haitaka clan hold a key to get in aside from the shadows within... who generally need no key. The sprawling grounds that hide in shadow beneath the grand home of the Shogun is an outfitted establishment to house and train those sworn in as the Kage no Shogun - the Shogun's Shadows.The Den is well equipped and spacious to train for all sorts of arts of the shinobi here, from sparring rings to target mannequins and bales for tool and weapon practice. There are shadow rooms to train in fighting blind, high ceilings and structures for scaling tests and mobility, a small quiet temple for meditation, and a few other rooms for more intense and cruel training of further arts - usually introduced to those that elevate beyond a status of 'trainee'.Besides these, there are plenty of small bedrooms to house those of the order, an appropriate kitchen to list and stock for a small army, a proper bathhouse - common accommodations for the Shadows so they might not have to surface save for a command or a mission.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/b8lqg7S.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/0uMJ4Ig.jpg"], "html": "<font face=\"georgia\">The second part of the Shogun's Palace unknown by most, and known by only a select few.
