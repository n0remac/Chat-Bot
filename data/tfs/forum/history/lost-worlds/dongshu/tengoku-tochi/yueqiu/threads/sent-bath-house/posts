The ones in the Commoner's Quarter are generally a bit cheaper with basic commodities of bathing and a few private tubs, while the ones more about the Aristocratic Quarter demand more for the larger baths, more private rooms, and spa services.Due to an increase in foreign traffic and more tourists, there have been a few additions to most of the bath houses - namely in helpful, instructional plaques to help direct those not familiar with the customs - such as the direction to the personal showers before stepping into the baths as to help maintain the cleanliness of the pools and spas, and requests to refrain from taking clothes and weapons into the water but to leave them in the provided lockers.
