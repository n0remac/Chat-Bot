Soon more ships would arrive, just to be on the safe side. But in all honesty there would likely not be a need. The \"green flare\" was a response specifically designed to counter supernatural beings. That meant it was time to bring out the metallurgists.The metallurgists were dwarves gifted with a special connection to the earth. They were able to unlock powers based on their proximity towards certain metals. Among the dwarves, metallurgists were their own caste, a social stratum of venerable warriors whose honor was virtually without question. The holy earth itself chose them to protect their race.Preparing their \"green flare\" response meant several things. First, the warriors would load their tension powered ballistic weapons. Second, the remaining crew would reach battle stations, and third, the metallurgists would position themselves in proximity of their respective metals and begin communing with them, charging their power to prepare their interactions.(OOC: \"Seven more ships were approaching on the horizon, and their respective crews were preparing their \u201cgreen flare\u201d offensive.\" This is their charge from the last post.)This all happened the moment they saw the flare.With their powers now fully charged, upon seeing the ship dive underwater, the gold metallurgists on board the vessels would summon sustained winds to bring the rear vessels into a zigzag line formation parallel to the enemy ship's predicted path. The zigzag would make dodging much harder. The silver metallurgists would focus their energies on silver-alloy ballistae, who had the power to harm supernatural beings with heated metals. The nickel metallurgists would focus their energies on another pair of nickel-alloy ballistae, which when combined with the power of a metallurgist would turn water into ice. The lead metallurgists would channel their power onto lead shot, which can increase the density any objects they come in contact with.Every ship could execute the following combination, starting with the lead ship. With one of each type of ballistae on each side of the ships, the nickel ballistae would fire into the water at an angle, creating walls of ice that, when fired upon by relatively tension-powered mechanical launchers of lead shot, would cause an affect that would propagate throughout the ice wall as it formed and increase it in density. This would create a deep sea \"ramp\" which would be much heavier and stronger than normal ice (which had a tendency to float). As soon as the daimyo's ship ran into these ramps, they would be forced to the surface, where the silver ballistae would be waiting to skewer the vessel. If they connected, the silver alloy would release an aura would would weaken and possibly even kill any supernatural presence on-board the ship.If the first ship failed to stop the vessel right in its tracks, ALL 8 SHIPS WERE PREPARED TO ATTEMPT THIS EXACT SAME COMBINATION, OR EVEN MAKE ADJUSTMENTS DEPENDING ON THE OPPONENT'S NEXT MOVE! Of course it was unlikely the enemy vessel would even get passed the first ship since it foolishly increased speed against the armada, leaving it little opportunity to turn.And with the firing of a second flare, more ships were on the way.(OOC: 8 metallurgists per vessel x 20 NPC count x 8 ships = 1280. + 8 ships x 50 NPC count per vessel = 400. Grand total 1680 NPC count. The creator of Alban has given me the authority to use the entire NPC count of Alban, which is 5,000.

The newly formed ice ramp was something Ryuk had never faced before and he was still new to his powers. Such a situation forced him to have faith in this Shinigami. Every second that passed left Ryuk feeling emptier, letting the Shinigami slowly get his way. Ryuk was a young man and such a being knew exactly how to play someone who had lost everything.\u00a0The ship wouldn't collide with the ramp, but it would follow the ramp. This was to prevent the enemy from knowing their location. The ship had reached a very deep depth in a short time, which gave them time to prepare for their strike as they were forced to rise back to the top.The crew on the ship began to mutate and become a zombie like creature of the sort. Flesh and bone were present and the beings wore their tattered clothing. They all seemed to carry katanas and wear samurai armor. These beings were ready to fight, as death had already claimed them and a new being controlled them.The ship itself began to speed up, gaining speed fast as if they were attempting to rocket out of the water. While speeding up, an illusion seemed to occur in front of them. It wasn't anything, just a black blob that was the size of the ship. Using most of the dark magic brought forward from the Shinigami, a plan began to unfold.Ryuk stood up from seat and grabbed the two orbs above his seat. He would begin to make a mad dash for the deck. As he ran, thirty zombies were leaping off the ship and onto the ice. As the zombies made their leap onto the ice wall, the illusion would break the water, and with the force from the quickly rising ship making a disturbance in the water, the illusion was on made more realistic despite it just being a big black blob expecting to be fired on even though it had no definite form.Four seconds after the illusion broke free and was possibly fired on, the real ship would lunge from the water. A massive wave of water erupted as the ship broke free at it's speed. Catching some, but not much air as it rose from the ocean, the remaining twenty zombies began to leap from the ship and onto the closest ships. They didn't seem to move like zombies did, they moved as if they were animals with their mighty leaps. One could expect them to be aggressive and no morals.\u00a0As for Ryuk, he made his leap onto a nearby ship himself. He would probably target the strongest ship to leap on. As Ryuk was running earlier, he had lodged the two orbs into his armor as if the plating had been designed to fit them. A red energy seemed to outline the black armor plating, giving the samurai an even more darker presence. The moment Ryuk left the ship, the ship was no longer empowered by the Shinigami.

There the aura would still trigger, causing the zombies that were no doubt crawling their way up on the ice to begin burning with a heatless flame which could not even be extinguished by water, a silvery white flame like alkali metals dipped in water.The second ballista on the OTHER side of the ship was still ready to fire, but as there was only one enemy vessel there would be no need. Still, as soon as the zombies leap onto the ship, the aura would be triggered regardless. Now the zombies on the SHIP would be consumed by silvery flames until they were reduced to dust. Of course the crew would be just fine, and the ship would not catch fire.If Ryuk himself intended to leap onto a stronger ship, it would probably be the next ship in the line, a frigate. This vessel had the exact same magical defenses prepared as the scout vessel (and superior general defenses). Again, one of the ballista would fire, this time at the real ship, leaving an anti-zombie aura in the middle of the water. But the second ballista on the other side of the vessel would be on stand-by and release its aura, causing significant pain to the possessed daimyo on the frigate.The remaining 6 ships would not stand idle of course. Using the summoned winds produced by the gold metallurgists, they moved into circle formation around the bizarre battlefield. Each of these ships had two ballistae mounted on each side of the ship which were capable of producing anti-zombie auras. The zombies and the shinigami which possessed the Ryuk would be completely quarantined. As an additional precaution, they aimed their nickel-alloy ballistic weapons at the water below their fellow frigate...Speaking of which, the frigate's entire crew, including the powerful metallurgists, would confront the daimyo even as the silvery aura would strike at the shinigami.

As for the zombies on the ice wall, as they began to burn, they would release. They would get away however they could, sinking to the deep voids at the bottom of the ocean. Today was not the best day to be a zombie.\u00a0The zombies on the ships would do the same as the zombies on the ice ramp below the water. They would quickly leap from the ships and plop into the ocean, sinking to the bottom. They couldn't swim since they didn't have any buoyancy, so the the abyss they sunk.Ryuk was a different story. Ryuk stood before them as a living being, needing no magic to sustain his life. The orbs in his armor seemed to pulse violently, as if fighting it's own battle against the aura.

These darts were unique to the Shiniga,hid within his plating in a thin pocket in his armor and dipped in a vile found on the ship that had sunk.\"Your magic might hurt them, but I am flesh and blood just like you. I don't need magic to kill, I can do it by myself.\" Ryuk spoke.Ryuk snapped forward at a breakneck speed. As his first step hit the deck, his right hand slid forward and up towards his left shoulder. In his hand was the set of darts. With his fingers manipulating the angle the darts, Ryuk released the four darts into the nearest beings. As he moved and his hand reached his left shoulder, it would continue to the hilt of shortest of his three Katanas. Anyone and anything from that moment on that got in his non-patterned path across the deck would find themselves dead or missing their shot.

However, there were key differences.First of all, the airship had another gold-class metallurgist on board who had been focusing his energy on a golden fan. He had access to the oil barrel via a special panel on the bottom of the flying vessel. Secondly, the barrel was designed with 4 shorter than average fuses which led into several sub-chambers containing a volatile alchemical compound along with a pocket of air. The primary chamber was, however, filled with a large volume of flammable oil... (This was prepped in the previous turn as the ship was arriving.)As the unbridled samurai hacked and slashed his way against the crew of the vessel, he would no doubt score several kills very quickly. The ship was lost, and the crew knew it. \"Hold him! Hold hi-\" One of them would cry just as he was cut down. \"Code Spider! Code Spid-\" Another crew member would yell to the crew below.The metallurgists below deck would hesitate, but then nod to each other. In service to their race, they would not allow this invader and is evil machinations to come to pass. One of them called out to a nearby crew member. \"Code Spider.\" The crew member, with unwavering loyalty, saluted his masters and fired an enchanted flare out the ballista port. It was red. Half the remaining crew members below deck would get to work, opening up oil barrels and spilling out oil all over the floor with military precision, while the other half joined their comrades above deck who were giving their lives to hold off the daimyo and prevent him from escaping. There were at least enough bodies to entertain him a few seconds more.The red flare was all the signal the other ships needed. Their nickle alloy ballistae which they had already aimed at the water surrounding the vessel fired. This time there would be no lead shot, as these ice structures were meant to float, not sink. As soon as the ballistae from all six surrounding ships struck the water, the entire frigate the daimyo was on would be surrounded by buoyant ice walls which would quickly rise above the deck of the ship, making leaping off into the water to escape impossible... (These were also prepped as soon as the ships arrived as part of the green flare contingency.)When the crew below this ship was done with their foreboding work, they ran up to the deck so that their blood would feed the daimyo's blade. Interspersed among the crew were of course metallurgists, who brought to bear their powers against him as best they could. The gold metallurgists would use golden fans to summon intense winds to try to slow the daimyo down. The silver metallurgists would remain below deck, powering their aura as long as possible to weaken the daimyo. The lead metallurgists wielded axes which, if they struck the daimyo, would slow him down considerably as his armor would become much denser and thus much heavier. The remaining crew would simply continue to fight until their dying breath, their short but fast and powerful statures presenting the daimyo with difficult targets. (These effects are being charged over the course of the battle.)The airship's response to the red flare would be to drop the barrel they had been prepping. Because of the shorter fuses, the barrel would detonate just above the vessel rather than directly on it. The alchemical compound would ignite, break the barrel apart, and propagate sparks across the blanket of oil, causing it to ignite in midair. At this moment the gold metallurgist would release his whirlwind, which fed the oil flames and directed the oil to speed down towards the deck.Seconds later the daiymo would suddenly see a bright red aura all around him. If he looked up, he'd something strange, a great circle of flame quickly cascading down all around him. If he tried to escape it, he would of course see the ice walls which were surrounding him. If any dwarves were left alive, they'd form a perimeter around the daimyo, dog pile him, do whatever was feasible to stop him from trying to leave the ship as the wrath of the airship consumed the deck.Surrounded by a wall of fire and ice, it was extremely unlikely the daimyo would escape. The flames would not melt the ice quickly enough to allow him a way to reach the water, though if that were the case surely the heat would kill him either way. There was also no hiding below deck, as the flames would, fed by the whirlwind, reach the inner hulls (now filled with oil) and consume them.In that instant, the silver metallurgists below deck would be consumed by third degree burns. But before their aura expired and they lost consciousness due to shock, to ensure no evil entity could leave the vessel, five of the surrounding six ships would fire their silver ballistae at the chunks of ice encapsulating the vessel, resulting in a aura almost 3 times more powerful than the original. Each vessel still had a silver alloy ballista on the other side of their ships of course, so they themselves were still protected. (This is of course part of the green flare contingency.)The remaining scout ship, after witnessing the tactic of the zombies leaping off, would quickly realize that the ice wall they had created most likely contained zombies as well. The lead metallurgist would dismiss his power, causing the ice ramp to reach normal density and begin rising, bringing the fleeing zombies back up before they can escape the silver aura. If they tried to escape again by leaping into the water, one of the other ships would fire a nickel allow ballista at the water in front of them and freeze them in place so they can continue to be reduced to ashes. As for the zombies on the scout ship, they would use their own remaining nickel ballista to fire at the water and freeze the zombies in a tomb of ice, so that they would could not escape the aura, which, being magical in nature, would burn them even in the ice. This might create a pocket of glowing zombie within the ice, but the flames would not melt the ice, as they are heatless and only consume the entities they target.(...

Ryuk kept his motion, still slicing his way across the deck. He would press to the rear of the ship as if wanting to look at the ships beside and behind him.\u00a0The fire began to engulf the ship, making his kills much easier. Ryuk himself pushed through the fire, the cloths beneath his plating starting to burn the longer he remained in the flames.The shinigami waited for the right moment, when Ryuk's mind was the weakest from the pain he was suffering as the fire began to break through his armor and burn him. The weaker Ryuk's mind was, the less power the Shinigami needed to extend to take over Ryuk. When the time came, Ryuk was half a second from falling dead, much of his body burned to the bone, his armor holding him together.\u00a0With the ship burning and most of it's crew dead, one could expect the aura it had to be much weaker. The two orbs let out a pulse within the flames when it retook Ryuk's form. Ryuk's body stood back up and made it's way to the rear of the ship. He would stand there, the flames engulfing his body. He stood there looking out, and as he did, a the Shinigami's face was making a presence in the fire that the entire navy could see. A giant skull with Ryuk's helm on that seemed to be laughing evilly.\u00a0Then Ryuk took a dive into the water between the ship and the ice. Between the armor and him having no buoyancy, he would sink like an anchor, leaving the Alban ships strike range faster than they could deploy any magic shots. The orbs would glow a faint red as Ryuk sunk, symbolizing that the Shinigami and Ryuk had survived, but not by much. The Alban had defeated Ryuk for the time being.As for the zombies on the ice below, many would be caught as they rose from the water. A few did escape, but they would either be consumed by sharks, fish, or be crushed by the force at the bottom of the ocean. Those that were eaten would create a new problem down the road, but this deep at sea will keep it from becoming an issue.You win.  -wipes tear of joy from eye.- Twas' fun while it lasted.))", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://storage.proboards.com/5665496/i/QpZzJT39AQ3ewhOwM_Vt.png"], "html": "None would bring down Ryuk, his blade taking their life before they could reach.
