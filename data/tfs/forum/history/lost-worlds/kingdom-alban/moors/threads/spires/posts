Your duty is not the only thing that matters. Oh, it is true, many men and women can perform their duty without any consideration for their own wants and needs.. but you are not one of these people. You have a heart that yearns not for glory or valor, but for acceptance and approval.

The images faded, and Pa'ahl spoke again, his voice soft and solemn.\"All these things you would achieve, but they would not last. If you do this thing out of duty alone, you will drive yourself, and your people to ruin. And I do not speak of only the humans - all the races of Alban are your people. You and that sword you hold are the culmination of the hopes and dreams of all the denizens of this land, whether they be human, Dwarven, Wildling, or Fae. To bring peace to this land and those who dwell within it, you must accept that this is more than your duty, your destiny: To reforge An Dli, to take your crown and your rightful place upon that throne, to bring the races of Alban together once more, you must want it. You must admit to all that it is your will, your desire, your one true wish, to do this thing. But most of all.. you must admit it to yourself.\" His wings curled around Averin in a protective manner as he continued, his voice nearing a whisper.\"You have great strength within you, Averin Arach.
