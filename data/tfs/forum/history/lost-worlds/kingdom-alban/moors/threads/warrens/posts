It is to these caves that the People retreat when the entirety of the Tribe is under attack, the entire species holing up in safety within the subterranean depths. An underground river, fed by the lake, courses through these caves, providing the People with fresh water. The hunters of the Tribe, the Wolves and Hawks, keep this safe place supplied with preserved meat, and the Deer Tribe keeps it supplied with preserved crops, in the event of a need to gather there.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/gUIA4jZ.jpg?1"], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/gUIA4jZ.jpg?1\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/></div>"}}
