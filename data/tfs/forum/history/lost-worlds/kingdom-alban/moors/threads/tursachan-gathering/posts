Unfortunately An Dli, even at the low speed of that swing, gouged its way through one of the armor plates and into Madadh's flesh. It was not a deep wound, but it was first blood. Madadh was quick to release the blade and take a single bound backward, those grey eyes locked on the future king as he spoke. \"Well, boy, you have done well. Very well, actually. Keep the blade up, now.\"<br><br/>With a quick signal from Madadh the leaders of the other five tribes stepped forward; each walked to Averin, slid a hand along An Dli a bit higher on the blade each time, and walked on to take a place forming a circle around the knight. While this occurred, the Hawk and Bear leaders led the others in a wordless chant: the tones carried weight despite their wordlessness, somehow speaking of power. Only Cairex, among the non-wildlings present, would be able to gather much more of it than that. The chant was the other half of the blessing of An Dli; the blood carried the power, while the vocalizations unlocked and shaped it. As the ceremony wound to a close Averin would feel... stronger, more alive. The downside was that things seemed to move slightly more slowly from his perspective.<br/><br/>\"It is done, Averin of Arach, and our deal is made. You will deal with the Fae, one way or another, and we accept you as our king.\" Madadh punctuated his statement with a bow that the other wildling leaders mirrored.</br></font></font></font>"}, "post-38773": {"user": "King Averin Arach", "user_num": 1234, "timestamp": "1463854484000", "message": "Averin watched surprised as Madadh grabbed for the blade.
