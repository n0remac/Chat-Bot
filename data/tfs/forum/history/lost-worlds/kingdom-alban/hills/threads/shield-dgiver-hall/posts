It was built over a hundred years ago by a coalition of humans and dwarves. The structure has a great deal of stylistic flair compared to other dwarven buildings, which instead focus on structural integrity and practicality. Once the hall was a symbol of unity and friendship between the dwarves and humans (who don't mind a little stylistic flair given their relatively short lifespans). But with the loss of An Dli and the ensuing economic depression, the building had become a bit of a laughing stock. Without the desire to please the aesthetic palates of humans, there is no reason to build a structure which will only last a fraction of time compared to typical dwarven buildings.The hall is where the councillors, the leaders of the Merchant caste, typically meet to discuss matters of trade, politics, and the economy. Tradesman and the aides of the others also come here seeking financial advice, loans, and partnerships.AddendumWith King Averin back on the throne and the civil war ended, the population of humans has increased, and dignity has been restored to the hall. More and more people are looking for loans and trade agreements to take advantage of the sudden opening up to the outside world.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://notjustagranny.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/2a-the-guildhall.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://notjustagranny.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/2a-the-guildhall.jpg\" style=\"max-width:60%;\"/></div>"}}
