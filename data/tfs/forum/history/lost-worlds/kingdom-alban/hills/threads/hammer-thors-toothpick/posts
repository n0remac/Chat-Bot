Finger nails, Haha!\" \"...I don't know you...\"Thor's Toothpick is the single best known tavern in all of Hammer. The fact of the matter is that alcohol is a huge industry in dwarfdom, especially for the lower castes. Anyone who's had a rough day mining, smithing, masoning or being yelled at can come and unwind here.The tavern is extremely comfortable and cozy no matter what the outside weather conditions. It is literally built into the side of a rocky hill. Once one enters the building, the sacred rule is all grudges and animosity are left outside the door. Friendly sparring, arm wrestling, and rough-housing are common and to be expected, but genuine fights are strictly prohibited. If you knock someone out, you better hope he (or she) wakes up with a smile on his face! Generally this rule is known as \"trygg plass\". It is also invoked in certain times of negotiation and funerals.There are plenty of spaces for games, singing, dancing, and group gatherings.Humans are generally more welcome than the other races, but anyone can visit the tavern on a busy day and slow nights. However, come end of the week nightfall, if you're not a dwarf, don't expect to even get the time of day.Despite their small stature, dwarves have a surprisingly strong tolerance for alcohol due to their high muscle to weight body ratios and strong livers. They can drink at least as much, if not more, than humans twice their size.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/dragonage/images/0/05/Tapster's_Tavern.png/revision/latest?cb=20131120090949"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/dragonage/images/0/05/Tapster's_Tavern.png/revision/latest?cb=20131120090949\" style=\"max-width:60%;\"/></div>"}}
