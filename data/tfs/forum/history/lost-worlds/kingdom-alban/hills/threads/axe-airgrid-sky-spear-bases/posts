He nodded towards them, pleased.Seeing as it was going to be another few minutes, the admiral decided to have a short chat with Krupp. \"So, this war is over... it's a strange feeling isn't it? How do you feel about trading with foreigners again?\" The admiral spoke with an even, contemplative tone. He seemed to regard Matvey only slightly above himself. The merchants were of a lower caste than the sea guard, but Matvey was also an officer and was well known among dwarfs.

Oh yes, it's great. Personally I owe a large amount of money to a large amount of people. Right now, I have little more to sell than fancy words and the clothes on my back. I've sort of got a deal with the government so that'll give me time, and... well I'm hoping to mosey over to the fae or wildings, see if the gits have anything that's not found anywhere else, anything they have unique. Far as I see it we only have metal and I'm sure by now those outside of our little island have become somewhat independent of us.\"The Dwarf looked a tad embarrassed, for he himself knew the abundant hate speech he screams and violence he commits toward the two groups. \u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Clutching his head and hoping the ringing would stop it was a few moments before he finally spoke to the admiral."}, "post-44822": {"user": "Dwarfs of Alban", "user_num": 1727, "timestamp": "1469087596000", "message": "\"Hmm, yes, a lot of work must be done before Alban is restored to its former glory. Not just the kingdom, but our individual lives. Well, don't fret. You'll be back or your gilded throne soon enough.\" The admiral spoke that last bit with a joking sort of contempt. As he looked upon the ship, he smiled. \"Years of war have made our passion for creation run cold. We've lost sight of who we once were. We were more than just warriors, and we will be more than just warriors again. I'm no economist. If I was I wouldn't have joined the sea guard. But I do know pride. And us dwarfs can do plenty more than mine metal. Think of the bounties the earth is capable of producing. Marble, clay, gemstones. Even plain old stones can be used to make works of art. And we can make more than just weapons and armor with metal. Tools, compasses, heck even toys.\" The admiral got excited. He looked around at the younger cadets. \"You know, I used to think the warlord was foolish for reminding us of what the world was like before the civil war. But now that it's over, really over, now that An Dli has been restored, I can see the wisdom in his lectures. To think someone like me would see more promise in the economy than someone like you. You better get some of your optimism and dwarven pride back if you want to honor your stature, Lord Krupp!\"It wasn't long before Matvey's ship was deemed fit for flight. \"Aye, a beautiful vessel. If only all our naval vessels were as fine as this.\" The cadets saluted the admiral, who saluted back and turned back to Krupp. \"Try to be joyful.

While he raised some decent points, he didn't entirely agree. Optimism like that, thinking anything can be reasonably sold was what made economic depressions.\u00a0\"Admiral, the people out there, there outside of our island have no strife, nothing keeping them busy, mundane monotonous lives, minds that are idle; but they are not stupid. They have long since began fighting for resource independence, each and every one of them. Some of these nations are willfully isolated, could you believe that? These people find ways to get these things, all these funny rocks, all them crops, and so called delicacies. You can only carve strange lines into a slab of rock and call it an 'ethnically unique' good that is worth a lot for so long. At some point, trade gets down to the same type of struggle as war, or trying to find food. You have to \u00a0see what you have the the other buggers do not.I'm hoping the fae have some sort of spices or flowers, or the wildings some sort of pretty animal skins... their own will do, eh!\"\u00a0Silencing himself a little, he looked over the ship he was going to use. A lovely thing, a jack of all trades, good speed, armour, several ballista broadsides, plenty of room for storage.\u00a0\"A little gilding makes any ship more fine, believe you me Admiral!\"Finally he considered the suggestion for optimism.\"Isn't any day a time for celebration? Now, move them Dwarven legs!\"The last part was to his crew. They were a large rag-tag, some in beautiful ornate armour, others wearing nothing but trousers and a decorative gold chain.

The crew would look even more strange when some of the humans the Trader had hired would board. The Trader let the ship fly off, it still had many warehouses and population centres to go to, to finish getting the crew, to get some of the Merchandise. Meanwhile the trader lit up a pipe, for he knew he would soon have to go to that horrid forest, and wished to calm himself.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The trader listened to the words of the Admiral.
