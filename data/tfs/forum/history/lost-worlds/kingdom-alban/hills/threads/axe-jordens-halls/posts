The hall is symbolic for many reasons. First of all, it is not a grand temple, but rather an elaborately carved cave. The humble cave represents the essence of dwarf livelihood, to live as one with the eternal earth. It is also said to be where the first dwarves took shelter as they fled from the beasts of the Wyld. Finally it is where the metallurgists are said to have discovered their power.After entering the entrance, one will find themselves in an elaborate cave system. There are many chambers, including the parliamentary chamber, the meeting place of the Justicars, and the Warlord's chamber.\u00a0A typical meeting between high level authority figuresWhile the chambers themselves are quite comfortable and carefully crafted, the passage ways leading to the chambers still have a raw, natural feel. There is a very good reason for this. The walls are filled with ores of various types, such as gold, silver, and copper. Many of the highest caste members in dwarven society are metallurgists, who can manipulate metal in astonishing ways for self defense. To the dozens of metallurgists who can constantly be found in Jorden's Halls, the cave system itself is essentially a giant weapon. Anyone who would there violate the rule of trygg plass would then have to face the wrath of the earth itself!If you are evil and find yourself in these passageways with a metallurgist, you are surrounded by death.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://s3.amazonaws.com/test.classconnection/310/flashcards/314310/jpg/chaitya-hall-bhaja-india-shunga-1st.jpg", "https://i.gyazo.com/1f55623818491e4ece06dd36eeef0955.png", "https://i.gyazo.com/03bb5d554dc2530635a3b45adf7b72cd.png"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/test.classconnection/310/flashcards/314310/jpg/chaitya-hall-bhaja-india-shunga-1st.jpg\" style=\"max-width:70%;\"/><br><i>The entrance to the elaborate cave system</i><br/><br/></br></div>"}, "post-37109": {"user": "Eirwynn Rodrick", "user_num": 1282, "timestamp": "1462847118000", "message": "The Silver Shrike came soaring in from the site of their battle with the Wyld Archon, filled with its complement of sailors and Averin and his mercenaries.

The little girl seemed concerned and trepidatious, and would continuously tug on the Justicar's armor so that she could whisper into his ear. Even though she had a fairly good idea of what she needed to do, she was still nervous. As Averin came down to meet them though, the girl stared at him with wonder and fear.

With a brave little voice, she said. \"The Justicars want you to follow us into the chamber!\" She then covered her mouth with her hands, realizing she might have spoken a bit too loudly. \"Umm, heh, my name is Queron Thurstan.

There was a polished circular stone table at the center, and a few dwarfs on the sides of the table with scrolls placed in front of them. They were preparing to record this momentous event in history.The little girl spoke up. \"Place your sword in the middle of the table.\" If Averin complied, the little girl would stand on top of the table... or try to... After about three attempts one of the Justicars politely lifted the girl up by her ribs and placed her on to the table. Even historical events could have some humor to them.As she stood over the sword, the dwarf scribes began to write furiously as the little girl began to channel her power into the sword. The sword was struck by a strange aura, a teal mist which caused the mithril in the sword to become highlighted as a sort of glowing patternweld.Then, without warning, the sword would suddenly turn a dark black.It was done.Queron smiled. \"Did I do it?\" The justicars examined the sword closely. To test it, Nachton took a small gold coin (he was not a gold class metallurgist), placed it on the hilt, and handed it to Averin.\"Here, you should be the first wielder of the sword. Call it a superstition.\" If Averin waved it, there would be a mild gust of win.All the dwarfs in the room began to cheer. The warlord looked especially pleased. \"It begins, Averin.
