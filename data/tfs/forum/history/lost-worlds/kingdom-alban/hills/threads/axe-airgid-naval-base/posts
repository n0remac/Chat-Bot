We have a new weapon system that requires the presence of a gold metallurgist to use, but can be used with devastating effect against both air and ground targets. I propose you go to the manufacturing district, have them install it on your vessel, your human and dwarf constructed vessel, and take it into battle against the Archon, who resides close to our base in the middle of the Wyld. Not only will you be removing a serious threat to our people, but you will also be saving the Fae, whether those tree huggers would ever admit it or not.
