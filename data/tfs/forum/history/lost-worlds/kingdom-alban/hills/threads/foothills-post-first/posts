This is where The Moors give way to more mountainous terrain. There are no true mountains in Alban, but some of the hills here come close. They are rich in ore and can be tilled with some success, though the dwarves prefer to scorch patches of The Wyld for their farmland. These lands are the most open to visitors. Though not welcoming the dwarves rarely kill on sight. Still it is not recommended for any none dwarf to travel without escort.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://dawnontheamazon.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/huaraz-peru-chavin-rocky-foothills.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://dawnontheamazon.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/huaraz-peru-chavin-rocky-foothills.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/>"}, "post-35807": {"user": "King Averin Arach", "user_num": 1234, "timestamp": "1462158007000", "message": "Once again Averin reflected on how well things had gone in Sword.
