One of the previous warlords had the audacity to build a barracks in the middle of the Wyld!To be precise, the barracks is located passed the very outskirts of Axe's borders. It takes a rather significant escort \u00a0just to make sure the recruits arrive safely. Once there, the trainees are expected to organize a defense against constant waves of horrific and mighty beasts. Every waking shift returns to their beds covered in blood and gore, while the next shifts eats their gruel and and drinks herbal tea for breakfast, knowing this might be their last day on earth.Every recruit is expected to help secure a kill every single day.The Barracks is easily the most difficult challenge that a young warrior can face. Some dwarves are sent here as punishment, while others are sent as part of elite training. Hence there is a great mix and match of warriors of varying skill levels. Either way, one's honor increases the longer one is able to survive here. Criminals have regained their honor here, and future Justicars have come of age here. Both have also met their end here.It is named Wyldthorn Barracks because it's considered a thorn in the side of the creatures of the Wyld, and because its existence stabs at the enclave. The Fae of the Wyld\u00a0generally do not approve of the Barracks, but will not risk military action against it for fear of inciting the wrath of the metallurgists, whom the Fae fear. Some of the more audacious Fae will come to watch the dwarves do battle against the creatures of their realm. Some will place bets (mostly in favor of the creatures), though the more benevolent ones will offer new dwarven recruits advice on how to survive.Warlord Ei Halvard currently holds the record for longest time survived here, at two years and three months.

His powers are true, and his loyalty is unwavering. Our operation-\"Their talk was interrupted by a massive roar as the bear seemed to be gaining the upper hand. Nachton sighed. Pulling out one of his pewter spheres, he gripped it with all his might and then started walking towards the other side of the compound.\"As I was saying, our ground forces will march towards the archon's lair. You will be following us from above. We will draw it out, and then your people will strike the creature from above. Be prepared to reload and fire again.

As soon as preparations were complete, the ground forces would march along the ground towards the Archon's lair, and the airship would follow above.After an hour or so of fighting through moderately tough wildlide, they would arrive at a particularly nasty section of forest. The floor was covered in vines which practically shivered and writhed with raw natural energy. The insects were several times larger than normal, and they could be seen feeding on massive carcasses of unknown giant mammals. The tree tops could hardly even be seen, so the airship would be forced to pull up higher, out of site of the ground forces.Eventually however they would reach a clearing, which was suspicious considering how much wildlife there was up until that point. As soon as they entered it, shivers would run up the spines of the ground crew and even the pirates on board the airship would feel a foreboding presence. The clearing would be covered in an unnaturally green grass, like giant moss. The overall terrain would also be at a slight incline leading downward, as if the clearing was an impact crater.Both the warlord and the lieutenant briefed their respective crews on what this place was. \"This spot could be best described as a natural energy well, a place that goes beyond the mere intersecting of ley lines. It is here where the archon gathers strength...\"The Justicar grabbed his pewter spheres. The warlord raised his ax. The lieutenant manned the firestorm launcher.Then it came.It started as a distant roar, but then the creature was so large and powerful that it closed the gap in mere seconds. But as soon as the sound was heard the warlord grabbed his ax and cried out a mighty battle cry. His metallurgic powers activated. With his boots he quickly picked up speed. His bronze armor lent him strength to wield his ax, which being a lead alloy suddenly became several times heavier than normal. Even so, he had barely made it a fraction of the way into the clearing when archon broke through the treeline!The grotesque thing was pure teeth, spikes, and spines. It was fused with plant life and was essentially the most alive thing within thousands of miles. Its massive jaws threatened to close in just as the warlord swung his ax into the air. A mighty boom rocked the clearing as the ax connecting, sending the creature recoiling. However, it was not deterred in the slightest and redoubled its attack. Another mighty boom was heard as the might Justicar's spheres slammed into its head. The creature was stunned briefly, but that wouldn't last long.It was at this time that the vines from the outside of the clearing suddenly came out of the tree line and themselves whipped and lashed at the dwarfs and Averin's men from behind.The warlord cried out to Averin. \"Me and the Justicar will keep the Archon busy while the Shrike fires upon it with the cannon and whatever else they've got. You and your men, hold off the vines and watch our backs. Our dwarfs will help you.
