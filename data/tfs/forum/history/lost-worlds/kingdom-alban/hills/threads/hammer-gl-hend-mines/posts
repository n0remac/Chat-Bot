As such, it is one of the deepest mines on earth.The further the dwarves go, the more strange and mysterious minerals they discover. Rare earth minerals like flourite, zircon, and allanite can be found here. Metallurgists will often visit these mines to investigate the possibility of discovering new metals whose power they may wield, although these ventures have all been unsuccessful so far.***In one particular corner of the mine there is an old shaft that has been blocked. Entry is forbidden. Legends speak of a cursed mineral with magic properties capable of destroying civilizations. They say the mineral itself punishes those who approach it with a withering sickness.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://cdn.obsidianportal.com/assets/94105/dungeons_mines.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://cdn.obsidianportal.com/assets/94105/dungeons_mines.jpg\" style=\"max-width:60%;\"/></div>"}}
