When the kind returned it should have prospered and flourished, however, almost a year before that faithful day The Blood Revenants had moved into the village. They didn't take over, they didn't force the inhabitants out they simply moved in. Those who tried to stop them were cut down, those who protested were intimidated, but those who kept their peace found that The Revenants left them alone. After all, those who lived in the Landing were human and Skrag did not condone the spilling of human blood unless necessary. In the year that passed some villagers joined The Revenants ranks seeking the power to avenge themselves just as Skrag promised. Others fled the village and the unsettling new inhabitants for fear of what they might do. Still, others simply contended themselves with the new situation doing their best to go about their day to day lives enjoying the extra protection the crazed barbarians offered, as one may enjoy the protection of a vicious but loyal wolf hound. Then the king came to power and travel became safe again and all but the most stubborn of the normal villagers left to become part of the restoration effort in Avelius, the village was mostly Revenants now the painted figures of the near-feral people haunting the shell of the once near bustling coastal village.Skrag was sitting on the docks when Svorstash finds her, he was often seen there sitting on one of the piers looking at the waves. It was known that in his old life he was a fisherman and it seemed that he took some solace in staring out at the black waters of the Albish coast, the gently lapping waves calming the frenzy of his anger for small moments of time. However, much like the sea itself even when he seemed to be at his calmest a storm could spring up out of nowhere.\"You failed.\" The voice of Skrag is not a human thing it is too raw, too guttural as though he was not used to speaking such a pleasant thing as the common tongue, as though his voice was meant to communicate in a language of primal roars. His back is to her his great ax across his legs his forearms resting on his legs. \"You dare to return without the scent of blood upon you Svorstash? Dare to return without claiming a single life from those wretched mongrels of the moors?\" Each syllable sounds like it pains him to speak it, as though stringing together so many words tests the limits of his ability to hold in his boundless rage. There is no response, no action Svorstash could have taken to stop what came next as he swings around and surges to his feet, towering above her. His face is shrouded by his bearskin cloak only the burning red dots of his eyes visible under the hood of the slain Bear Wildling. A massive hand shoots out to coil about her throat and drag her off her feet to dangle helplessly in his grip. \"Do you forget our purpose?\" His voice grinds out. \"Our troth to see these lands cleansed?\" That hood comes closer and closer to her meanacing in how even this close only the vaguest outline of his features become visible in the dim light. \"Perhaps you need a reminder, a permanant reminder.\" The man's free hand grabs her left wrist and pulls it up, slowly he bends down her fingers one by one until only her ring is extended. Then he brings it close to that hood. She would feel his almost burning hot breath as her finger entered his gaping maw and then with a might snap his teeth come down severing her ring finger in a single clean bite. This close his face is clearer, the black war paint explained somewhat the unnatural shadows but his expression was inhumanly feral and vicious and his eyes really did glow a malevolent crimson like the blood he drank. He spits her finger into the see to be food for the grabs before dropping her to the ground. \"Next time I will not be so merciful, for you will have no excuse to have forgotten your mission.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The little port village of Beggar's Landing had once been the largest refuge for humanity outside of Avelius on Alban.

The guards on patrol seem to perk up as the revenant creeps closer there eyes scanning and alert, it appears as though their blood magic gives them some limited night vision, as they are eschewing the use of lanterns or torches,  though not enough to see the creature while he is still so distance.The arch of lighting strikes the first ballista and the wooden contraption is struck and it splinters under the force of the magical lighting, the men near the ballista getting caught in the arch and dropping. However, the arch that Kahn planned though doesn't occur for two reasons. The first is that the ballistas are not clumped together so the distance between each made the second reason more effective. Bloodmagic wards spring to life in response to former Generals attack, the lighting manages to reach a second ballista to much the same effect before glowing runes of crimson power spring to life and snuff it out.Once of the primary foes of The Blood Revenants are the Fae of The Wylds each member of that ancient race can bring to bear powerful druidic magic and call down the elements to attack. Khan's blast of elemental lighting prove similar enough to these magics to be blocked by the wards after the first hit, while he is outside their circle he can do some damage with elemental magic, and depending on his aptitude with spells he may even be able to tell with some examination that the words would provide little protection against non-elemental magical attacks.Khan's attack would have an unintended side effect of providing a perfect distraction for The Revenant to sneak into the village. Though if he'd been paying attention he'd know that he will have to carefully hide his presence as it seems that barbarians can smell his similar magic, not enough to pin point him but at this close range enough to put most of them on edge.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Even at night, there is activity visible through the mist, becoming more apparent as the mist dissipates to be replaced by the pouring rain a rarity on Albish soil.

It was going to be an interesting evening it seemed, for as he got closer it appeared as though a bolt of lightning gave him the opening he needed to walk right in! How lucky, he thought, for in his arrogance he did not care to know the source of what held the guard's attention.Should nothing be there to stop him, or there was a clear moment in which he could creep through the perimeter even if that meant going within feet of the guards, then creep he would until inside Beggar's Landing proper. Should he actually succeed at this, he would find himself retreating into the nearest dark alley to ponder his next step.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "(Sorry for the long wait for replies. :( )"}}
