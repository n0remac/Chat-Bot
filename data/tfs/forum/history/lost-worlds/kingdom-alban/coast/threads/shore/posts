Some are inhabited some are not. The ones that still hold people are a depressing affair. The fishermen are broken and weary with a haunted look to their eyes. Ever vigilant, always jumpy as though the expect an attack at any time. The ones that are not inhabited are unsettling. Sometimes it is as though an animal attacked. Claw marks on the timbers spatters of blood everywhere. If it was animal though why would the bodies be left behind? Broken piles of limbs left to rot in the sun. In other villages it is as though everyone just got up and left. No signs of struggle, no signs of death, just odd things. A table set for dinner, tools left to rust in the rain, boats only half tied to the dock.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://orig07.deviantart.net/c656/f/2013/116/2/0/shore_castle_by_macrebisz-d6323ue.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://orig07.deviantart.net/c656/f/2013/116/2/0/shore_castle_by_macrebisz-d6323ue.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}, "post-34325": {"user": null, "user_num": null, "timestamp": "1461307244000", "message": "A small boat drifted toward the shore.It was occupied by a single person who stood at the bow, and tipped this way and that as it made its way to Alban's coast, unguided. Its sole occupant did not appear to be a pilot, nor anybody with any business on a boat, especially of that size. The figure was garbed in an outlandish cloak that masked all appearances, leaving two pale-yellow eyes to peer perilously from within the hood.The boat beached itself, jolting the cloaked one forward but not throwing him overboard. He disembarked and examined the abandoned fishing town beside which he had landed. The architecture was unfamiliar to him. It smelt of decay, and from decay came one who caused it. Whether the cause for the unburied bodies was disease or attack, the village was best avoided.

The first time he opened his eyes he couldn't make out anything other than drab colors - it was all a blur. He squeezed his eyes shut and tried again, able to make out a distance of beach stretching on to the horizon. Where was he?Moving hurt. Yet he forced his weathered body to move, struggling to lift himself up onto his hands and then ease up on his knees - his back screaming in agony as a result. The shocks running through his arms was almost enough to put him back in the sand. His head felt so heavy, and waterlogged. Pewter eyes moved along the sand beneath him, and he saw the jagged stone that had been under his shoulder. Glancing to himself, he could see where his left shoulder had taken the blow - the tunic torn, jerkin shifted aside, skin heavily bruised and broken to where he bled. Further inspection showed he was a ragged mess, with several more scrapes and bruises amongst the tattered remains of his clothes. On that note, where was his bag?When he could muscle his way into lifting his head, Josidiah found his bag thrown across the sand. It was only a few feet away, but it might as well have been across the beach. Yet, somehow, by some dull drive beyond his broken soul, he managed to drag himself through the sand to find his bag. What few possessions he had left in his life were in that worn, leather satchel - he wasn't going to continue trudging through this world without them. For now, he had to find some strength to get to his feet... and figure out where he was. Maybe even how he got there.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The first thing to break through the darkness was the sound of waves crashing on the shore. It was loud, almost deafening.

It was very late by this point, past midnight and stretching out into the early hours of the morning. Only a few lit lanterns gave light to the scene, for clouds covered the sky and hit the light of the moon.Within minutes, the crew hauled a long crate up out from under the deck and carried it along the dock until they reached a dirt path by one of the old houses. They lowered it to the ground, took out bars of iron and cracked open the lid by pulling the nails free of the wood. When the lid was tossed to the ground besides them, they looked within at the cargo they had been 'hired' to transport... A pale, well-dressed man as still and silent as death and with eyes that were shut as though sleeping.\"Master?\" One crewman asked, his voice a whisper of fear. He tried a second time, louder this time: \"master?\"Slowly, Leviath's eyes began to open and the relieved sailors released held breath. \"We're here, master, just as you ordered: the shores of Alban.\"Though no single muscle of Leviath's body seemed to move, his entire form rose like a lever to full stature until the soles of his feet were firmly against the bottom of the crate. Moments later, he raised his hand to his heart (a move that made the sailors flinch backwards) and then stepped out onto the ground. \"Good,\" came a voice of power and aristocracy. \"Your tasks now are to watch this place and ensure my means of leaving this dreary island.\"\"Yes- I mean of course, my Lord,\" one told him, then slowly moved off with the others into the village. As soon as Leviath wasn't in sight, they began whispering to one another their plans of scouting and setting up camp in a house near the beach. That made no difference to how well Leviath could hear them, but at least they seemed capable enough to be left alone for a time.The lord of revenants cast his gaze over the surrounding area, but did not stay long enough to complete a proper surveillance. Instead, he raised his arms out to his sides just in time for a mysterious mist to envelope him, swallow him whole and then release him in the form of a group of large, black bats. They took off into the sky, utterly silent, then flew to the distance in the form of a swarm hiding under the cover of the night's clouds.
