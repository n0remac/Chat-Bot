Much like its contemporaries, it does not match the appearance or description of its original namesake. Differently from the other branches, the majority of this tower's facilities reside underground, the upward protrusion of the tower-like structure itself containing a very sturdy gate that allows access to the rocky promontory on top of and into which the Tower facility is built. Inside this large area are a number of carved-out caverns that have been formed into rooms of varying size and use. The structure stands just within sight of the city walls of Avelius and looks out across the lands to the edges of the Moors, the Hills, and even the Wyld across the river, showing solidarity and an intent to protect all the regions and peoples of the land of Alban.The various caverns serve as barracks, armory, stables, and various other necessary facilities for the employees of the Black Tower. While the number of staff at this branch is small compared to both the main and Gauldin branches, there is still a full complement of the usual workers, covering guardsmen, scribes, clerks, and Dwarven smiths. Like the Isra and Gauldin branches, the entire structure is comprised of rune-enchanted stone designed to reach its full capabilities when being filled with mana by specially-trained Black Tower mages.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/pTWWzJH.jpg"], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/pTWWzJH.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/></div>"}}
