Well this was it, show time. He steps out of the carriage and onto the stones leading to the council chambers. Averin feels intensely uncomfortable as he walks towards the open doors. Part of it is of course the crowd. He can feel the weight of their expectation upon him. To them he was something more than human. A hero, a symbol of hope, the person who had freed them from oppression and war. That was a lot of pressure for any person. Even to someone who had been raised to bear it, which he hadn't. He had only been raised to reclaim the throne, he didn't know how to sit on it. He had only what he'd gleaned from his own initiative. So now he was going from the leader of a handful of mercenaries to an entire country. With only the beginning of an idea of what he was doing. So yes, that made him a little uncomfortable. Surprisingly though, it wasn't the main source of his discomfort. The main source was his clothing.Their had been a lot of internal debate for Averin over what to wear to the coronation. His first thought had been his armor. The armor looked kingly and he was used to wearing it, he was comfortable in it. To be fair not comfortable in the sense that is was pleasant to wear. It was armor it was heavy, cumbersome, and occasionally stiflingly hot. It was just the comfort of familiarity. He had decided though that the armor sent the wrong message. He had worn the armor nearly constantly since arriving on Alban. He had worn it because they were at war and he needed to win. He had won the war though so wearing the armor seemed too aggressive. People might think he didn't feel secure in his victory.For his coronation Averin had a new suit of clothing tailored. The style he went for was on the boarder between kings regalia and soldiers uniform. A crimson button up shirt, with a high collar, matching trousers, knee high black boots, and a white and gold belt round his waist. Over top he wore a blue coat, similar to that of the city guard. Though this coat was trimmed with gold around the cuffs and seams. With this choice of attire he hoped to convey a balance. The militaristic cut of the ensemble hopefully showed his strength and discipline. That he was still the man who fought a dragon. While the regality of it showed he was confident in his rule. That he didn't think he needed armor for he was the king. Whether or not that message would be conveyed though was anyone's guess. The clothing was stiff new and made of sturdy wool, so it was uncomfortable to wear. Which was more immediately distressing to Averin than the fact that he may be in over his head. Left hand resting on the pommel of An Dl\u00ed, right hand raised to wave at the crowd, Averin begins to walk toward the council halls. They certainly were loud. The roar of the crowd wasn't dimming as he walked. Indeed if anything it seemed to be getting louder. He'd never been cheered before and he honestly wasn't sure he liked it. Still he managed to keep an almost natural smile on his face. He'd kept his cool in front of Ailion\u00f3ra, Madadh, and Ei. He wasn't about to crumble from open praise. As Averin reaches the doors they are flung open revealing the council chambers. These were almost as packed as the street outside. A mix of Albish nobles, affluent merchants, foreign diplomats, and even royalty. Averin spots his former master and he flashes Renaux a quick apologetic grin. He probably should have mentioned his heritage the last time they talked. The soon to be king finishes surveying the crowd and then continues his walk.

Owein he know by reputation. The most powerful wizard in the city, leader of the mages of Talveron. He didn't know what to make of the man. He certainly seemed like the powerful wizardly sort and his attire certainly screamed red wizard. Averin's eyes then drift to the girl... No after a moment he amends that. He didn't know who she was, but she was most certainly a woman. Pretty one at that. He wonders why she was chosen to hold the crown. He supposed it didn't really matter.Owein starts speaking and Averin lowers his head. Well all those words certainly made him sound impressive didn't they? Averin itches to stand up and move. This whole ceremony was making him more and more uncomfortable. It takes all his considerable discipline to remain still until Owein approaches the last words of his speech. Averin tilts his head up so the crown can be placed upon his brow. As Owein drops to his knee, Averin rises and turns to face the crowd. Every citizen of Avelius that he can see is kneeling.Despite their positions many of the people are still staring up on them. Their eyes are wide and hopeful. This is the part he was least looking forward to. It was time for him to make a speech. One had been written for him with the councils help. He had practiced it over and over until he had it memorized. Now though, he'd be damned before he could recall a single word. He sucks in a long deep breath, steadies his shaking nerves, and opens his mouth. Then he closes it. The people look confused, what was their new king doing? Letting out a sigh he opens his mouth again and this time words come out. His voice is strong and firm. Thanks to the magic it carries out across the city.\"People of Avelius, I had a long speech prepared for you. It held many flowery words and many high promises. It sounded very regal and made me seem very kingly. I am not going to give you that speech.\"He pauses takes another breath and lets those words sink in. The crowd begins to murmur and the council is looking at him aghast.\"A kingship is just a title. My father was a king and he died, killed by a greedy man who wanted power. Killed because he may have been a king, but he was no leader. Alban does not need a king, it needs leaders. Leaders are people who know that words only go so far. They are people that understand that it isn't enough to just say something. Leaders understand that you have to act, that it isn't to say you are in charge, you have to show people that you are in charge. That you are worthy of being in charge.\"Averin snaps An Dl\u00ed out it's scabbard and holds it aloft. The power radiating from the blade is a palpable force. So strong that everyone in the city can feel it.\"This is proof that I am no mere king. I am not a man that will bandy fancy words and make empty promises. This is An Dl\u00ed! The sacred blade that brings stability to our lands. I lead men and met with the three nations and when I approached them I did not bargain. I did not cajole. I asked them what I needed to do to earn their trust. Then my men and I did it. Whatever was asked of me, we did. I took action and my men followed me because they believed in me.\"Averin snaps An Dl\u00ed back into it's scabbard. His voice is still firm, still in command.\"Today you have made me your king. It is a title I accept because I understand the symbolism behind it. I will not however make promises. I will not give you pretty words about how things are going to change. I do not know the future, I do not know what will come. The only thing I know is that I will not just be a king. I will be a leader.\"With that Averin marches down the path through the crowd.
