Magical warfare was never my thing. But I will say this. The king and his sword have many fans and supporters, even among the other races. You don't want to alienate the people with anything you say. I think whatever you do should be framed as working in harmony with the sword, not replacing it... at least, until you figure out the attitudes of the party you're dealing with.\"Ying-Na narrowed her eyes as the last pastry was taken from her.

Given the information you\u2019ve just shared, and the details we\u2019ll learn in our meeting with them, it wouldn\u2019t be difficult for Jun to introduce herself as a great hero. For as much adventuring as she\u2019s done in the past, at this point she is now associated with The Land Tillers, Isra, as well as my own, personal authority. ... Very few can claim the same. Further, she\u2019s accrued quite the list of accomplishments and has been, directly and indirectly, involved with saving thousands of lives. It might not be how she considers herself, but Jun\u2019s talents are, in my opinion, the most tangible sort of individual power or prowess. A warrior may be skilled at swordplay, and a craftsman may be capable of producing fine products, but I would be willing to bet Jun is capable of moving mountains. Unless these dwarves have some archaic disposition against magic, or... women, or... crows, I think that they would afford Jun an appropriate amount of respect.\"As an afterthought, Naoki adds, \u201cThey would be foolish not to.\u201dAfter giving that a moment to settle, Naoki raises her hands to clap once, and turn slightly in Gothmog\u2019s direction as she continues, \u201cIn any case, we\u2019ve concluded our business in Avelius.
