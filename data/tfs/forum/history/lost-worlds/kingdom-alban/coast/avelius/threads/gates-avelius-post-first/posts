Well he guessed he'd need to figure that out soon, because he still wasn't sure. Being king seemed like a lot of work and he wasn't sure he could do it. He had spent his life learning how to take the crown, standing here now he realized he had no idea what to do after he had it.Shoving all of that aside for the moment Averin raises An Dl\u00ed above his head. Energy doesn't collect within it, it didn't siphon power from The Wyld like some thought. No, An Dl\u00ed was The Wyld. It was the heart of the massive forest and it bowed to him. He was an Arach, it was his power to bear. As he swung the blade down in a vertical chop the forest around him parted and retreated. It took the combined power of all the mages of Talveron to keep The Wyld at bay. With a single swing Averin sent it into retreat. Averin stared at the field he had just created. His men staring wide eyed at what he had just done. The watchmen along the wall of Avelius and the farmers in their field undoubtedly saw it as well.
