However, she recovers far quicker and within a moment she has moved in. The older woman, who is quite a bit shorter than Moon, takes Moon by the chin and looks at her.

He met Moon a little more than a year into his travels, so he starts with what happened after he left Alban. His first step was Gauldin which was mostly uneventful, outside of helping to defend a small town from an orc attack. After Gauldin turned up nothing, he had traveled to Katahshima. The land was in the midst of a civil war and apparently he had fought in a few battles before leaving for the mainland. On the mainland he had gotten roped into helping a group of hunters take down a wyvern.\"And after the hunt I heard some men talking in the tavern. They spoke of a powerful magical blade in a wood to the north. So that is where I headed next. It was there I met Moon...\"He trails off to look lovingly at her.

Guilt that she was disappointing him, since he clearly very much liked to see her in this dress.. and fear that he would be angry with her for being unappreciative. Once again, she felt as though she didn't deserve him. He was nobility.. she realized that now. And she was.. nothing. A woman with no home, with nothing to her name, of less than common birth - a savage from a far-flung tribe.
