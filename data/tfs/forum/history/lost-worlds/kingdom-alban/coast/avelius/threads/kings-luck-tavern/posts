I suppose I've always been fond of green if you pressed me on it. Favorite food would have to be... There was this place in Gauldin that sold these things... They were like a pocket of dough, wrapped around sliced meats covered in cheese, tomato sauce, and vegetables and then baked in a stone oven. I loved them so much I would get them whenever I could. Though I could never pronounce the name. I already have a baby dire bear and a baby dragon, so I am good on pets. As to my favorite memory...\"He thinks about saying something corny.
