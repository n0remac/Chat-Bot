It seemed he did not have so much diplomatic experience, which made sense when the Chancellor considered that the island had been isolated for much of living memory.Halvard's face remained as stony as ever. But to be frank, he was quite relieved. It was nice having a civil conversation with a human for a change, and about something other than the weather or how things used to be (a topic which quickly fell out of favor anyways as fewer and fewer humans remembered what things were like before the war). His eyebrows waggled a bit when he heard that the leader of this \"Isra\" wasn't human.\"I'm afraid the girl's role in this was hardly a matter of choice, but she seems to be taking it rather well. I think she may be too young to understand the significance of her contribution.\" If Ryden turned to glance at Queron and the Justicar, he'd see them laughing and joking together.

He was very perceptive, indeed. She'd expected him not to take an interest, and she'd been proven wrong. She'd hoped he had the makings of a great king from the start.. and he was rapidly proving that her faith wasn't baseless. Removing her hands from the teacup, she instead folded them in her lap and squared her shoulders as she responded to his words.\"You're correct, Your Majesty. I did initially come here with the intent of seeking some sort of assistance from you as it pertains to my people. They are my family - the only family I've ever known. They found me as a babe on the outskirts of the city, left to die, and took me in. They chose me as their leader but a few short months ago, and I've been doing all I can to change how the people perceive us, to protect my order.. to no avail. The priestesses can't go anywhere alone within the city, and even groups aren't necessarily guaranteed to be free of attack. Many times over the past few years have the priestesses been found beaten and raped and left to die in alleys. And four years ago, our temple within the city was ransacked and destroyed. We've been taking refuge in houses when we can, but no one will provide us with shelter for long.. the danger of violence is too strong. No one is willing to listen when we try to speak. They all think we're Wyld worshipers, that we were trying to destroy the city and let the Wyld take over the whole nation. All I wanted to ask for is your help - perhaps a proclamation that the order isn't connected to the Wyld, that we don't worship it, that we're not to be feared and shunned. If you can spare the men, a small guard on the temple while we attempt to rebuild would be most helpful. A show of support from you would go a long way toward helping us, Your Majesty. We just want to live in peace with our neighbors and feel secure to practice our religion in freedom and safety.\" Her gaze fell again, and she sighed softly.\"..But when I entered this room and saw the strain you were under, I couldn't bear to lay even more weight upon your shoulders, Your Majesty. You are still new to the throne, there are things which require your attention, things that are much more important than an outcast order of priests and priestesses. And so as much as my people need me, the denizens of this nation - human, Wildling, Dwarf, and Fae alike - need you even more.. this is a fact I cannot ignore, nor would I. Thus, rather than asking for your help, I changed my mind and decided to offer my own instead.

He was very perceptive, indeed. She'd expected him not to take an interest, and she'd been proven wrong. She'd hoped he had the makings of a great king from the start.. and he was rapidly proving that her faith wasn't baseless. Removing her hands from the teacup, she instead folded them in her lap and squared her shoulders as she responded to his words.<br><br/><font color=\"9C56FF\">\"You're correct, Your Majesty. I did initially come here with the intent of seeking some sort of assistance from you as it pertains to my people. They are my family - the only family I've ever known. They found me as a babe on the outskirts of the city, left to die, and took me in. They chose me as their leader but a few short months ago, and I've been doing all I can to change how the people perceive us, to protect my order.. to no avail. The priestesses can't go anywhere alone within the city, and even groups aren't necessarily guaranteed to be free of attack. Many times over the past few years have the priestesses been found beaten and raped and left to die in alleys. And four years ago, our temple within the city was ransacked and destroyed. We've been taking refuge in houses when we can, but no one will provide us with shelter for long.. the danger of violence is too strong. No one is willing to listen when we try to speak. They all think we're Wyld worshipers, that we were trying to destroy the city and let the Wyld take over the whole nation. All I wanted to ask for is your help - perhaps a proclamation that the order isn't connected to the Wyld, that we don't worship it, that we're not to be feared and shunned. If you can spare the men, a small guard on the temple while we attempt to rebuild would be most helpful. A show of support from you would go a long way toward helping us, Your Majesty. We just want to live in peace with our neighbors and feel secure to practice our religion in freedom and safety.\"</font> Her gaze fell again, and she sighed softly.<br/><br/><font color=\"9C56FF\">\"..But when I entered this room and saw the strain you were under, I couldn't bear to lay even more weight upon your shoulders, Your Majesty. You are still new to the throne, there are things which require your attention, things that are much more important than an outcast order of priests and priestesses. And so as much as my people need me, the denizens of this nation - human, Wildling, Dwarf, and Fae alike - need you even more.. this is a fact I cannot ignore, nor would I. Thus, rather than asking for your help, I changed my mind and decided to offer my own instead. I know what it is to have that responsibility on your soul, the knowledge that people are depending on you, albeit my experience is on a much smaller scale. It is a burden I would not wish on anyone, but one which I know must be borne. Some are fortunate enough to not have to carry that weight alone.. a King, above all others, should be so fortunate.\"</font> She knew this was the right thing to do. And the order would understand.

Indeed it takes all of his self-control not to shout for his guards. To have her brought before him so he can make her pay for her father's sins.

His hand unconsciously curls around the hilt of An Dli. The swords magics responding to his emotions making the very stones of castle tremble with his rage. He takes a long shuddering breath trying to regain some semblance of control. His voice is bitter with anger and regret.\"I didn't get to know them Owein. My brothers, my sisters, my mother, and even my worthless father. All dead while I was still in the cradle. I was robbed of my family! And maybe another child might have gotten an adopted family I didn't. I was raised by the royal fucking guard. From the earliest days, I can remember those men acted as though I was their prince. Raising me to rise above them. Raising me to do one fucking thing take this god forsaken country back. Make it whole again. Do you know what it's like? To be five years old and see a mother embrace her child. To know you will never get to experience that. To see a father teach his son his trade. Knowing yours was too weak to save your family. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THAT'S LIKE!\"Again the king roars at the wizard, the castle trembling again. This time, he punctuates his statement by slamming his fist onto his desk. The desk breaks apart under the blow. The explosion of wood and splinters seems to take some of the wind out of Averin's sails. The king falls backward to slump into his chair.\"You wanted to play a part in his death? I didn't just want that. I wanted to see everything he owned destroyed, everything he loved turned to ashes. I wanted his head left on the city gates to rot. His body thrown to the pig to devour. I wanted his name, everything he was, everything he had ever been stricken from the annals of history. Some nights the thought of taking my revenge was the only thing that kept me going. Then when I was thirteen I found out he'd died. He'd been dead eight fucking years by the time I found out. So I had to learn how to live without revenge. Now I could take it. Just the barest measure of revenge against the man who took my family from me. And if I do it I become a monster because I hurt someone who doesn't deserve it. What kind of justice is that Owein? Why the fuck am I even here? I never wanted this fucking crown.\"Averin takes the crown from his head and tosses to the floor. Then he draws An Dli.\"When I was six years old I thought there was a monster in my closet. I was so scared I begged, I begged Sterges to stay with me. You know what he said? He said I was to be king. That king's didn't get to be afraid. That they had to be strong. Then he pressed An Dli's hilt into my hands and told me that if there was a monster I should kill it.\"Averin lets out a joyless laugh and in a fit of rage throws the sword as hard as he at a nearby wall. The blade impacts the stone passing through effortlessly to sit buried within the wall. \"Fuck that sword. Fuck this kingdom. I should have let it die. I should have just stayed a mercenary. I have done nothing but my duty and I all I have gotten in return is more duty. More responsibility. I've gotten nothing for myself. No joy, no happiness, no love, no revenge.

And a bit of disappointment. He was silent for several long minutes after the monarch's tirade ended, and then he sighed.\"Actually, Your Majesty, I know very well what that's like. I, too, had to grow up knowing that I would never get to experience the joys of a family. My mother died birthing me.

Should it be liberated, he'd turn and shift his grip to the blade, offering the hilt to Averin; if not, he left it where it was, but adjusted to look at the king nonetheless.\"I understand your life has been difficult. And that you didn't want any of this. But you're not alone. You don't bear these responsibilities on only your shoulders. You have your councilors, you have your knights and wizards, you have the Keeper, you have Caridwyn, and you have me. I may not be the family you wanted, but I'm still standing right bloody here.

He was trying to get the boy to see sense, and quite frankly, to get him to stop throwing such a pity party. Because that's all it was: An overblown, royal tantrum. For good reasons, admittedly, but it still had to stop.\"So things haven't been going your way. Well then change it. You've fulfilled your destiny, Averin Arach. You're a king.

While there have been a few wealthy and/or foolish merchants who have carried goods from Isra to Alban and vice versa, the market is unregulated and the route is unsafe. Hundreds of miles of open, unsafe ocean lie between Port Silverion and Alban, so convoys would need to be organized by the states to offer any pretense of safety. It is the job of a merchant to weigh risk and reward, and at the moment, the majority of Isran merchants think the risk of sailing to and fro from Alban outweigh the potential profits, seeing as how Alban is still largely unknown and not quite a shining example of a strong economy. To begin trade in any real capacity, some manner of an agreement would need to be forged in an official setting, and without one state sending the other an embassy, that becomes somewhat difficult.

The first impression that jumps to mind is that Alban is far more intrinsically linked to powerful magics than she might prefer. In her experience, magic is a powerful tool, but an excessively difficult one to control. It must all be very well and good for Averin here, but how much of Alban\u2019s current state of peace is based on mutual respect, understanding, and cooperation, and how much is inspired by the fear of what Averin might do to one who poses a threat to his rule? And though fear is technically a form of respect, it\u2019s not a friendly one. It sort of pre-empts the concept of revolution or any major change the current King isn\u2019t in favor of. Come to speculate some, that may very well have been how the last peaceful period of Alban ended. Some stubborn king, and some divisive issue. But then, given this information about An Dli, does it paint Alban as a very stable country or an excessively unstable one?It\u2019s hard to say, Naoki thinks. But major disagreements will happen with or without a magic sword, and if Averin dies without a suitable successor, that seems like preeeety much it for a united Alban.

Though\u2026 in a council setting, you\u2019re setting the various races up lots for conflict and friction over major issues immediately. In a civil setting, granted, but if a race\u2019s quick-tempered leader attends instead of sending a competent diplomat, that might stir up issues that escalate beyond the council table. Especially so because it is my assumption that the current set of leaders are the very same who were warring amongst themselves prior to your arrival, and most likely still harbor considerable animosity toward their neighbors. As such, I think that it might be preferable to not proceed directly to a council\u00a0but rather begin with some manner of congress, where the races can coexist, be civil, and get a good grasp on modern diplomacy, notably without the power to immediately drive Alban into the ground. Discussing relatively small matters won\u2019t lead to as much conflict, I would think. From there, if that works well for a good length of time, one could then transition the congress to a council, with power over the state. You might do well to consider such options that may be preferable in your very unique situation.\u201dHoping her sincere and friendly advice had come off as such, Naoki continues, \u201cFurther, It\u2019s my thought that if civil war does break out again, rather than being the isolated conflict it was, the races of Alban may very well appeal to the nations of the world for assistance. There\u2019s not any harm in asking, and foreign influence could easily turn the tides of any inter-racial conflict here. It would be a good move to make, I think. In that situation, a race not having signed or acting in defiance of The Accords would be viewed with much categorical distaste by world leaders such as myself. If one\u2019s options as the leader of their people are to act with civility and receive aid, or don\u2019t and not, I think most would choose the former, and for this reason and similar ones, I don\u2019t expect very much resistance to signing The Accords from the races that have yet to.\u201dIt is at this point that Naoki\u2019s habit of speaking with her hands overtakes her graceful behavior.

Be careful when dealing with them and don't show any weakness. Their current leader Madadh is one of the wolf clan.

Also, most of them are actively hostile, aggressive, and have been nursing grudges against each other for longer than you and I have been alive. Right now I have three leaders who are somewhat peaceful and reasonable, if I involve more members of each race who knows what might happen and I haven't even touched on how humans feel about the other races.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Averin nods along with what Naoki has to say when she is finished he nods, but waits for her to says everything she has to before he offers comments.
