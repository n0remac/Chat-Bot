The one whose hand she removed got slit open from pelvis to chin and toppled in a flood of organs, and then she was moving on to the next. Working in concert with Cairex, when he took out a troll's knee and it crumpled in agony, she was quick to relieve it of its head. Well.. mostly, anyway; a thin bit of muscle and skin at the back of its head kept it hanging on, somewhat. She took stock quickly - three trolls left.
