It's not unlawful to kill one (for a Fae, anyway), but it's highly frowned upon, as they are small in number and extremely hard to train. They come in four varieties; the plain leopard, the plain tiger, the black panther, and the black tiger, in scaling levels of rarity. Being able to find, capture, and train a black tiger is seen as a sign of great skill within Fae society.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/vRiZ0lL.jpg", "http://i.imgur.com/y1GnHC8.jpg", "http://i.imgur.com/1FdHjsp.jpg", "http://i.imgur.com/VemPXws.jpg", "http://i.imgur.com/wFkjQ1P.jpg"], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/vRiZ0lL.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/></div>"}}
