A stretch of wilderness where dragons made their home. The trees were burned and smoldering, even the rapid growth of The Wyld insufficient to drown out dragons flame.

He found the den and as best he could, concealed himself behind rocks as he peered in. Empty. That was good, better than he had hoped for. Even if the dragon returned while he was inside it was fine.

He could feel the Wilding blood magic pulsing in his veins. His senses sharpened and his muscles thrummed with energy. His thoughts drift briefly to Madadh and The Wildings and the promise he made to them. He pulls a bar of nickle from a pouch and pressed it to his unsheathed blade.
