She remained amicable and stoic despite feeling intimidated. The druidic magic coming from the Mor Crann was palpable, like steam from a volcanic vent. Her frame and physical strength (which clearly she made no attempt to hide) also imposed even on the burly male earth mages of the Land-Tiller's Saskatoon clan. Alanis' own garments consisted of her standard white silk gown which, while more modest than Ailionora's, still left breathing room for her arms and ankles so that she could maneuver through jungle. Alanis was suddenly aware of how out of place she looked among the rest of the crowd, who were more suitably in leathers. And yes, she was a tad bit jealous at the Fae Queen's cleavage. Again, none of this showed on her actual visage.\"Mor Crann, we're here simply because we wish to learn more about the Wyld itself. We wish to understand nature in its rawest and most powerful form. The Expanse is tame and kind-hearted compared to this place. I suppose the proper term for us would be explorers. However, if possible we would also like to gain your friendship and respect.
