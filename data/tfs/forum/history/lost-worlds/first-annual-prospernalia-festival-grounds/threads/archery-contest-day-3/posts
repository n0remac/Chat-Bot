She is wearing the same green and gold gown as she has for the majority of the festival so far, with the addition of archery gloves. As is the trend, guards are not long behind them, eyes always open.During a relatively quiet period shortly after the completion of the Dawnfire Forges complex, the High Lady decided on a whim to take up archery, to have at least one hobby she could discuss in public. She provided the best Bowyer in the Forges with the wood of an ancient yew tree, and the result was the bow she carries with her today. It lacks any supernatural properties, runes, charms, or anything of the sort, but as far as the mundane is concerned, it is extraordinary, a product of an artisan and among the finest money can buy. In this instance, there is an additional member of Naoki's entourage walking alongside the guards: a young man dressed in white robes, of the same sort one might see around The Citadel assisting officials with the most mundane tasks of transcription or message delivery; an aide. However, this fellow here seems to be carrying Naoki's quiver; today, a caddy.With a gesture, Naoki sends the caddy off toward Ganymede Galaii  to inform her that The High Lady will be participating - which he does with minimal stuttering and only as much ogling as he suspects the Minister will enjoy.Meanwhile, Naoki has other things on her mind. Namely, turning swiftly about in an attempt to catch Kate partially by surprise by leaning in, to -conditions permitting - share a brief but passionate embrace. (Holding the bow off to one side as not to strike anyone with it.)This, Naoki decides, is perhaps her favorite aspect of Prospernalia. As opposed to any formal celebration with stuffy dress codes wherein one is expected to exercise court manners and follow procedures, here, no one is wearing much of anything at all, and semi-random displays of affection are arguably a part of the celebration. It could all perhaps, be a bit cleaner, and not take place in what is usually a corn field, Naoki thinks, but even so - she's willing to overlook that.\"Wish me luck,\" she says, beaming as she pulls away. With a silly sort of self-contented grin on her face, bow in hand, and guard and caddy in tow, High Lady Naoki makes her way over to the designated line. There, she takes the next available position at the end of the line, next to someone she had seen participate in the joust yesterday.She casts an eye down the line of already assembled contestants, but only recognizes Analiese personally. The Centurion's antics elicit a sharp exhalation from the High Lady. The difference between on-duty and off-duty never fails to amaze her.

She gave him a little wave of her fingers, something warm in her gaze as the almost-naked nymph gestured for him to take his place. An attractive blonde woman came next, and Gany nodded her way, glancing down at the flax at her hip as she passed by. A bold centurion came forward, and she had Ganymede's attention as she gave a speech.\u00a0FOR BOOZE!\u00a0she called, and Gany laughed and clapped her hands as it made the crowd gathered roar and cheer. Clearly, this Centurion would be a crowd favorite. Still, Gany had to turn her dark-eyed attention onto the others that were coming forward to take their place for the Archery contest, and it settled on the stiff elf that had also signed up for the Joust. Gany smirked to see her, and gestured her on through.A look of delight came onto Gany's face to see Kelly the Bandit come forward, and she glanced around to see if that dwarf was also around. She couldn't see that Bella was there, but she was no doubt within the crowds to watch. Gany winked\u00a0in Kelly's direction and waved her forward.

She had a finger to her lips, and the crowd hushed, hushed, hushed.She spoke gently. \"We shall see, now, if their talents surpass their bravery. Fletchers!\" She called to the men that came out and correctly positioned the targets, sending them a few ways back to up the challenge of the \"close-range\" round.\u00a0Ganymede moved out of the way then, passing by @banditkelly  and giving her another little pinch as she did so. From behind them, she took a seat, crossing her legs, chairs set up beneath the shade for people of importance, like Naoki's lover, or even the Queen of Prospernalia, Elizabeth Finch  to join and watch.\"Archers, take your position!

Adopting the pose an archer, she looks downrange toward the target, only a short distance away. Truthfully, Naoki spent the majority of her time in practice with targets at much longer ranges than this, targets this close do not appeal to her. That means that this ought to be easy, but operating outside of one's comfort zone never is. Her thought process still involves arcs and the wind and such, and the power of her bow is far greater than is necessary for this situation.

Naoki extends her ears upward and her tail out behind her for balance - it's a good thing no one is behind her - simply out of habit.

It seemed that it was run by air, making the light targets bounce without as much rhyme or reason as, say, a target on a stick or a string. The targets were much like balloons, and would have to be hit and popped from a greater distance than even the long-distance had been.The crowd made their bets on who they thought would be able to make the shot, and the steward turned to Ganymede and bowed his head, quickly moving out of the way of the Archers.
