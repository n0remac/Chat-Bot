THe servants themselves were coated.\"Citizens!\" She called, and would throw up her hands, flower blossoms somehow sprouting into the air like fireworks as they drifted all around.

Win 25 gold coins, and this--!!\"She held out her hand, and a Sakandi vial dropped from her fingertips, caught by a chain around her wrist. \"Sakandi Water, brought directly from the mysterious desert city thousands and thousands miles away.
