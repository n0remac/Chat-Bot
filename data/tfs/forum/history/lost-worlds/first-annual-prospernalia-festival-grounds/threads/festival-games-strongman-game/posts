This is easily the most entertaining thing she's seen in the past month. These massive hunks of men, mashing and bashing away with the hammer that seems almost a toy in their hands, struggling with all their might to raise the little weight to strike the bell. It seems as if they might break the game before they win. But they do - eventually. It seems to Naoki as if they were taking the name of the game too heavily, and focusing on applying as much force as possible to the center of the striking bit at the bottom. Perhaps if one were to instead focus on speed, and strike the side of the striking bit closest to them, the lever would raise the weight more quickly, and send it into the bell more reliably. After a few minutes, now that the heavyweights have finished, claimed their prizes, and departed, so too have the majority of the bystanders. On an impulse, Naoki decides that she will attempt the strongman game. Reaching one hand into the pouch on her hip, Naoki extracts a single golden coin. Though the price is only one silver per attempt, and Naoki does not intend to make a fool of herself, she stopped carrying silver coins years ago.Coin in hand, she makes her way over to the booth and levies a smirk at the young lad running the booth. Of all the individuals he may have expected to encounter, Naoki doubts she was among them. Silently, she places her coin on the counter and takes the hammer from where it rests on a hook. Holding it in one hand, Naoki swings it about a bit to get a feel for the weight. It feels heavier than it should - as if there may be weights inside the hammerhead. Holding the hammer by the very end of the handle, she extends her arm fully and adjusts her footing such so that everything will line up as she intends it to. She then grips the hammer in both hands, checks to ensure no one will be struck, and takes her swing. qLW7YAz717-201-20", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Ganymede was entirely correct, Naoki decides.
