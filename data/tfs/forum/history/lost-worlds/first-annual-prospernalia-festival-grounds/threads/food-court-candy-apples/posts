They feel different from yours, I think they are better because they are furry!\" She declares happily. Meanwhile, the other children are looking at her dress and any equipment she might have, curious to see elven made items.\u00a0Fortunately, their father finally decides to intervene. \"Naoki!\" A stern voice calls and the little girl who was far into Eilagwen's personal space looks up and grins sheepishly at her father. \"And the rest of you, leave her alone she is trying to eat.\" He admonishes and the children let out a little groan as they slowly back away from the elf under their father's watchful eyes. \"Sorry about that,\" Alden says offhandedly giving the elf a slight nod and apologetic smile.\u00a0", "link_list": ["/post/65137/thread"], "image_list": ["//storage.proboards.com/6046952/images/uCQvKjMwQCSfGa7d4dCT.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@eilagwen\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/65137/thread\" timestamp=\"1493774950\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-0\" title=\"eilagwen\"><img alt=\"eilagwen Avatar\" src=\"//storage.proboards.com/6046952/images/uCQvKjMwQCSfGa7d4dCT.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/65137/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1493774950000\" title=\"May 2, 2017 17:29:10 GMT -8\">May 2, 2017 17:29:10 GMT -8</abbr></a>  @eilagwen said:</div>She bit into her apple and felt the gaze of someone on her.

Eilagwen could only stare as four more heads whipped around to look at her with a scary focus, and then zipped on over to where she was sitting on her own bench, asking about her ears.<br/><br/>She was stone-faced throughout the duration of this, one bite taken from her candy apple. The questions seemed never ending, and when it finally seemed as if she might break through, she spoke. \"Yes,\" was all she said to them. She had absolutely no interactions with children from her history to bank on. <br/><br/>Part of her hoped that if she played dead -- er, boring -- the children would get bored and go away. Back to their father, presumably.
