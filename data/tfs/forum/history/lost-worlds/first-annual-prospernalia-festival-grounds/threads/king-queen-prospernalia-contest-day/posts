A coveted and bragging-rights position, the King and Queen will be celebrated all through out the festival, given VIP seating to all of the contest (unless they'd like to participate in further contests!) as well asbeing winners of beautiful, ornate, and gorgeous crowns worth a small fortune, 100 gold coins each, and acustom-created outfit created by the fashionable modiste and enchantress, Lady Genevieve St. James               .\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  A shameless popularity contest, the King and Queen are usual chosen by who is the most beautiful or charismatic, although there has been a surprise a time or two! A casual but fun affair, those who wish to participate simply come upon when the time is called by Ganymede Galaii           ; men on the dais when it is time to crown the King of Prospernalia and women on the dais when it is time to crown the Queen of Prospernalia. Ganymede will then present each man or woman, and the crowds who have come to see the fun cheer (or crickets!) for those they think they should win.Those with the loudest cheers win the crown, the gold, and the enchanted custom-made garments!_____________________________________________________________Applying a Character to the Contest1.)

Looking upon the golden orb, she marveled at its radiance, the vampire had not known her greatest enemy was so beautiful. On this day, the vampiress forged an alliance with her nemesis to help showcase her beauty in natural light.People who knew her as a waitress from the Midnight Sun would see her as a different person; not a bunny girl, but an aspiring queen. Even her hair was different, grown out longer and styled for the contest, but still recognizable by her signature crimson streak. Her hair now looked a little more wavy and the back of her hair was tied into a curly ponytail that lay over her shoulder. Her flawless alabaster skin could almost glisten in the sun\u2019s light.

Her fans and admirers cheered and whistled in support.While waiting she searched the crowd with her ruby eyes for people she knew, Silas Algeron in particular, she hoped he was watching her. If her mother wasn't around it was understandable, she was a busy woman running the city, but there she was! Skarlet spotted Empress Naoki and waved to her.

Some of the other ladies on stage were very pretty, but she remembered that's not all there is to the contest, Skarlet knows a lot of people and her fans would surely be loyal to her and help her win!

He was hungry for something big, something with some gravity to it. He wanted to stuff his mouth absolutely full of the sweet and wonderful chocolate, and indulge until his stomach was heavy and achey from his gluttonous treat.Badger had just purchased a rather large bar of pure, solid chocolatey goodness (easily enough to satisfy two or even three beings his size) as Ganymede's words reached him.\"King and Queen of Prospernalia!\" he exclaimed in surprise, mouth of course crammed full of chocolate. \"I'm missing it!\"Badger held his large chocolate prize above his head in both hands as he darted for the dais, his little legs moving in a blur under him as he went; left behind in his wake was only the waxy parchment the chocolate was wrapped in. He arrived at the stage, a ball of delightfully sweet and smooth cocoa confection chipmunked in his cheek, and nothing but his bare hands to hold the bar in. The gnome swallowed hard as he stepped out onto the stage, a big toothy smile (which contained a bare minimum of chocolate) plastered across his face that extended up to his eyes. He smiled and held the large bar up in one hand as he waved to the crowd with the other, both hands already covered in melted chocolate, and the bar already with a sizable bite out of it.\"My name is Badger, Ms. Galaii, and I would like to enter the contest for King of Prospernalia!\" he announced himself in his normal animated and boisterous manner.The sticky, 3'4 gnome stood on stage absolutely beaming.

The crowds yelled and cheered at the motley crew that was on stage, and Ganymede\u00a0turned to them, resplendent in her pink-and-gold, utterly outrageous as much as she was eye-dazzling.\"Alright, now -- those who will be King, to the left. Those who will be Queen, to the right,\" Ganymede said, gesturing to those who were on stage. Once they had lined up, Ganymede gestured to the right and the left, and then moved over to the left. \"Oooh, such lovely, lovely, morsels...\" She said, much to the laughter of the crowd as she winked at the men gathered. In particular, she showed favoritism to Badger   , sliding a fingertip down his cheek where chocolate had gathered and licking it off. \"Delicious,\" she said to the crowd and gave a small wiggle.\"Alright! Ladies and gentlemen, help me choose your King of Prospernalia!\" She moved down to the very end...KING OF PROSPERNALIAAlden Marshal   -- Wearing a floral crown around his dark hair, a respectable white linen tunic and dark breeches on his lean body, this man is a Sun Marshal, and seems a little hesitant on stage, his six children bouncing in the crowd. Anyone who has been in Isra would recognize him for his work with the Sun Marshals, and might enjoy seeing an official on stage.Raoul Ferdinand   -- Wearing a loose, and slightly-opened blue shirt to show off his muscular chest, tight trousers and boots with spurs still on them has a sort of dashing and debonair appeal to him, a five o'clock shadow on his lantern jaw, and a careless turn to his dark hair. He's a stranger, but a handsome one.Typhus \u00a0-- Wearing a loose grey shirt similar to Raoul's, this man is young, and lean, and raw, with an almost animalistic allure to his tawny eyes and messy white hair. It seems, however, that he only has eyes for a dark-haired beauty also standing on the stage, and is making no effort to appeal to the crowd.Badger \u00a0-- A little gnome on stage, sticky with chocolate, but with a jovial face, he is obviously Ganymede's favorite, and it's clear to see that even if he doesn't win this contest, he'll definitely win something. He is adorable, and very charismatic, and is a recent but fun-loving face in Isra.Kaine Aislinn \u00a0-- A young man with much enthusiasm, he's handsome in a boy-next-door sort of way, and is practiced with magic. Before everyone's eyes, he lights up the area with his colorful necklace and the magic therein, even flattering Ganymede with an image of herself. It earns him a wink. He's a smooth charmer.Silas -- This young man rushed the stage at the very end, and like Typhus, seems to have eyes for a scarlet-streaked someone. He makes a handsome and dashing figure in his clothes of gold and ivory, as if he is already fit to be king! It may make the choice easier for the crowd, given he already looks the part.... and Ganymede moved over each of the men gathered there, presenting them and listened to the crowd as they screamed and cheered. When she thought she heard enough, she nodded her head, and her hips swayed (mm, mm, mm, the material of her suit really hugged her ass...ets...) as she moved over to the ladies\u00a0that had come upon the stage.\"My darlings,\" she said, loud enough for the crowd to hear, and Ganymede's smile sparkled\u00a0at them all. \"Shall we choose the Queen of Prospernalia?\" She asked the crowd, and moved to the very end in order to present them all.QUEEN OF PROSPERNALIAAnnabelle \"Bella\" Khorudan \u00a0-- A very\u00a0comely dwarf, with round curves barely held in by a pretty green dress -- a dress enchanted to flirt and play and have fun. Ganymede seems taken with her, especially as the dwarf twirls and spins, her short skirt showing off her curvy calves and thighs. Delicious. A recent business owner in Isra, she is recognizable.@banditkelly  \u00a0-- A friend of the dwarf's, it seems this girl is rough and tumble, but there's definitely an attractive quality to that as well. She seems to be a little confused on how the proceedings go, which charms Gany and has the nymph kissing her on the cheek and gifting Kelly with a bit of a pinch.Lamina Manira \u00a0-- A well-known face in Isra, this young woman seems like a rabbit caught in the headlights. A recent addition to the Sun Marshal, everyone knows Lamina for her prowess in the Arena. It would be amusing to see the young girl as the Queen of Flowers, given her ability with the sword!@seren  \u00a0-- An unknown face, this girl seems obviously magical. Young, her hair sparkles with the night time, and the pretty purple dress she's in accents her well. She doesn't seem to speak much, but she seems to enjoy being on the stage, blushing and waving to the crowd.. and unaware that Typhus keeps looking her way.Elizabeth Finch \u00a0-- Another well-known face of Isra, this woman was the former commander of the Dawn Riders, and her transformation from commander to beauty is all but complete. In a gown of greens and blues and yellows, she still somehow looks forced onto the stage, much to the amusement of the crowd who recognizes her.Skarlet \u00a0-- Yet another face known about the Midnight Sun, this young woman usually works as a waitress showing off her curves, and even though her clothes are a TOUCH more modest this time around, everyone can see how pretty she truly is. She smiles and calls to her Midnight Sun friends, glancing Silas' way._____________________________________________________________________________________ONLY VOTE or \"LIKE\" POSTS ABOVE THIS ONE.

Then, without further ado, Ganymede turned to Liz, and she kissed her, in a hot and thorough kiss in front of the crowd, the taste of ambrosia\u00a0and mystery\u00a0on the nymph's lips as they met Liz's own. \"A kiss of luck,\" Ganymede told her when she lifted her silken lips, and Liz would be able to feel\u00a0the nymph's magic pulse through the ex-commander's body, as if joy would not be denied, and seeking diversion and pleasure would be all that Liz needed.Ganymede turned those dark and smirking eyes onto Raoul, crooked her finger, and then she was wrapped around him, too, kissing him as thoroughly and passionately as she had kissed Liz, giving him the gift that she'd also given the queen. She peeled herself away from Raoul amidst the laughter of the crowd, then clapped her hands.Servants came forward with a chest of gold for each, while Ganymede turned and took the gold-and-diamond wrought crown for the Queen of Prospernalia and put it with aplomb on Liz's head, then turned and put the king's crown upon Raoul's own. She presented gold-embossed certificates to St. James Clothery\u00a0to each, congratulated them again, and then bade them sit upon their thrones.After blowing a kiss to each, Ganymede then flounced away as the crowds came crushing in to congratulate and offer drinks and food and arm pats and handshakes, batting lashes for Raoul and sly winks for Liz, for who wouldn't also\u00a0want to kiss the King and Queen of Prospernalia?________________________________________The Contest is officially over!
