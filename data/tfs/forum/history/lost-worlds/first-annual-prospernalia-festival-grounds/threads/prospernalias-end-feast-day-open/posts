It is certainly a night of magic, no doubt aided along by the Muse of Merry-Making\u00a0as she welcomes guests.Imagine, if you will, multiple tables, with the boughs of the trees larges to ensconce\u00a0all of the tables, and even a centre for dancing in the middle. The tables are decorated with a burst of flowers in honor of Prospernalia.The Feast is generally for those who are the high mucky-mucks, but if one has the appropriate attire\u00a0and attitude, no doubt they would be welcomed. Romance\u00a0is in the air here, along with merriness\u00a0and joy, as the wine and ale flow, stories are told, toasts are made, and delicious food\u00a0is prepared and served.At the high table sits the ruler of the Free Cities and its territory, Empress Naoki, no doubt with her lover, Kate Green.The Ministers of Isra\u00a0were also invited to be in attendance, along with other important officials, each with one guest:Ryden Greyiron, the Chancellor of Isra, as well as the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Immigration.Minister Deathforge, the Minister of Judiciary.Robert Fletcher, the Minister of Trade.and of no surprise, Ganymede Galaii, the Minister of Arts and the genius behind the Prospernalia.Valerian Kastimeer, High Admiral of the Isran Navy,Lord Tristian Seryl, the Head of the Black Tower,Alden Marshal, the Head Marshal of the Sun Marshals.Also invited to be seated\u00a0at the high table\u00a0are the rulers of the lands beneath Isra's gracious umbrella, each with one guest as well:@fairuz,Enlidil, of the Norkari MountainsCountess Camilla Blake, of the recent MeridianLord Crovan of House Winter, ruler of the Winterlandsand Archlord Astaroth of the Steelscape.And, of course, in a position of prominence and highlighted, are the King and Queen of Prospernalia,\u00a0each with one guest:Elizabeth Finch, also former-commander of the Dawn Riders and once known as Commodoreand Raoul Ferdinand, a man who has quickly made himself the Sweetheart of Isra.No doubt, there are other members of prominence\u00a0that are at the feast, and perhaps, even those that should\u00a0have been seated at the table have made their regrets known to put empty chairs at the high table.\u00a0Although no musicians can be seen, there is definitely music\u00a0to aide in the atmosphere, as well as the dancing that may take place. There is no schedule tonight, no list of things that have to happen -- only a celebration\u00a0of the new year, of a new spring, and of many blessings\u00a0and blossoms\u00a0to come.Eat! Drink! And be Merry!Ganymede\u00a0herself chose to wear a gown with a skirt of glittering gold, and what looked like real flowers\u00a0as her bodice. Indeed, if one were to touch them, they would find that they truly were real\u00a0flowers and petals, and only held to her bodice by.. what? Magic? Her hair was half swept up, curved and pinned with more flowers, a sweet perfume about her. It was by far one of her more whimsical looks, and although she dared\u00a0to be inappropriate, she had turned it down, it seemed, for this occasion.________________________________________________________________________________________Any characters may attend, as long as characters show up in their finest!Characters TAGGED may bring a guest, and characters TAGGED are under no obligation to actually post in.

He popped it open, drank probably one or two sips too many, then gave a slight groan of relief. Within seconds, he felt his mind clear itself of a voice that wouldn't stop talking.Yes, that's right.

Having very much enjoyed their previous engagements, he could not think of anyone better suited to join him, nor anyone not invited of their own merit more deserving of a place at the table - after all, she was a de facto member of the Isran upper echelon, or however you might choose to call it. For this socially-significant celebration, he broke away from his trend of dressing conservatively, in unadorned, monochrome tunics and trousers to wear his newest outfit, recently sourced from the St. James Clothery. It was a magnificent garment in midnight blue, accented with touches of black and a barely-lighter shade of navy. Replacing common buttons, the jacket was held together by small ropes of silver thread which kept it resting neatly over Ryden's form, attached to clasps made of silver and moonstone that ran down his front, creating a burst of light amidst the smooth, austere darkness the rest of the jacket gave off. The silvered thread and silver clasps flashed in the firelight, the moonlight, and the magelight marvellously.The jacket being the centrepiece of the outfit meant that the other pieces must be suitably conservative, and the trousers and undershirt fit that criteria, falling back into the familiar monochrome habits. That said, they still looked high-quality, for the very good reason that they were high-quality. As with all things from the St. James Clothery, though - this outfit had a special\u00a0enchantment, one specifically intended for Ryden. It was an enchantment of persuasion, and an enchantment of subordination. Those who stood in his vicinity would not only follow his orders, but feel comfortable and at ease doing so, convinced that what he said were words of wisdom, and those to live by. It would not, of course, create a mindless following, but it would certainly ease him into - and out of - any situations he might need particular obsequience or acquiescence in - not that he expected or desired that enchantment to come in demand that evening. Until such time as someone or something interesting were to occur, though, Ryden was content to sit back, sip on a Beaujolais-villages, and make casual conversation to those sitting around him, especially his invited company.", "link_list": ["/user/875"], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/VdszEVl.png"], "html": "Ryder Greyiron sat halfway along the right-hand side of the high table, beside "}, "post-65219": {"user": null, "user_num": null, "timestamp": "1493822828000", "message": "She watched him, Knight-Captain Calgary, and saw the shift in him from flirtatious rake to almost a commander and it made her opinion of him raise a bit from where it had dropped before.

She was beginning to suspect that he wasn't just interested in her company for business, and the thought alone made her heart skip a beat and put butterflies in her stomach like she was a girl of sixteen again. Quite simply, the enchantress did not receive\u00a0attention like this, or if she did, it was done so subtly that the Gauldish noblewoman never picked up on it.\u00a0Well, save for Rhean (Hope \"Not an Assassin\"), who had been very ardent. But she'd found him to be somewhat spontaneous and easy to speak. That is to say, she didn't actually believe that any of what that man had said had been true.Ryden, however. He seemed so very... deliberate. In all things. So very sure of himself. A man of quiet countenance and will, and an innate sense of own's own self worth and self power that was attractive on all its own -- yet the Chancellor's good looks held an altogether different influence over the golden-haired seamstress.In any case, her bedroom at her estate, Deuxcouers Hall, was covered in clothing as she tried to figure out what to wear. What statement to make? How should she appear? Ballgowns? No. They were meeting in a field for a festival, this wasn't a ballgown\u00a0moment. How casual was this? Was Ryden making a statement by being seen with her? No, perhaps not. Perhaps?She finally decided to settle on something that was comfortable to her, yet... young. For her, anyway. Perhaps it was bold. No, it was undoubtedly bold (again, for her), but she theorized that it wouldn't hurt to show a little skin when no doubt so many others would be as well.She settled on a gown of silver, a shade to match the threading she used on Ryden's coat. It was made all of one material, monochromatic, and had a very high neckline. It was snug to her frame, outlined the curves of her breasts, the gracefulness of her arms, the tinyness of her waist, the flare of her hips, and dropped down to the ground. It even had a small train. Indeed, to look at her, there was absolutely no skin showing but her hands and her face -- for her golden hair was once again swept up (and has never before been seen down).It was when she turned... oh. Oh, when she turned, the beauty of her back could be seen, the slender line of her spine, the quiet, toned musculature of her back, the graceful lines of her shoulder-blades were visible, all the way up to the back of her neck, that place where she was sensitive -- where a kiss might make her shiver.\u00a0\u00a0It was a simple but divine gown, and the silver of it made her blue eyes even more sapphire on her face. Quiet, unobtrusive diamond studs were at her ears, needing no more jewelry given the subtly shimmering hue of her gown, and when she walked into the Prospernalia End's Feast with Ryden, she tried to keep herself calm.She took a seat beside Ryden, and she smiled at Lady Cassandra Winter to see her there, sharing a few kind words with her. She also noticed that Annabelle \"Bella\" Khorudan and @banditkelly were also there, each in their own enchanted gowns, and that made Genevieve smile as well. She gave a small wave to Raoul Ferdinand and Elizabeth Finch, if they were to look her way, and reminded herself to check in with them tonight. Another nod to Empress Naoki and Kate Green, although it was a little more difficult for Genevieve to look at them. The last time she'd been in their company, Odette had still been alive.But mostly, her attention was on Ryden. She spoke with him, laughed quietly with him, listened to him. Her quiet grace seemed to strongly compliment his quiet power -- or perhaps that was his enchanted clothing work its charm on her.\u00a0They were sitting and speaking, and the music was playing, and the magic was heavy in the air. The lights glittered and gleamed over them all, the flowers blossomed with their sweet perfume, and once Genevieve had finished taking a sip of her wine, she turned to Ryden, her blue eyes on his.\"Ryden,\" she said to him, \"Will you dance with me?\"", "link_list": ["/user/1458", "/user/2230", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/2173/deuxcoeurs-plantation-hall", "/user/1685", "/user/2207", "/user/2168", "/user/1337", "/user/607", "/user/567"], "image_list": ["https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/36/ac/4b/36ac4b0c96002100ec61ee0ed1e5a022.jpg", "https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/ca/79/9c/ca799cc50be4194a735c749617a973b4.jpg"], "html": "Genevieve had fretted over what she would wear for days once "}, "post-65223": {"user": null, "user_num": null, "timestamp": "1493828362000", "message": "\"I will see you in the morning.

He turned his back to Ganymede and moved back over to his earlier seat, which had once again been taken by another who sat chatting and eating the same as those around them. \"Move,\"\u00a0he ordered, a cold rigidness in his voice that went far beyond his earlier order. Whereas before there had only been a feeling of anxiety in he who took Kelmaer's place at the table, there was now a veritable feeling of terror that followed him like a poison fog. Invisible to all, yet creeping into the hearts and the minds of those closest; causing hair to rise on skin, chills to creep down spines, bladders to threaten to weaken and uncontrollable panic to grow.The individual quickly got out of the seat, while those sat closest seemed stunned into a silence. Kelmear took his place again, then found his own self being shackled and pulled down into the dirt even though no such physical act was taking place; like a quicksand of the mind that disassociated him from the entire feast until he could swear he was alone, sitting in a dark room and sulking with golden eyes that grew darker towards black.His fingers slowly found their way to his satchel of potions again and brought a light red vial out of it. He unscrewed the lid, took the lips of the glass to his own and then drank from it until a little spilled down his chin. Then he turned the lid shut, placed the potion back besides the others and closed the satchel lid with a click.Slowly it all came back to him, his rational state of mind, his position in his seat, the feast going on around him, the sky above and the food that smelled so delicious on the table.

Afterward, she nods thoughtfully, as one does after hearing such a story. Turning to glance in the direction Bella indicates and sees Genevieve and Ryden dancing. The sight prompts a slightly raised eyebrow and a half-smirk from Naoki; it isn\u2019t a sight she thought she would ever see.When Naoki had first met Ryden, he had struck her as a hard sort of man. (Not speaking with any euphemism in that instance.) It seemed to her as if he had come from somewhere far away, following some terrible event that forced him to leave his previous home. Those sorts of people, Naoki has found, when not shattered, are often rigid, and such seemed to be the case with him. Either that or he was simply that sort of individual, Naoki cannot say. But it had seemed to her as if Ryden would not go out of his way to share any compassion he may or may not have with others, so it is mildly surprising to her to find him attending the feast and dancing with Genevieve. It seems out of character for him, but Naoki thinks such activities to be quite healthy. She doubts she would be able to function as The High Lady without the support provided by Kate, and though Naoki does not share a close personal relationship with Ryden, and though dancing with a woman once isn't particularly significant, she\u2019s pleased that he seems to be lightening up, at least.Similarly, though she has yet to speak personally with her since the event, Naoki is acutely aware that Genevieve's child, Odette, has passed away, leaving her not only a widow but now a childless widow. Though Naoki does have Skarlet , she cannot begin to guess at how deeply that loss must have affected Genevieve and has a great deal of unexpressed sympathy. Yet, there she is over there, dancing with Ryden. Though she is aware it is highly presumptuous to do so, Naoki assumes that they are both enjoying themselves at least to some extent, and is happy for the pair of them. It's good that they\u2019ve been able to find some solace in each other or something like that.In any case, Naoki discontinues considering such matters as a far more attractive subject approaches, @fairuz   . Once again exercising her Right to Ogle, Naoki looks up to calmly meet the Emira\u2019s eyes before looking down to appreciate the craftsmanship of her gown, ostensibly. Though Naoki is only subtle up to an extent. For the space of a few moments as Fairuz seats herself, Naoki speculates, among other far less decent things, about what passes for formal dress in Sakand, if Faruiz might be perhaps a bit chilly in this night air, and how Ryden behaved during his talks with her.\u201cIt certainly is,\u201d Naoki responds, offering her greeting in the form of a courteous nod. \u201cMore so,\u201d she continues, \u201cnow that it seems I have the unexpected pleasure of meeting you personally.\u201d", "link_list": ["/user/2207", "/user/257"], "image_list": [], "html": "Tearing another piece off her roll, Lady Naoki chews as she listens to "}, "post-66013": {"user": "Elizabeth Finch", "user_num": 1337, "timestamp": "1494328671000", "message": "May 8, 2017 18:29:55 GMT -8 Raoul Ferdinand said:\u201cIf-\u201d Raoul cut himself off when the apple flew towards his head.

As he considered, he realised he had done so before. It was an interesting question. Why?\"Oh, but Genevieve - there are a thousand and one things I could say, and they are all true - and, yes, I could get that from more than one woman. I could say that she was stunningly gorgeous; she was extremely skilled; she was elegant and eloquent, as reserved and upper-class as a lady should be; she was wickedly smart, and humorous to boot, and I could find more women than you who fit those criterion - however, you do so and in a far superior way. But that is not why I dance with you now, or at least, not entirely - there is more to this story.\"\"To be entirely truthful, I do not know. Your age is not far from mine - indeed, if anyone was middle-aged, it would be me, and I do not profess to know why you are with someone well beyond your age, as I am - and you are no recluse. After all, are you not here with me?\"\"That well and said, though, I see within you a melancholy that I understand, that I empathise with, and that is a rare and wondrous thing - but that too is not all, nor should it be. There is something about your personality, the very way that you are that I feel drawn to in a way that is so natural and yet defies definition or explanation; as a moth is to a candle, so too I am to you, and I have danced around for too long, wanting to get closer but waiting, for the fear of being burnt. I instead wonder why you are letting this dusty, ancient moth hover around your flame, when doubtless, you would rather have butterflies.\"He smiled again, with a light sort of chuckle at his accidental and overt, albeit entirely warranted, poetic outburst. The way he said it, though - it was so clear, so obvious. He said it as if it were self-evident and unquestionable - and for him, in a way, it was, for he did not understand why he was doing what he was doing, only that it felt right.", "link_list": ["/user/875"], "image_list": [], "html": "Ryden smiled a strange sort of smile, all at once pleased and intrigued and confused and satisfied, as he looked out over "}, "post-66111": {"user": "Lady Genevieve St. James", "user_num": 875, "timestamp": "1494430216000", "message": "They continued to sway and move together on that dance floor, finding a perfect step, a perfect rhythm that tied her body to his.  Vaguely, Genevieve could hear the sounds of conversation and laughter, the drifting melody that they stepped to, but it all seemed very far away and she was so very focused on the man just inches away from her, looking down at her with those deep, dark blue eyes, speaking with a quiet and elegant timbre on his voice (that alone might have caused a little shiver down her naked spine) that made her feel as if she were the only important person worth his time in this moment.Too late, she felt as if she had opened a proverbial can of worms by asking him why. Why? Why had she even asked that? It hadn't been appropriate, really. She should have just been thankful for the opportunity he gave her and gracefully appreciated what time he chose to spend and not think about who else or why else or what else there could be in-- in-- in whatever this was growing between them.She wasn't looking for anything more. She didn't actually deserve anything more. She'd had her chance at love, and she'd ruined that. She'd had many chances, at many opportunities, that others simply didn't get and she'd wrecked every last one. The Universe would be entirely unfair to keep sending blessings her direction, and she'd be entirely selfish to keep taking them.Yet, here was another opportunity presented to her, as the tall and distinguished and... genuinely compassionate Chancellor of Isra pinned her with his direct gaze and spoke to her like a poet and scholar combined. He spoke to her and described her and detailed his pull to her, not just like a master scholar might describe a masterpiece with a deep respect for the trade, but as if he was also drawn in by the romance and appeal of the masterpiece. An answer that involved both heart AND head, a lethal combination to the chains Genevieve had put upon herself.She shouldn't have asked. She absolutely did not deserve this opportunity, or this man.That knowledge, above all else, rang astoundingly true in her mind -- a clear toll. She took a breath, her heart pumping fast beneath her breath, and knew that she would have to end this before it went any further. She could endure his disappointment now, but later on down the road, when she'd given more of herself to him and he to her and she inevitably ruined or destroyed or... killed him... well. She just wasn't that strong.\"Ryden Greyiron,\" she said quietly, and her hand lifted from his shoulder to slide her fingertips gently through the silvered hair at his temple, curling it gently around his ear in an intimate touch. Her face was tilted up to his, given how tall he was, her light blue eyes trailing over his face, her lashes long and casting gentle shadows over her elegant cheekbones. The low, glittering lights above them helped to dance over her features, calling attention to the curve of her mouth, the line of her feminine jaw, that teasing beauty mark high on her cheek beneath the gaze that was now both equal parts warm and sad. \"You are not a moth, nor dusty, nor too old for any opportunity. You are a good man, straight through to your soul,\" she spoke, her accent a touch heavier on her words as she felt emotions clawing up her throat. \"I am so grateful for the time we have spent together, but we cannot be more than tonight. Please, do not want me. I-- There is too much you do not know and too much that I...\" Her words trailed off and she tilted her head down, closing her eyes for a moment. She laughed gently, a humorous sound, and then looked back up at him. \"I think I have ruined the romance of this evening,\" she joked lightly, trying to pull things back to where it was easy and comfortable.She wasn't ready for things to become heavier, although, in truth, she never would be. She'd never allow herself to be. The only way she'd ever reveal the total darkness that she dealt with -- that woke her up in the early hours of the morning and found herself lying awake, staring at the ceiling, wondering if it was worth it to leave her bed or not -- is if she was pulled and yanked, kicking and screaming, to come face to face with it.She was a wicked and damned creature, as someone had once said to her, urging her to take his sword and end her life. She deserved purgatory and hell, and nothing less, given what she had done to her husband and her daughter. She didn't deserve happiness, as someone had once reminded her. She didn't deserve to feel happiness or joy, and no amount of pretty dresses and romantic dances and good men would ever, ever change that.She shouldn't have come tonight. She shouldn't have asked Ryden why.It was only a few seconds between her humorless laugh and an attempt at a joke before the expression on her face changed to one of guilt and melancholy and she stopped dancing, throwing the easy rhythm between herself and Ryden completely off. \"I am so sorry, Ryden,\" she rushed out, her voice soft and breathless. She felt the panic rising in her chest at what she had done, and pulled herself out of his embrace.She glanced around her, embarrassed if anyone was looking their direction. She didn't want to cause a scene, and her eyes snapped back to Ryden's face. \"Please, don't,\" she said to him simply, and turned to leave him on the dance floor, and, indeed, leave him at the Feast, a vision of smooth skin and silver rushing away.", "link_list": ["/user/1458"], "image_list": [], "html": "They continued to sway and move together on that dance floor, finding a perfect step, a perfect rhythm that tied her body to his.
