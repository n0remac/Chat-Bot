Ganymede Galaii          will \u201copen\u201d the contest with an opening post in this thread. Follow Ganymede so you won\u2019t miss it! 2.) You will have 24 Hours to make an IC-post of your character arriving at the jousting stadium and submitting themselves to the contest with a regular horse, regular armor and a regular lance! (No NPC accounts, only characters that would logically be in Isra allowed)3.) After 24 hours, Ganymede will close applications by making a post where Ganymede will announce the contest participants, in-character, as well as the brackets on who will be facing who. She will tag all accepted characters, and delete posts of disqualified characters!Then, the jousting will begin! 1 vs 1 bracket style. 3 rounds = 1 joust. Best 2 out of 3 rounds win the Joust. Highest roll on the die wins the round. The die determines who wins, but the players decide how or why their characters lost (i.e. your character does not have to have a humiliating loss because you rolled a 1, the 1 only indicates that you rolled a smaller number than your opponent).4.) ROUND ONE! If accepted, you will have 24 hours to make an in-character post of riding down your lane, lance lowered at your opponent. It does not matter who posts first. Tag your opponent, and end your post by rolling 1d20 (do not go back and edit your post). 5.) After 24 hours, Ganymede will end the First Round, list the winners from each round, and signal the beginning of the next round. Characters who did not post within 24 hours will get an automatic 0 to their score for that round, but may post into other rounds. Ganymede will post an OOC Scoreboard so players can keep track.6.) ROUND TWO! Same as Round One.7.) After 24 hours, Ganymede will end the round, etc. Ganymede will also note if certain players have already won Best 2 of 3, and those players will need not post to round three.8.) ROUND THREE! Same as Round One and Two.9.) After 24 hours, Ganymede will end the Final Round, and will announce the winners of the First Joust. Losers will be thanked and waved out, and winners will be re-organized into new brackets, and the jousting process will begin again until we have our winners.IRL Time Line: Gany opens contest > 24 hours for characters to apply > Gany begins the First Joust with Round 1 > 24 hours for characters to post to Round 1 > Gany posts results, begins Round 2 > 24 hours for characters to post to Round 2 > Gany posts results, begins Round 3 > 24 hours for characters to post to Round 3 > Gany closes First Joust, and moves on to Second Joust with Round 1...
