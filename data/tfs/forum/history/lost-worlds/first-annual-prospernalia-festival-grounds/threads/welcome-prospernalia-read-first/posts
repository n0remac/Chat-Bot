All posts, save for the ones by Ganymede, should be made in-character! Yes, there is an OOC explanation at the end of every Contest post (and this one!), but it is meant to explain the idea to you, the player! If you have specific questions about the set up or the festival, please message Ganymede directly!2.) Although dice-rolling is present in the contests, it is not indicative of how terribly a person did. That is to say, rolling a 1 is not an auto-fail, it just means that you\u2019ve rolled the lowest possible number, and it\u2019s highly likely that you\u2019ll have lost. It\u2019s up to you, the player, to determine why your character might have failed, and by what margin. And yes, the dice-rolling is mandatory and cannot be skipped or changed.3.) All contests will open on the same IRL day, but IC, the contests will have opened on the day in their title. If I opened each contest after the last one ended, we\u2019d be roleplaying this festival for weeks! Instead, I will include what \u201cday\u201d of the festival it is that the contests begin. i.e. The Archery Contest \u2013 Day 2. This means to you, the player, that the festival had already begun yesterday, and the people are now enjoying their second day into the Prospernalia.4.) The Prospernalia on this scale is rather \u2018new\u2019 but the tradition is not. Isra is new-ish city. It\u2019s only been around for less than a decade. The tradition of celebrating the new year during spring is not a new one, however, and many of the traditions at Prospernalia are old customs. It is the first year that Ganymede has been the Minister, however, so a festival at this scale is a first-time thing.5.) Please, please, please follow Ganymede, and follow the Announcements board so that you can be kept up-to-date with who has won what! And if you are making a post that might effect something or should draw attention or importance, please feel free to tag Ganymede in the post!6.) This is Isra. There are guards and safety everywhere, even if you can\u2019t see them.
