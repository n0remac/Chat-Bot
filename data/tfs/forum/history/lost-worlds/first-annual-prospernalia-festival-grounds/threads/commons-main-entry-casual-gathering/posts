He had no interest in the games, though, and was not yet hungry - rather, he was more interested in wandering around and talking to the various festivalgoers about whatever they might want to discuss. It was a rarity for him to be able to interact with the Isran public and talk over things with them, however banal or, conversely, important they as be. The guards accompanying him stayed a satisfactory distance back as to both be clandestine and also unobtrusive.

Though Naoki is far from an authority on fashion, she does have her tastes, and whatever sort of garment that is, with its deep V-neck and gold ornamentation, receives Naoki's approval. Though perhaps, Naoki supposes, she's more attracted to the woman within, and the garment is simply an excellent framing.

As they pull apart, Naoki comes away with a lopsided smirk. She gives Ganymede a quick squeeze before withdrawing her hand and runs the tip of her tongue across her upper lip. As Alli approaches and seats herself, Naoki turns halfway to offer her a smile and a nod, in an excellent mood of her own, but Ganymede has captured Naoki's full attention for the time being, so she turns back to respond to the question.

Eli was so out of place wearing her new set of clothes, leather boots, and dress which was more for hunting however it still looked impressive as it clung to her hourglass frame. Her red hair was loose around her shoulder and she\u00a0put on the smallest amount of makeup to blend in and to bring out her eyes and of course, she wore her two power-stones around her neck hidden in their\u00a0little pendants but if someone looked really close they would see a faint glow. Eli had spoken to as few people as possible and was mostly set to win a few games and hopefully sell the prize later to earn a few extra coin, she had traded most of her things when she arrived which made her an apparent small fortune and enough to put her up in a local inn with food for a couple of weeks but she hoped to find a line of work her skill set was suited, so far, however, she found nothing.\u00a0She found a bench shaded by a bright multi-colored umbrella and sat down. 'Umbrella' she thought to herself again a word which completely\u00a0fascinated her. When she first found out its name couldn't stop saying it, the man who told her of such a fascinating fact had looked at her as if she was crazy, maybe she was.
