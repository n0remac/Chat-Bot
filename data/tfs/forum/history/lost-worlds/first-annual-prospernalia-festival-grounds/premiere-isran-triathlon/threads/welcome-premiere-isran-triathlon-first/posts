In it, competitors are invited from across the world to participate in the events being held. There are several small competitions and sideshows to be held in the downtime between the three primary events.Day OneOpening CeremonyDay TwoThe Archery CompetitionDay ThreeThe Chariot RaceDay FourThe Discus ThrowDay FiveAwards CeremonyOOC Information:Characters spectating events may post in the relevant event thread. Threads tagged (Casual Gathering) are unsupervised, and intended to be used throughout the Triathlon for whatever miscellaneous roleplay might occur outside the scope of the events.Completing the events will take longer than the five days of the Triathlon in-character. The Awards Ceremony will be held promptly after the last event is completed.The competitions are all dice games. Follow the instructions given in each thread to participate. Although dice-rolling is present in the contests, it is not indicative of how terribly a person did. That is to say, rolling a 1 is not an auto-fail, it just means that you\u2019ve rolled the lowest possible number, and it\u2019s highly likely that you\u2019ll have lost. It\u2019s up to you, the player, to determine why your character might have failed, and by what margin. The dice-rolling is mandatory and cannot be skipped or changed.Rules for Competitors:\u00a01. Posts in the competition may not be edited after being posted, at all.2. Players may not delete and re-post in the competition.3. Participating characters may not delete posts anywhere for the duration of the competition.4. Players may only have one character in a given competition.5. Only characters who have registered beforehand and are announced at the competition's beginning may participate.(It is possible to cheat, but I know how to tell if it's being done, and I'll be looking. Don't, or you'll be disqualified from all events.)Expect this post to be updated with links and additional information, and expect announcement posts in this thread.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/YX53IQT.png"], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><img alt=\"The Premiere Isran Triathlon\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/YX53IQT.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/></div>"}}
