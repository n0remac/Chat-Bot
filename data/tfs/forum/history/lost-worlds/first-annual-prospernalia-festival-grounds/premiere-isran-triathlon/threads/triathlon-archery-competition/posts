That wasn't promising. Maybe he had just gone to take a leak? With a sigh of resignation on the unlikeliness of that idea he turned to walk into the crowd. He had managed to find someone he could actually trust with which to leave his armor, and he hadn't had any weapons worth speaking of. Free of his trapping, however, Dirk was a solidly-built man with a head closely shaved to his skull to reduce discomfort when wearing his helm. His clothes were drab and threadbare, even slightly stained.  Well, maybe he'd make a name for himself here.
