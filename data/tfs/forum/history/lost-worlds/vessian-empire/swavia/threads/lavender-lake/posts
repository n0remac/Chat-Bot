They spread out in battle lines along the southern edge of the grassland, facing north.  Some scouts had spotted potential enemies and Heinrich thought it best to prepare for battle - just in case.  He finally saw his scout exit the forests ahead and race down the blue-purple fields to his location.There were only fifty Knight-Brothers with Heinrich, and only but only a dozen of them were true Brothers; the rest were squires and mounted men-at-arms.  Each one owned a barded warhorse capable of supporting their heavily armed rider.  Each rider was equipped with plate or mail armor, carried a heater shield, a lance, and a personal melee weapon.  Heinrich kept them behind the main force.Also in the army was a hundred Wickan Auxiliaries: men and women drawn from pacified settlements throughout Eastwick.  They were lightly armored, like their horses, and carried javelins, round wooden shields, and hand-axes.  They were quick, versatile, and acted as support or skirmishers.  All one-hundred of them were positioned on the right flank.Two-hundred crossbowmen from Vessia, who had been crusading, formed a line in the front ranks.  These were professional mercenaries who loved picking off their enemies from afar, and once battle commenced did not mind joining the fray with their swords.Behind the crossbowmen were five-hundred Order Sergeants: medium-armored warriors in service to the Brothers.  They wielded tower shields, mail armor, and halberds.  They were not particularly mobile, but could maintain formation and defend an area.\u00a0 They used the Lavender Lake to protect their left flank.Summary50 Knight Brothers (x2=100) - Heavily armored, elite, white-cloaked knights.\u00a0 Barded horses, lances, melee weapons, and shields.100 Wickan Auxiliaries (x2=200) - Light cavalry armed with throwing javelins and simple melee weapons, drawn from tribal levies in Eastwick and pushed into the service of the Order.200 Vessian Crossbowmen (x1=200) - Professional soldiers from Vessia armed with powerful Vessian-made crossbows and swords.500 Order Sergeants (x1=500) - Slow-moving, medium-armored melee units with tower shields and halberds.\u00a0 These are men drafted into service by the Order in the areas they control, properly equipped by the Knight Brothers.850 total combatants", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Heinrich sat atop his white horse as his soldiers continued to file out of the forest.
