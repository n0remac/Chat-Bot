These men waited for the horse patrols, stalking them like any other prey, a method new but necessary to the Vessians. They ended each one, and then made the signal to their comrades that all was clear. Without people to warn the villages they were little more the defenceless, the few Guards swiftly falling to bolts coming from so far they would barely have seen the shooters if they were looking directly at them.\u00a0The Soldiers went in and killed all indiscriminately. They did not leave one to even tell the tale. Most did not even know of the death coming to them, being split apart whilst dormant in their beds. The soldiers seemed to have more than just revenge in mind, they attacked the people even after they were dead leaving little more than a pile of bone meal, ichor, and innards in the centre of each settlement. In the few that had gates however, the corpses and such were rigged to tarps that would drop upon the entrance being opened, for great fear value upon those who came to see what happened. They did not touch the animals and such however, to make it from a distance sound and perhaps even appear as though all was relatively normal. They left shortly after, smug and covered in gore.\u00a0It was in the one furthest to the East that Gunther's father took him. The lad had turned fifteen recently and Lord die Kraftig thought it was the perfect time to teach his son the martial ways. Gunther did not mind fighting the Guards and Warriors about; they had chosen their path and received the death they wished for. But something was unnerving in the killing of the people, \u00a0about the slaughter of those who could not or did not fight back. When he went within he was horrified when he saw his butler, a man he saw as gentle and kind hook the leg of a running woman to get her to fall and then drive his axe into her head with a chuckle. He backed off, looking for some fresh air only to see his very father skewer a boy a few years younger than him upon his Lance. His father turned to him hearing the boy gasp. \"Come on son, don't be a coward, take their pathetic lives!\" He exclaimed, riding up to him. \"But father... these people, they're just ordinary working folk!\" Without hesitation has father responded. \"Have you not heard what they did to one of our villages?\" Gunther had heard, but he also knew that some were left alive. \"But father, they did not murder all of our kin so mercilessly, and surely we must be better than them?\" He pleaded. Lord Kraftig would have none of it and put his demand forth. \"Precisely. We are better, so we shall exterminate them. Now, that one struggling, right there him. End it.\" He said, pointing to a man crawling away with one of his legs gone. Gunther trembled a little, looking between him and his father. He could not stand under that glare, and faltered. He approached the person and carefully drove his sword into his heart, and stood back looking at what he did. His father nodded and rode off, barking orders.\u00a0The lad stood over the corpses, thinking over what he did and what was being done around him. He decided he could take no more and ran. He was encumbered, too preoccupied to even notice the weapons and armour still upon him. He could barely breath reaching a thicker grassland and then woods in but a few minutes. He eventually collapsed in a drift of snow, frightened at everything, and ready to accept his death of cold and exhaustion. He may still have been able to move, but at this point he did not want to and simply closed his eyes, waiting.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "It was a retaliation threefold, perhaps even more just as the Imperials promised.

Two of scouts were dragging an Imperial boy between them, his head hanging, his arms held in the meaty fists of the other two. They threw him down onto the ground that had hardened from bloody mood to packed dirt in the wintertime, although the smell of gore was wafting everywhere.\"I'll kill him now!\" yelled one of her man as he pulled out his axe.\"No,\" Efyria said, her grey eyes like iron as she looked at the young boy. He was perhaps aged similarly to her daughter, but even her daughter seemed more man than him. \"We need him alive. Warm him. Feed him. The boy lives.\"\"Efyri--\"\"-- We need to know how they found this place. How they got through. He's the only one alive,\" Efyria snapped, her voice as sharp as a blade's edge. Her gaze swept over the burly men and women that stood near her. \"Do as I say.\" She turned and looked and saw her son. \"Aun. Take him in hand.\"Aun stepped forward, his lip curling with disgust at Gunther. \"He deserves to be burned.\"\"Perhaps,\" Efyria said, looking down upon him as well. \"But not yet. Make camp. We burn and mourn the dead at morning, and then continue on.\" She turned, and the crowd parted as she moved to explore the rest of the village with her own eyes, looking for clues that the rest might have missed.
