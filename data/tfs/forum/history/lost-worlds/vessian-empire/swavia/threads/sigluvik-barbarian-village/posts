A fire burned in the great hearth at the center, and warrior men and even a few women sat upon the benches around. Tables were shoved up against the walls, where ornate and ethnic art and armor and items of respect where hung.And upon a throne made of ornately carved wood and bone, draped with furs, was Efyria herself, an iron crown around her head, and a scar over her eye rendering her imperfect. She was steel itself, and the noisiness of the room quieted as all of those hateful, ferocious stares descended upon Gunther.Aun shoved the boy to his knees in front of Efyria, whose own legs were bare from upper calf to lower thigh, old scars visible here and there upon her skin. Her son moved to take his place on her right-hand side, and Gunther would be able to see Efyria's daughter, fiercely beautiful and ornamented with a wolf skin, standing to Efyria's left.\"What is your name?\" Efyria asked in a tongue Gunther could understand, and her voice was as sharp as a blade, as cold as the winter frost.
