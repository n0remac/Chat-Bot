The Vongar looked at him, his grim and terrifying face studying the retinue.  \"Heavy armor; heavy weapons.  Some support.\"  The wretched and barbed gears inside of Dietrich's twisted mind started to turn, grind, and squeal as he devised a plan.  \"String the bows-\" he started to order quietly.One of the Vongar looked at him and said \"what?  Look at that armor - those weapons!  We're not outfitted for battle, sir-\"Dietrich looked over at the Vongar and grabbed him by the throat; his movement was surprisingly quick and quiet, like a snake.  \"Do as I say,\" he commanded, releasing his grip on the man and returning his hand to its original position.  \"String the bows.  One volley, one taunt.  After releasing, turn and run back to the horses.  Jump on and flee through the forest; we'll lose'em there.  If they follow, split up and meet back at the camp.\"The Vongar who spoke out of order might have been angry at his new boss, but he at least approved of the plan.  He nodded in agreement and strung an arrow, as did the other eight Vongar who were present - as soon as the Krastmen came into range.Nine Vongar arrows strung to nine Vongar bows, probably some of the best archers in Swavia.  They discreetly aimed at the 25 soldiers approaching the Wooden Fort and awaited Dietrich's command...  It was nothing new to the Sadist - to kill without thinking of consequence.........\"Loose!\"Nine arrows flew straight and true to their targets, with the intention to kill or or at least injure nine of the Krast soldiers.  Just before the arrows hit, the Vongar yelled out gibberish, which was suppose to sound like taunts.  The perception was important: Vongar arrows, Vongar archers, and Vongar insults: Barbarians!By the time the Krast soldiers would have known what was going on, the Vongar would have started to flee in the opposite direction, speeding back to the forest, hopping onto their horses and riding off as fast as possible.  The heavy Krast infantry would not be nearly as fast as the lightly-equipped Vongar, not to mention they'd have to scale the hill first; the arablests and bowmen would have no line of sight since the Vongar were on the complete other side of the hill and then disappear into the forest...", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Dietrich and the Vongar, all lightly armored and hiding in the brush upon the ridge, remained in a prone position and kept their presence hidden."}, "post-58303": {"user": "The Divine Empire of Vessia", "user_num": 1951, "timestamp": "1481681961000", "message": "The arrows flew upon the unsuspecting men, striking them just as Dietrich hoped.

He shoved it towards his ten allies. \"This is yours,\" he said bluntly. \"Take it.\"  The payment was quite hefty, and would make the tribe these men belonged to quite wealthy. The Vongar were allowed to leave, but Dietrich asked one man to stay behind, promising him even greater wealth. Later that night Dietrich started to equip his armor. The Vongar looked on at him but didn't ask why he was putting his equipment on, rather he just warmed his hands by the fire. \"Ready for the last request?\" Dietrich's gravel voice broke the silence.  He picked up his crossbow and loaded it with a bolt. The Vongar stood up and shrugged, \"sure.\"In a split second, the former OrdenMarschall pivoted and fired his crossbow at the Vongar's right thigh, striking it. He yelled out in pain and fell to the ground. Dietrich slowly walked over with rope; one end was looped. The Vongar tried desperately scrambling away but the Brother Knight was upon him. The great man picked his steel-clad foot and slammed it down on the Vongar's knee, shattering the bone. The poor man cried out in pain. The Sadist put the noose around the man's neck and tightened it until he could barely breath. He suffocated only slightly, until his senses were heightened. The Knight then bound the man's hands and feet together, and threw the remaining rope over a tree branch. The Vongar was raised up, suspended. \"I don't like tribals,\" Dietrich said calmly. He took some firewood and threw it beneath the Vongar. \"I don't like _you_.\"  He took a burning piece of wood and started a fire beneath the Vongar. \"You smell of shit and piss.\"  The fire burned higher and the Vongar struggled to free himself. \"I raped some of your women the last time I was here. Funny part is, I had just fought alongside their husbands.\"  Dietrich laughed and his voice was now barely understandable. \"They had no idea!\"  The fire burned higher and started to roast the bottom of the Vongar's feet...--<>--A tall, burly Knight of the Audrian Order rode towards the Krast Wooden Fort the next day. His dirty white cloak fluttered in the wind and the sun gleamed off of his helmet. On the back of his horse lay an unconscious Vongar warrior. When this Knight was received, he would tell the Krastmen:\"Caught this man and some of his boys trying to set up an ambush on the road. I overhead him speaking to his comrades about raiding the countryside in support of Queen Efyra. As a Knight of the Audrian Order, I took it upon myself to arrest this man when he was separated from the group. As this is the closest settlement, I figured I'd bring him in here.\"Dietrich pulled a parchment from his saddlebag. \"Here, this is the seal of the Adrian von Heschburg, your new Count.
