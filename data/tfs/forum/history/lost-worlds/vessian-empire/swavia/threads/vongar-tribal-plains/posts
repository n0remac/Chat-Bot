The goal here was to avoid going into the actual plains, avoiding the Vongar.  First he needed to hunt the local animals, anything with fur and bones.Using the fur, bones, and antlers of the animals he killed, Dietrich fashioned himself a suit of \"hunter's attire\": something that made him look like a tribal figure rather than some Vessian.  He dirtied his face and did not wash; he used the blood of a fresh kill to create two streaks of 'war paint' on the side of his stern, emotionless, yet frightening face.Now...Dietrich rode his freakish horse across the Vongar Tribal Plains.  He carried a crude longbow which he had fashioned himself, as well as a few daggers and knives.  The hides of various animals were strewn about on his horse.  A fur quiver of also-crude arrows jostled at his back.He hoped to run into a passing patrol of Vongar...", "link_list": ["/user/1951"], "image_list": [], "html": "((("}, "post-57559": {"user": "The Divine Empire of Vessia", "user_num": 1951, "timestamp": "1480990087000", "message": "Dietrich might catch a glimpse of occasional horsemen going around, getting a view of him with telescopes supplied by the Empire.
