Each camp has it's own master, who can do as he desires with those under control, often running it as a business with those within working mines or farms. When a source of slave labour is necessary, these are usually contacted. There are several classifications of those detained.1st, or lowly criminals: thiefs, rapists and adulterers living under lenient rulers or more serious prisoners who have mitigating circumstances, like having aided in the apprehension of their comrades in crime.2nd, enemies of one of the Vessian peoples or a noble: Subject to more specific treatments of their ethnic group or of their ruling noble, these prisoners usually have their own assigned supervisors to administer their often unique punishments.3rd, or enemies of the state and mankind: the worst of those who were not killed, these people are usually subject to various tortures on a daily basis or are worked to death. These include anything from Witches to non-humans.One must note that there is very little in the way of a greater Vessian law, and all is subject to personal scrutiny of various people within the Empire.
