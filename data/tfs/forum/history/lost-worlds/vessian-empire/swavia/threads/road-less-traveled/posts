She was cast through dense forests and forgotten alcoves before spanning across the northern seas.In the distance she could make out more fire and smoke.  Vessian settlers, colonists, and traders had been executed by strange warriors.  Children were bound and loaded onto covered wagons.  The vision shifted away, heading deeper into the mysterious forests of that northeastern province, until she came upon a valley, whereupon a vast army was assembled.  Strange chanting and war cries echoed in her head as barbaric horsemen whipped foreign slaves, who toiled away to their death.An image of a blonde-haired, blue-eyed beauty flashed before her before everything faded to black...-</\\>-Adrian groaned in pain as the knife fell from its wound and onto the ground, covered in blood.  And then, to his surprise, his wound started to heal.  Nearby, where the father and son lay dying, their wounds too were healed and their breathing returned to normal.  Adrian's head, wrought with pain by the man's mace, found itself devoid of all ailment.  Someone had cast a healing touch upon him; he had seen it done many times while on a crusade, where the injured were treated by priests, nuns, and monks.Helmut and the men of the Liedenkorp would observe a blonde-haired, blue-eyed beauty step from behind a nearby tree.  A white silk robe hung from her shoulders, and a black cross hung around her neck.  Whether the men were devoted Angelists or not, they'd recognize this woman's divine and pious nature.  She was an Angelist no doubt, but from a land far away.\"I come here with a warning,\" she said determinedly, eyes fixed on Helmut.  \"But I see this: a knight who takes no heed of his vows  - and a Witch-Hunter who does not deserve his title... and I wonder if your people are worth saving.\"  The woman sighed and looked down at Cerri and then at Adrian, whose strength was restored.  \"A powerful enemy grows in the east, and before long they will be upon you.  My own people suffer a fate worse than death, and I do not wish for the same to happen to you.  Now, more than ever, you need to stand together.  The Brotherhood is broken, without a leader.  They need you, Adrian von Heschburg.  Take them east and meet this devastation before it reaches your people.\"  She looked up at Helmut.  \"And you Witch-Hunter, you still have a part to play.  This man,\" she told him, referring to Adrian, \"is all that stands between you and annihilation.  You owe him clemency; the charges against the Lady are false, and you know this.  His heart is just, and his actions are just, but this path is not his destiny.  Take him back to your Emperor, baptize him in the name of the Lord, and set him on the right path.\"The mysterious lady motioned her hand to Cerri.  \"The Lady knows of the danger I speak of.  I suggest you listen to her.\"  She started to back away slowly before ultimately fading into obscurity.  \"Praise the Divine One, and make your choice... Witch-Hunter...\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "All sounds and sights around Adrian vanished, disappearing into oblivion.  His breathing was slow and methodical; tears welled in his eyes, but he made no movement.  Even when the man stabbed him in the gut he did not flinch, for he was broken; finished.  The mace hit him in the head and he was close to blacking out.  He could die here and it would not phase him.  He accepted his fate, his actions, and his consequences.  So focused was he on Cerri, knowing it'd be the last he'd see of her, that he did not even look up at Helmut."}, "post-63459": {"user": "Cerridwyn von Heschburg", "user_num": 1957, "timestamp": "1492734623000", "message": "She sat up with a frightened gasp after the nightmarish images branded themselves into her mind.

Children chained like Dogs, my lord... Are you so focused on killing us for something we never meant to do? Aye, Adrian fell in love with me, but he did offer for my hand out of need for an heir as much as lover. And my father... He would marry a witch and you would ignore that to hunt us....
