She road with capability, following after a man she wasn't sure she trusted, but may be the only thing that was going to take her from the dismal life she currently led. She reined in her horse and dismounted with grace, hitching her horse up as well.Her gaze narrowed when first, he ordered her around, and then began to tell her the lay of the land, and then proceeded to inform her on what he was doing with the moss. \"It's almost like you hired me to be a guide because of my lay of the land and my own talent and experience with these specific matters,\" she snapped at him, reminding him that she knew there was a marshland ahead -- she knew to stay down -- she knew what he was doing with the moss.She wasn't just SOME woman, she was Ylva god-damned Gerharde. She knew what was happening and why they were here. Still, she followed after the broad-shouldered man, her eyes and ears opened, her step sure, but soft.Her thick braid fell over her shoulder, and she paused when Otto finally told her the crux of the matter, rather than just speaking about the beast's previous habits. \"What?\" she asked sharply -- not because she hadn't heard, but because she couldn't believe it. Well, she could.She never trusted men, and Otto had just gone and proved why. \"Are you serious? Of course you're serious.\" She reached back for her hatchets, her gloved hand coming comfortably around their handles as she slipped them from their loops -- not to use on him, but to prepare herself.\"My story is that I'm going to help you slay this beast, and then you're going to teach me everything you know about what you do -- and? Never use me as bait again. Without my knowledge,\" Ylva told Otto, glancing over her shoulder at a noise in the forest as she walked, a sway to her hips.So... apparently she wasn't upset that she was used as bait. She was only upset that she didn't know about it before hand. As a hunter tracking, trapping, and killing large predators, she'd often make herself as bait. She looked at him, her face beautiful but stony.\"How are the bodies left?\" she asked him, not shying away from the gory details. \"Were there certain organs missing or eaten? Did they appear torn apart by maw or claw? Or beak? When did it usually strike?\" ", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The horse wasn't a problem for Ylva.

The victims were scratched up, but they were so minor I couldn't tell if it was from the beast or the thorns.\"Otto slowly trudged through the swamp.  He picked up a stick and poked it at the ground ahead of him, judging its solidity.  Lily pads floated in murky green water; it smelled of thick plant life, and the air was heavy with moisture, but it was chilly.  The croak of frogs and light chirping of insects was the only sounds present, aside from the sloshing of water.\u00a0 Otto pulled his sword from its scabbard; it gleamed of silver - a weapon for monster hunters.\u00a0 He slowly trudged through the swamp for a few more minutes, Ylva nearby.\u00a0 He seemed to be circling around a specific spot in the swamp; the water was darker and one could not see the mud beneath, so it must have been deeper.And then a bubbly glurp!Otto immediately stopped moving and looked around, but nothing was in sight, not even at the deep end.\u00a0 He opened his mouth as if to say something and within an instant a wide tail appeared from the mud, slamming into Otto and sending him flying towards the deep part.The creature then protruded from its hiding spot, sliding effortlessly out of the mud and coming into the air like a dolphin out of water.\u00a0 It extended both arms, aimed at Ylva's shoulders, and intended to slam her into the mire!", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://orig07.deviantart.net/7bcd/f/2013/127/3/1/swamp_monster_by_dariocoelho-d64gq4h.jpg"], "html": "\"Mostly struck during the day,\" Otto told her, \"but that's because it has a pattern; simply put, people only traveled in the day, and people only attacked it in the day.
