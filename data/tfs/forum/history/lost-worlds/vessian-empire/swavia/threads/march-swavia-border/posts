It walked slowly, but took heavy and steady steps; it's hooves were caked in dried mud from far-off lands, and it bore scars and abrasions across its body.  It never once neighed, but remained quiet.  It's tail never twitched.  It almost seemed as if it didn't breathe.  It would have been mistaken as some life-like decoy had it not been walking.  The black mane was dark as night, and it's fur impossibly darker.  The rider eventually pulled the reins of the steed to bring it to a halt.  Some nearby soldiers would have heard a faint gurgling growl; definitely the sound of some nightmarish creature, and not that of a horse.The rider was even more fearsome.  His armor was beyond any kind of armor seen by the soldiers here in Vessia.  It was large, stout, and impossibly heavy.  But the warrior was a powerful man, stronger than any normal man, and nearing the height of a giant.  The armor was no heavier nor any more restrictive to him than that of practical steel armor worn by a knight.  The steel was rustic and old, but reliable.  His helmet was shaped in the form of a demon, whose eyes was its visor.  No part of the man was visible, for he was encased in this ridiculous suit of armor.On his back hung a massive executioners sword, with dark red stains on it.  On the side of the horse hung a large round shield made of steel; a large spike embossed in the center.The rider stopped in the night by a campfire of soldiers.  He said nothing, but slowly reached down in one of his bags on the horse's saddle and pulled out a note.  He unraveled it with his huge fingers and read to himself.  It was all encoded, but the warrior knew every word.DIETRICH,I must assume command of the Swavian levies soon.  Go there and give the tribals incentive to side with the Empire.  Do what you were bred for.The note was not signed, and only a small number of Vessians knew the code.  The warrior grunted, some kind of laugh, and then balled up the parchment and threw it into the fire.The horse suddenly reared back, neighed in some husk-like howl, and darted off into the lands of Swavia.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Opposed to the mingling warriors and soldiers traveling in and out of the Swavian boundaries, there came a lone figure."}, "post-58983": {"user": "Adrian von Heschburg", "user_num": 643, "timestamp": "1483379763000", "message": "Adrian, Cerridwyn von Heschburg, Helmut van der Minnenstein, Klaus, and the six Brother Knights rode hard away from Rouviere and towards Swavia.  They completely ignored the main paths, trying to avoid patrols, but there were no set patrols here anyway.  Adrian would lead them to an inconspicuous spot situated upon a hill, with no forest around; such a position would let Adrian see all around him and he would make sure no one was nearby.  He would make absolutely sure that only the current party was in the immediate area.Adrian dismounted his horse and ordered his Knights to take the Witch-Hunter down.  One of the Brothers would administer healing salves that healed Helmut's wounds.  The other Knights all had crossbows aimed directly at Helmut, should he try anything.  As this was going on, Adrian had taken Helmut's items and put them on Lady Cerri's horse.\"Let's get something straight Witch-Hunter.  I shot you, tied you up, and then made you ride on a pony's ass all the way to Swavia.  The whole time I could have killed you.  I could still kill you right now.  But I won't, because it would be utterly pointless.  Go back west.  Go back to your guild and tell your friends.  Go back and tell the Emperor what I have done.  The only person I care about... is Cerri...\"Adrian smacked the rump of Cerri's horse.  \"You can keep the horse,\" Adrian said as it darted off westward with the Witch-Hunter's belongings; it would stop soon enough so Helmut could get on, but by then Adrian and Cerri would be far enough away that trying to turn back and find them would be futile.Adrian and his Knights mounted back up and rode as fast as they could further east.  \"I... I am sorry, my Brothers,\" he would tell his Knights.  \"You must go, for I have no need of you anymore; to stay with me would only put our lives in more danger.\"  The Knight Brothers understood and split up, riding in separate directions to do their own things.Adrian cradled Cerri's head in his arms as he rode eastward... towards someone who might could tell them where Efyria was.<exit>", "link_list": ["/user/1957", "/user/1938"], "image_list": [], "html": "Adrian, "}, "post-58987": {"user": "Helmut van der Minnenstein", "user_num": 1938, "timestamp": "1483382106000", "message": "He would rise unceremoniously, brushing himself off. \"Tell me this Adrian, are you going to tell the girl the truth?
