She felt as if she was in a fog, a daze, perhaps. She wasn't even aware of the passing of hours, she could only think of Ruther...... His body was lying out in the small chapel on the grounds of the humble Castle Reinholdt. Catalina had avoided going there as she hadn't been able to handle it. Every night she cried herself to sleep once the candles were guttered, but in her days she was silent and spoke to no one, wandering the grounds as if she was already a ghost. Her plants in the greenhouse had begun to whither and die...Flowers had to be arranged, however. For the ceremony. She went to her beloved greenhouse and saw how the plants were on the verge of death, whithered and starved of her presence. A few tried to blossom for her, just to feel her near... And she reached out a hand and cradled a bloom. The plant began to gain life, turning green as she looked upon it, and then...suddenly, Lady Catalina went breathless with realization. She took her skirts in hand and she whirled out of the greenhouse, leaving the door open for the crisp coolness of winter to come sweeping into the greenhouse itself. She burst into the castle where the fire in the great hearth was being tended to by sleepy-eyed servants who didn't even bother standing at attention.

At once, he raised a hand to strike her, only catching the right glimpse of her face - her eyes, tear stained cheeks, the dimples of their mother - and he paused. His own expression was one of mixed horror and disbelief. His tender touch to her face was a sharp contrast to his anger moments ago. His voice felt like sandpaper against his throat, his tongue heavy and cumbersome. Servants rushed around, making for Ruther's private quarters, preparing it for his bathing and dressing. Food. Some powders to make him look a little less dead. \"Cat, my sweet Cat..\" he murmured, his hands cupping her face a little more firmly now. \"What have you done..?\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "He was caught, somewhere.
