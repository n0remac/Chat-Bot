Some young nobles visited the capital to become familiar with more prestigious knights, even moreso during events like the upcoming ball.  Their goal was to be appointed as a knight's personal squire, or at least train under them for a duration of time.  Adrian found a promising young lad named Klaus, the son of a Swavian noble.Sixteen year old Klaus was nearly six feet, slightly shorter than his new master.  He had an average body build, not exactly toned or muscular, but one common for his age.  He had short, dark brown hair, but Adrian had the sides shaved, the tops trimmed down, and it would be fixed nicely for the ball.  His scraggly facial hair was shaved completely off, giving him the look of a fresh noble.  He was taught to stand upright, to be alert, and to obey his master's orders.\u00a0 The boy's only companion, aside from his rowdy compatriots, was a Vessian wardog named Shagger.Soon enough Adrian had the squire accompany him to the Imperial blacksmith and armor fitter, where new plate armor was purchased for the ball.\u00a0 A new sword was made as well, along with a heater shield.\u00a0 The sword had a blackened blade, with a white hilt and a black cross embedded into the pommel.\u00a0 The shield was white with a black and gold cross emblazoned upon its surface.\u00a0 His steel plate armor was finished with a black crusading helmet, complete with two great wings.\u00a0 A clothier worked alongside the smith to craft a fine white cloak and surcoat, the latter of which was decorated with a black and gold cross.Klaus was given a court-styled outfit, mostly black and white since he was to be a Brother one day.\u00a0 Adrian went ahead and had the smith craft him a steel sword, and instructed him in the use of a Vessian crossbow.Adrian and Klaus arrived at the courtyard ball together, and poor Shagger had to stay at the kennel for the night.\u00a0 Adrian wore his new suit of armor, glimmering in the rosy, fading, sunlight.\u00a0 His new sword was secured at his side for all to see, and the Black Cross on his chest was sure to attract the attention of the ball-goers.\u00a0 Klaus wore his noble attire, black and white, with his face concealed by a plain white mask - nothing of specific note; being a Brother, he needed to learn that such frivolous masks should not be important.\u00a0 Klaus also had his sword secured at his side, and wore with great pride.\u00a0 He held up Adrian's white cape so as to not let it drag across the courtyard.\u00a0 Adrian's new heater shield was strapped onto his back.Coming to the central fountain, Adrian placed his hands behind his back and looked around at the other ball-goers.\u00a0 \"You can let it down,\" he said to Klaus, who lowered his cape to the ground.\u00a0 \"Stand by my side, and be ready to assist anyone who might come speak to me.\u00a0 If they require drink, find them drink, and if they require a coat rack, then... well, you must become a coat rack.\"Klaus shook his head and smiled.\u00a0 He had already learned that Adrian, while disciplined, shared some common humor from time to time.\u00a0 \"Yes sir,\" he said to his master.", "link_list": ["/user/1958", "http://pre11.deviantart.net/be6d/th/pre/f/2013/330/f/4/knight_of_the_teutonic_order_by_lordhayabusa357-d6vqjur.png"], "image_list": [], "html": "After becoming acquainted with "}, "post-57327": {"user": "Jjaks", "user_num": 1962, "timestamp": "1480730388000", "message": "The masks provided a relative anonymity to the party-goers - there was only so much a mask could cover, and people could not hide their true identity in the gesture of their hands, the curve of their smiles nor the gait of their walks.

Lady Catalina. She was known to be quiet, and at times, to the point. Never totally rude, but very much direct. There was a gentle streak of independence in her, which attracted men who were attracted to confidence... or breaking her spirit. And Ruther wanted to marry her off.That was why they were here tonight. The couple arrived, and people had to double-take, not because Catalina's gown was ornate or bejeweled or made of gold (House Berengar couldnt afford that) but because it was a deep, rich, vibrant scarlet red.It covered more of her body that other gowns present, but it fit her like a glove. Her dark hair was glossy and unbound down her back, left to its natural wave and curl. The red satin didnt wonders against her slightly olive hued skin, and with a handsomely dressed man in deep browns and blacks, they made quite a couple.Their faces were almost entirely hidden. He wore a mask of an owl, slightly gilded and glittery, and she wore the mask of a fox, its nose drawn out from her face where its shadow was thrown over the elegant line of her jaw. The masks truly did conceal their identities, whereas others seemed to be easily recognizable if you had been around the court long enough.\"Ruther... Perhaps I should have worn something else,\" Catalina murmured quietly to her brother, her lips as scarlet as her gown. It was very clever of them, to use a bold and rich color when they could afford no ornamentation. The gown appeared just as wealthy as the others, yet elegant and tasteful as well.\u00a0\"Nonsense,\" Ruther said as his eyes scanned the crowd. \"Attract attention. Find a wealthy man you like. Bend him to your will. That is what tonight is for.\"\"I am not a man eater,\" Catalina scoffed beside him.\"No, but I've found a woman who is,\" Ruther said, his gaze on the Duchess of Hapsburg-Portainne. Who else could it be? No one would be so bold, and her hand held mask was held slightly away from her face so they could see the little curve of her lips.\"Of course you have,\" Catalina sighed as Ruther turned to look at her in his owl mask and grinned a charming smile.\"I'll be back soon,\" he said to his sister before he left her side for the Duchess, who already had several admirers.\"No, you won't,\" Catalina said softly, watching her brother go.She stood alone in the courtyard, unapproached at first as people tried to puzzle out who she could possibly be.

The smile that blossomed across her face couldn't be helped and it made her more enchanting than the roses that encircled the pavilion they were sitting upon. Her fingertips touched over her features delicately, and as the Emperor came to her side and offered his hand, she laid the drawing down and slid her silk palm into his.She swayed into his arms with a grace that spoke of a queen, and a purpose that spoke as if she was MEANT to be there. One hand rested in the width of his war-calloused palm, and the other rested upon his chest.

The Duchess certainly knew how to make... a show of things. It was just as well because she was in naught but a night dress whilst he had sweat a considerable amount, had his previously gelled hair in disarray and all of his clothing ruffled or pulled back as he worked with all sorts of officials. Nevertheless he was keeping deceptively bright maintaining a deep stare into the woman's eyes. \"And why is that?\" He asked when told she said the current situation was better than the masquerade earlier. \"Well then, let us begin.\" He said after being answered. With a nod to the various musicians he had kept back (who were glad that they truly were here to play rather than become a few feet shorter via blade) obliged with a \u00a0elivered by a single man on the ivory keys of his instrument whilst the rest quietly discussed what they should play next, and how having a sudden case of bad memory after the event was a good idea indeed. It wasn't slowly that the Lord of Vessia moved, but rather thoughtfully. Each muscle's tension or relaxation was carefully calculated but in no way planned beforehand. \"So how are Capris and Dareion? Not too shaken by the events? Nor their mother's absence? I can call some men, calm their fears - if you so desire of course.\" He said, blinking shortly. They had the whole courtyard to themselves and could move freely, unimpeded by others in their graceful actions as would otherwise be. Near the end of the piece Aleksander afforded himself one of the fancier actions, where he leaned forward and the two were in incredible proximity; they would be close enough for the warmth of each other's breath to be felt on skin for the few moments they held the position. \"I trust once again, that these events will be kept in secrecy? It would... turn a few heads. I do not propose you lie (despite the slight vocal implication that she would) but simply do not bring the matter up.\" He uttered, somewhat engrossed in the dance. Finally as the first one came to a close, they would once more keep the final form for a few moments and with a sigh of relief (accompanied by a quieter one from the musician) the Emperor withdrew a little. \"Another one?\" He asked with a flick of the head to the musicians.
