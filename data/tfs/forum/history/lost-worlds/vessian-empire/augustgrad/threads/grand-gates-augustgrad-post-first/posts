He sighed, closed his eyes, and prayed for the first time in a long time.The last time Adrian was here in Augustgrad he and his fellow knights were about to be executed.  Returning from the Swavian Rebellions, a number of Vessian Knights found their families brutally murdered or kidnapped.  They decided to take vengeance by marching into neighboring Eastwick and killing any Wickan they found - resulting in the Arburg Massacre.  It wasn't a proud moment, but it was something Adrian didn't exactly regret.  When they returned to Vessia, the former Emperor had promptly arrested the Vessian Knights and was to execute them.  Until, of course, they were released and reorganized into the Brothers of the Sword - and then aimed at pagan Eastwick.He dismounted his white steed and led it towards the gates.  The light wind blew his tattered white caper in the air, while the sun gleamed off of the few shiny pieces left on his crusading armor.  He would stop at a nearby guard and nod at him.  \"Aye, Brother, it's been a while since I've been in Vessia, and even longer since I was in the capital.
