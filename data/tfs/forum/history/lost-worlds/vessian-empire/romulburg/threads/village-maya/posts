Before she even left the manor belonging to only the most successful (and never retiring) merchant in the entire village, if not Swavia, he gruffly muttered, \"Here, lass, ye bring back a trinket fer me love and spend some on yerself.\"Of course, not all of his servants were treated as kind as she... None held a grudge, she did work herself to the bone even if it was to help another servant... She was not trying to advance or uproot others, and her affection for the mistress was quite genuine.

She had never even met the man!Rainne shook her head once she was in the fresh air, sunlight dappled upon the cobbles as fluffy clouds gently rolled overhead. The scent of the sea, briny and sweet, wafted into the Miss' nostrils as she meandered through the Silver District, pausing at various stalls to admire this thing or that.

She decided that this outing would be as enjoyable as she could make it before she gave in to the urge to go back to her duties.She made her way to the square, where prices seemed to be easier to haggle without having her master nearby. She started to shell out coin for things, mostly for the woman who she spent most of her time with, some for the Master, and some for others. As she was about to start heading home to deposit the goods with one of the other servants, a bolt of the prettiest blue fabric caught her gaze; a fabric she had never seen the likes of in her short life, a fabric so blue that it reminded her of the night sky. When it was shifted by the merchant, it had a purple sheen, and she noticed the tiny crystal beads already sewn onto the pretty fabric.\"Oh!\" She approached the stall, and then greeted the familiar merchant, \"How much for that blue fabric..?\" Her face fell as soon as he named the steep price... She almost walked away, when he told her he'd sell it to her on credit, and she could pay her debt by making a fine gown from a velvet fabric he had stashed away for his wife. She eagerly agreed, and was soon laden with so many parcels that she could hardly see above them.Rainne made her way toward the manor, trying to crane her head above the pile in her arms...", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "It was a rare day, indeed, when her aging mistress did not need her every time Rainne turned around.
