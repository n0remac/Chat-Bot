He'd have to investigate more to certain but a picture was already forming in his head. The girls were likely the daughters of a local tradesman, likely a baker. Their father had died and as was their right they'd taken over the business since Nik was rather liberal letting woman own a business as long as they did good work. The girls probably didn't know enough about the trade and had fucked up the bread making a few young men sick, young men since they'd probably targeted them to drum up business. When they realized they were fucking up the bread they started to stay up late to figure out what was going on.
