It was here the village of Erast was located, and where he could find Cerridwyn von Heschburg .  He would have much preferred to accompany the lady back home, especially after her poisoning in the Courtyard, but he ultimately deduced that she was not the assassin's target, and thus relatively safe. It at least freed him up to take care of more business in the capital.The powerful knight rode atop his white steed, white cape flowing gently in the breeze.  Behind him rode a retinue of six other knights, similarly equipped and all bearing mantles of the Black Cross.  Klaus rode at Adrian's side on his own white horse.Coming upon some guards, Adrian halted the convoy and spoke.  \"Hail, and well met, friends,\" he would say.  \"I'm looking for the village of Erast, to see Lady Cerridwyn Rouviere.  Can you give me directions?\"The guards gave Adrian and his Brothers directions and allowed them passage.", "link_list": ["/user/1957"], "image_list": [], "html": "(Sometime after the events of the Ball)"}, "post-69703": {"user": "Percival Whiteriver", "user_num": 2369, "timestamp": "1497925441000", "message": "A young monk arrives soon near the walls of Romulburg.
