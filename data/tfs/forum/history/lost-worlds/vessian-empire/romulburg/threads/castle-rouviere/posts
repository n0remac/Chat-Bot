First and most importantly are the knights being trained for many houses throughout the empire. Squiress pay their own way in order to gain the desired training, which in turn lines the strongboxes with coin.This house prides itself on breeding and training the finest horse stock in the entire empire, from war horses to carriage horses, inferior horses are given to peasants to help work the land. Because of this, there is plenty of dung to fertilize their lands and for the peasant stock to have nice, fat gardens... Rather than feeling oppressed, the peasants are quite happy and willing to work the land.Lastly, there are at least two market stalls in each of the four villages the Lord oversees, that sells tack made by several different leather smiths. The best tack is shipped to the larger cities and it is considered an honor if an elector is seen with a particular smith's gear on their horses.Tax and rent is collected once a month... Because the peasants are so happy, there is plenty of coin to be had without unrest. Lord Raoul makes sure that the empire has what they desire.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i488.photobucket.com/albums/rr250/beaniechick1983/0412871ca1ec534f10289c7e3dfaadf8.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://i488.photobucket.com/albums/rr250/beaniechick1983/0412871ca1ec534f10289c7e3dfaadf8.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/><br><br/><br/>A small, but nevertheless rich estate.</br></div>"}, "post-56508": {"user": "Cerridwyn von Heschburg", "user_num": 1957, "timestamp": "1479966333000", "message": "Her father was away on business, as usual, which meant that she was left to her own devices for a time.

The Knights had bound Helmut van der Minnenstein by the wrists and ankles and disarmed him; the binding was tight and tied efficiently, so he was not going to be able to wriggle free.  Helmut would be laid upon Cerri's horse and tied to the reins and saddle so he could not fall off or try to escape.  The Knights, and Klaus, all mounted up and followed Adrian out of the courtyard's exit, with Helmut in tow.The retinue of Knight-Brothers, with Cerridwyn von Heschburg and Helmut, high-tailed it from the scene - completely ditching all of Cerri's belongings, as it would only slow them down.  Fortunately, the Troopers in the distance who were approaching the castle in a V formation were far enough away, and only walking, so they could surely outrun them if they fled somewhat opposite their direction.As they rode hard away from Rouviere, Adrian would speak to the Witch-Hunter.  \"Honestly, Witch-Hunter, I've no ill feelings towards you.  I am a man of God, and I forgive all of his creatures, no matter the sin.  Because of you, however, I am being forced to flee to Swavia... where I was meant to take command against Queen Efyria.  The Emperor may have to find someone else, I am afraid, for my actions have no doubt labeled me an enemy of the state.  I am going to Swavia to hide.\"Adrian paused, and he knew the Witch-Hunter would want to say something snarky again.  \"Let me guess, your pals are coming,\" he would say.  \"I already considered that.  If anyone comes to hurt us, kill us, or otherwise impede us, I will tell them to move.  If they do not... well, quite frankly, I will kill you.  Does that make sense, Witch-Hunter?  You are my insurance.  If you want to live, then my fiancee and I must make it to Swavia.  Once there, I will release you, heal you, and return all of your items.\"Adrian's expression turned to one of sadness as he gazed into Helmut's eyes.  \"And please, good sir, cooperate... for I do not wish for you to die by the sword.\"Adrian was sincere.  All he wanted to do was make it to the border.  If anyone tried to hurt, hinder, or kill anyone in the party, Helmut himself would be promptly killed.  If they made it to the border safely, Helmut would be released, healed, and re-equipped.", "link_list": ["/user/1938", "/user/1957"], "image_list": [], "html": "All the tension in Adrian's person simply dissipated.

She was much younger and had to deal with less in life; that was someone he could more easily mould to his will.\u00a0\"My life is forfeit. I'm not a coward, I will take death by heretical hands. You on the other hand, are too frightened to even face investigation. However I will tell you once more. Let me live, and the lady just might. Let me leave with her, and your comrades might just live too. Turn yourself in, and you just might. You will have to clear your name with many works but you may return to your old life, if you play your cards however few right. I am an acceptable loss, even though I am second in place to be the High Master of the Witch Hunters. So....\" He said, and added mockingly \"Tick tock.

The men packed everything written and most things that were not. All they took would be sent over to the establishment of the Witch Hunters in Augustgrad but a few specific items to Helmut's home. After he was once more alone he smashed the tables, shelves, and anything else flammable about the place and then began to pour the contents of a bottle of holy wine about the place. Satisfied, he emptied the tobacco of his pipe and smiled as all around him began to burn. Fire was good, it purified. He sniffed the smoke, and just before the red flames caught onto his leather clothing he left, and then admired from afar the castle ablaze. He'd send a message to various Imperial authorities that the castle now belonged to the state. He himself was off to the village o Rouviere, since that was where he reckoned Raoul's wife was.
