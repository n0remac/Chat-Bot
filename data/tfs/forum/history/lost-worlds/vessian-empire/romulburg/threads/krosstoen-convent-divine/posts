The poor woman was stricken with the guilt she must have been feeling for what she had done.\"My dear, you must calm down. We shall think of a solution. Let us pray together--\"\"No! I cannot pray to an idol I've no faith in!\" The younger woman had said that in anger, and struck her palm against the wall. \"I cannot serve the Divine One if blessings are bestowed on that... that lunatic who would kill an innocent child if they but farted magic broke magic wind. No, Prudence. I cannot stand behind that man! You know why.\"Prudence gave a heavy sigh, and rubbed at her forehead. \"How do you propose you leave this convent? Eventually, the emperor would send someone for you. How am I to explain your disappearance?\"\"I have to die.\"She sighed heavily and got up from her chair, seeing no need to rush, Hayan already appeared to be \"dead,\" and Prudence had a job to do. She wasn't happy, there was no need to fake the stricken look on her face... But she also had to be calm; a pillar of strength for the women who called this place home.When she arrived in the chapel, she knelt by the \"dead\" woman and gently rolled her onto her back, then crossed the woman's arms over her chest as she began to pray. \"Oh, great Divine One, please deliver dear Hayan. Take her into your arms and give her the comfort she so desperately sought. She was troubled so, and failed to see your shining beacon. Please, oh Divine One, show her the light, brighter than the sun so she might find her way back to you in death when she could not in life. I pray in your most glorious honor. Amen.\"This prayer was obviously not their version of the last rites, considering what Hayan had \"done\" was considered the ultimate sin and therefor, she could not even be entombed in the catacombs. Her body had to be cremated on a pyre... Or rather... the body of a woman who could pass for Hayan needed to be burned and Hayan needed to be moved to the catacombs where she would leave through once she rose from the dead.\"Sister Anise, I would speak to you on this matter soon. Please retrieve a shroud and bring back Sister Cadence and Sister Luna with a litter. We must move her from the chapel.\" She stood and shook her head sadly, before looking at Father Wolfgang, real tears in her eyes that added effect, but the old nun was trying to keep it together. \"You must forgive the circumstances. This is the first time something like this has ever happened, and you can be sure the matter will be taken care of hastily. I am sure you did not come all this way to witness this.

He rubbed his lame leg some more.  \"My leg... it gives me troubles.  I was part of a convoy escorting a group of pilgrims in Eastwick.  We were ambushed, and while I was on my horse one of the pagans swiped a large battleaxe my way.  It ripped the platemail clean off my thigh, and ripped my leg wide open; it was dark and in the confusion I did not stop to see the damage done.  Any normal man may have run, but I knew it to be a test from the Divine One.  So I kept fighting, circling around the pilgrims as they fled in a hurry to safety.\"Wolfgang rubbed his finger across the mace at his side.  A dark red color rubbed off onto his hand; dried blood, perhaps?\"When it was all over I passed out from exhaustion and blood loss.  I awoke in a tent of the pilgrims, where one had tried to stop the bleeding and bandage my leg up - blessings of the Divine One be upon her.  But she was not exactly surgeons... a lot of shards and infection was left in the wound.  When I made it to a proper surgeon, they opened the wound and dug out the infection, shards, and other undesirable findings...\"He sighed heavily.  \"I never could walk straight again.  My body can't support a suit of armor anymore.  I can hardly swing my mace.  I certainly can't hold a proper shield.\"  He seemed sad and angry all at once.  \"I curse that pagan who rendered my leg lame.  But instead of wallowing in my self pity, I decided to serve the Brothers as a priest... religious and emotional support, you know?  Because believe me... they needed it.\"When he was finished, flashes of memories ran through his head.
