On top deck the slaves could hear \"hold!\" as the ship's captain ordered a halt.  They sighed in relief after bringing the ship to a halt, and then began to savor their moment of rest.Back on top, the captain pointed to a sandy shore.  \"That'll be our destination,\" he informed to the Ponician diplomat.  The diplomat nodded in agreement and the captain issued orders to the oar-slaves in order to pull up along the shore.  Those who savored their rest for to long were reminded of their servitude with a sharp lash of the slave-driver's whip.A number of well-armed warriors checked their armor and weapons.  They were adequately armed, only hear to protect the diplomat - nothing more.  They each had their own spear, shield, and xiphos, wearing their own helmets, shinguards, and breast plates; they were mercenary warriors, drawn from the satraps of the Ponician Republic, sworn by coin to serve their Ponician overlords.
