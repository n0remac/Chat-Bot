The last time he was here his hometown, Heschburg, was burned to the ground, and its people slaughtered or enslaved by the Wickans.  It was that moment he followed a knight, Konrad, into Eastwick and assisted in the Massacre of Arburg - where Vessian knights and other volunteers brutalized some pagan Wickans in a sort of revenge-fueled escapade.They returned to Vessia, only to be arrested by the Emperor, and were to be sentenced to death.  However, they were reorganized into a holy order: the Brothers of the Sword, and sent back into Eastwick to end the pagan threat once and for all.  After their success they spread throughout the world, and even established their own state: the Duchy of Audria, a client state of Vessia.  With the order's successes there, Konrad and many knights settled down and now live happily in their newly-conquered home.But for many knights who did not wish to stop their quest, they were forced to search elsewhere for glory.  Adrian had a hard time finding new purpose, and so decided to return to Vessia.  He had been back home for many years, and was out of the loop in current events - practically a foreigner.And so the white steed carried the weary knight across the Land Bridge, accompanied by other Brothers of the Audrian Order, with the intent to seek new purpose...", "link_list": ["/user/1951"], "image_list": [], "html": "An armor-clad knight atop a white horse approached the Land Bridge of "}, "post-56735": {"user": "The Divine Empire of Vessia", "user_num": 1951, "timestamp": "1480277178000", "message": "The land-bridge would be rather quiet and uneventful for most of the trek.

The last few rays of the day were slowly retreating over the horizon with the casting orb of warmth as it settled to rest. The idea of stopping to do just the same was a tempting one, and probably a safer option than attempting.At a glance, a young man eases his steps to come to a gradual stop - the hand resting easily under the chin of the grey Shire mare that pulled along a worn but simple wagon with a burlap tarp lashed down across the top, and bringing her to stop with him. He showered her in thankful affection with a few pats along her face and stroking her mane. A powerful but beautiful animal, who was a good friend.The man reached beneath the front of the wagon, before the wheels, and released a pair of legs to let them stand - then releasing the animal from her harness so it would rest without completely tip forward on the only pair of wheels it was built upon. With a few soft words he gave her hindquarters a pat, letting her wander off the worn road to find the grassy expanses to graze at her leisure. He, however, moved to the wagon again to retrieve the few items he had carried along and what little firewood he had to create a small fire pit for the night. It wouldn't be long before the night fell and the fire eventually grew to light. A carefully wrapped package was found and the paper unwrapped to find a few cuts of salted elk meat. A couple of them were skewered and set over the flames to cook. In the meantime, he stretched out as far as he could on the ground with arms over his head - taking solace in the sense of relief he felt in his body when he relaxed afterwards.He had to admit, despite the fact he was looking to settle down... lying under the stars was actually refreshing.", "link_list": ["https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/97/f6/b7/97f6b71b7df03b90a4a64bed0f6bf682.jpg"], "image_list": [], "html": "A weary evening - the stars were already starting to pop up one after another as the sky deepened to a darker shade of the night and twinkle across the canvas.
