They've already sought refuge inside.\"  Olav knew this because of the smoke rising and fading in the midday air, undisturbed by the light breeze.  \"I'd suggest landing upriver and assaulting from foot.\"  Adrian glanced back and nodded, giving Olav the order to land.  The captain responded in kind and made preparations.  This was a sound strategy, lest enemy archers rain down fire arrows on their wooden boats.\"Cerri,\" Adrian turned to his future wife before leaving the ship, taking her by the arms.  \"The women and children may be afraid, but rest assured we'll keep them safe.  I need you to check on the families, make sure everyone is okay.  You can join me in the tent afterwards.\"  Adrian raised the Lady's hand and kissed it before turning to exit.It would take a short while before the soldiers collected their gear and disembarked, but in that time Adrian called together his subordinates.  A white tent was hastily pitched around a wooden table, and chairs would allow the guests a place to sit.  Pennants displaying the Black Cross fluttered in the gentle breeze.  Helmut and Vidkun would be invited, as would Daimyo Akagi.  Finally the Hochmeister suggested the mercenaries, Zatch and Kaine, to be allowed inside.  When they all took their seats Adrian would sit at the head of the table.\"The hillfort is just a half hour's march south from here,\" the Hochmeister began, clasping his hands together and resting his elbows on the table.  \"If we wait to long the enemy may send a relief force, so must take the fort as quickly as possible.  I suggest an attack on from the north; our infantry can scale the walls using siege ladders, advancing under the cover of crossbowmen, who will be supplied with mantelets.  When the first wave has opened the gates a second wave of infantry will advance and seize the central keep.  Kill any man who brandishes a weapon, but spare the weak and defenseless.  The women and children must not be harmed.\"  Adrian paused for a short moment and glanced over those within the tent.  \"Any questions?\"The Brotherhood had 500 sergeants with them, as well as 100 Knight-Brothers and 200 crossbowmen.  His strategy would see the sergeants advance during the first wave, with covering fire provided by the crossbowmen.

For his assistance the men were able to safely get their ladder up and assault the walls.  Across the ways Vidkun was also clearing out ample room for the besieging force.  Their success was further helped with the complete eradication of the archers on the top of the keep, thanks to Murat.The pagans fought with zeal and fury, but a combined assault on the northern and western walls was to much for them.  One by one they were cut down.  Those who were not killed instantly were trampled under foot and suffered an agonizing death.  All of the pain they had dealt to the Vessian colonists was in turn inflicted upon them.  Heads rolled, shoulders split, and knees buckled backward as the rage of battle descended into the central courtyard.  Murat's Pegasus Knights would have had a harder time clearing out the keep.  Those men were better armored and equipped with better weapons, not to mention more desperate.Brother Helman, who was fighting on the walls, spied his allies proximity to the gate mechanisms.  He quickly drew his horn and blew into it.  Within moments he heard the sweet sound of horse hooves.They thundered from across the empty field, cloaked in the dense fog.  They converged and came together in a column formation, pennants fluttering wildly as they closed the distance.  At the forefront was Hochmeister Adrian himself, lowering his lance.A terrible sound occupied the air as men's bodies were skewered with the Brothers' lances.  Man flesh met horse flesh, bones cracked, the wounded cried out, and a host of warhorses occupied the central courtyard.  After the initial charge the Knight-Brothers drew axes, swords, maces, and flails - turning about and caving in the heads of their opponents, or cracking their skills.  Blood sprayed into the air, covering the walls and ground with the red substance.  A broken mess of flesh and bone littered the earth.  It was truly horrifying, but all of the men involved roared and fought on.When it became apparent the pagans had lost, they threw down their weapons and backed away.  They had surrendered.  A few overzealous fighters did not get notice this at first and cut down a few defenseless pagans.\"Enough!\"  Adrian roared over the chaos.  \"Enough!\"  He ripped his helmet from his head and held his hands up, standing up in his stirrups.  The deafening sound of battle ceased.  The sound of woman's cries came from within, mixed with that of children.  The wounded tried to cry out for help as well.The Hochmeister looked around, victorious but also regretful.  \"Bind the survivors; lock them up and keep them under guard here in the courtyard.
