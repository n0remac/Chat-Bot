the ships drew up anchor and started to row out into the sea...Coasts of Ostfront...It would take a few weeks before the fleet reached the Mouth of the Dauva, which was the targeted destination.\u00a0 From there the Brothers could establish a base of operations, taking advantage of the river.\u00a0 The Dauva would not only provide the settlers with freshwater and food, but it would serve as a vital component in the crusade: bringing much-needed supplies and crusaders into Ostfront.\u00a0 At least, this is what Adrian predicted, scanning over the roughly-drawn map of Ostfront.He rubbed the tiredness out of his eyes; the ship lulled about, trying to coax him into sleep.\u00a0 He barely had any rest, staying up late to study the maps of Ostfront.\u00a0 Some journals and letters, collected from Vessian merchants who had visited the frontier, sat on the opposite end of his desk.\u00a0 He folded up the map and placed it on top of the books before looking out of the window.\u00a0 The sun was coming up; it was foggy out, but he could still see the faint light of the sun.\u00a0 He cursed in his head as he realized morning was upon him.He turned to see Cerridwyn von Heschburg , who lay on the soft bed on the other side of the cabin.\u00a0 Olav had been kind enough to allow Adrian and Cerri to sleep in the captain's cabin.\u00a0 Most of the Knight-Brothers and sailors slept topside; very few sought rest below deck as the smell of dung, piss, and sweat permeated the wooden walls.\u00a0 He lazily grinned at Cerri, appreciating her beauty.\u00a0 In the darkness of this world she was his only light.", "link_list": ["/user/1957"], "image_list": [], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><i><b>In Vessia...</b></i><br/></div>"}, "post-63668": {"user": "Cerridwyn von Heschburg", "user_num": 1957, "timestamp": "1492980011000", "message": "Cerridwyn was clearly asleep, which was something she did quite a bit, hiding away in the captain's quarters quite a bit to get away from the rather disgusting scents upon the ship in general.

She was a beacon of light set upon the bleak fog; an island of hope inset on this cold, miserable sea.  He was happy, happier than he had ever been - but he also felt sorry, and regretful.  How it pulled at his morality and conscious that he had not only broken his vows, but also brought her out to sea.  But she would be fine; he would make sure of that.  His resolve was unmatched.He looked away from Cerri and back to the southerly shore, refocusing on what Helmut was saying.  \"...properly married have you...\" the Witch-Hunter continued with his incessant nagging.  It could get annoying, and at times nigh intolerable, but the Hochmeister maintained his resolve.  Adrian would need all the help he could get, and he knew the Witch-Hunter would pull his own weight.Adrian mentally sighed and replied to his ally.  \"Marriage isn't a priority,\" he said.  Any casual or compassionate habits he had adopted during his time with Cerri had all but vanished, except in the Lady's company; the strict, to-the-point tones familiar to him resurfaced in no time, especially now.  \"The Lady has a role to play in the coming crusade,\" he continued, \"she may prove to be a valuable asset.  Above all things, The Lady's touch is good for the settlers' morale; seeing a noble lady like her inspires them.\"And indeed it had.  If Cerri or Helmut had been paying attention to the non-combatants they would have observed such optimism.  It was one thing to be lorded over by war-mongering knights and fanatical witch-hunters, but Cerri's presence seemed to sooth those men, women, and children who shared a common love for peace and gentleness.  Her pregnancy would only serve to represent the potential for New Life on the Amber Coast.\"Bring a Priest if you must,\" Adrian told Helmut, \"if we are to be married, it will be like you said: later.  The crusade comes first.  Our main focus is to establish a beachhead, proper defenses, and a port.\"  Adrian looked back at the rest of the fleet.  \"The Brothers will provide an adequate defense until the Imperial crusaders arrive.\"Adrian paused for a moment and collected his thoughts.  \"The maps indicate a hillfort along the Dauva.  These fortress are ancient, and have been used by the locals for centuries.  Women and children may seek refuge in them, and a handful of men can defend the walls against an entire army until a relief force arrives.\"  Adrian shook his head and spoke confidently, \"but they are no match for the Brotherhood.  We will take the fortress as quickly as we are able.  The settlers may seek shelter there if we are attacked, and our soldiers can hold the walls against the pagans.  Temporary shelters will be hastily constructed around the fort to provide living quarters for the colonists, and the farmers may begin to lay claim to their plots.  Lumberjacks can fell the trees for the necessary supplies with which to build permanent homes and artisan lodgings.  Hunters and fishermen will begin collecting food.  The miners will be directed to a nearby quarry to gather stone, and the masons will use the stone to replace the wooden hillfort.\"Adrian envisioned a stone fortress, surrounded by a growing town, which in turn would be surrounded by a stone wall.  It would take time, but it would serve as the heart of the crusading effort.  \"Best of all,\" the Hochmeister continued, \"this particular hillfort is situated near the river.  A port will allow trade to flourish and fill our coffers, and offer suitable docks for arriving crusaders and supplies.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Adrian watched Cerri lean upon the rails of the ship.
