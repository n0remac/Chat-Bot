However, upon noticing the identity of the arrivals, and how they\u2019re not reinforcements from the cartel, she exhales slightly, and dissipates the magic from her gem harmlessly.

Having been addressed, she nods once in acknowledgement, but offers no words, intentionally not offering forgiveness. Not yet, at least.

Preparations for the arrival of the two started when it was noted Naoki and Sasha were in the same building. Though they were not sure of her exact place within the organization, the spy network was aware the noble woman was connected to the Lutin Cartel. The warrants for her Sasha's capture were issued the moment the words Fairy Dust left Sasha's mouth. Even then the response was faster than normal. A fact which is easily explained when one remembers the time dilation powers Echoes possesses. Relative to the two the events had transpired nearly 30 minutes ago.The Gauldish government was also quite aware of the drug problem in Bayonne. They had done much to mitigate it's spread to other cities. However, illicit substances and criminal behavior were nearly impossible to stamp out completely. This was largely due to the fact that they didn't have the resources to spy on everyone and everywhere. The Gauldish ward net could provide location information. The travel papers could provide scrying access. But they didn't have the man power to have eyes everywhere all the time. Also citizens of Gauldin didn't have travel papers only visitors. None of this would be explained to Naoki or her party of course. State secrets and methods had to be kept quiet. Viddik snaps his fingers and invisible bands of air tether Sasha's hands to her side. With a gesture the woman is pulled forward to stand next to the commandant. It is an intensely unpleasant experience for her. He then says in a very low growl.\"Keep your mouth shut or I will shut it for you. You should just be grateful the warrant King Renaux issued specified that you had to be brought in alive. There is nothing I'd enjoy more than immolating you, you drug dealing floozy.\"The mages eyes then turn to Naoki. \"If you have any questions Lady, you can ask them now.
