As he slumped against the side of a building, he marveled at his consciousness. Even now the pain was ebbing, the ichor stain on his once cut robes flaking off and falling away. It was the first time he had been stabbed, and it wasn't an enjoyable experience. In the moment, he had fully expected to die, but instead, the attacker had been flung away, as though a great hand had interceded, tossing the man away like an irritating insect.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Several minutes later, Maes picked himself up and shook the alley\u00a0grime from his robe. Again his quarry had escaped, like a whisp of smoke through a cracked window, leaving the bodies of his men in his place. Maes stepped back into the room, an oil lamp hanging from the ceiling, flickering to itself as though nothing out of the ordinary had just happened. These men, these brigands, cutthroats, and thieves deserved their end, no doubt, but more importantly, they wouldn't be needing whatever ill-gotten valuables they had accumulated. Maes relieved the corpses of their prizes.\u00a0\u00a0 He had tracked the leader of these murderous cretins through three cities already, leaving their bodies in his wake. Surely this man must run out of hiding holes soon. Maes would not rest until he avenged his friends, his teachers, his parents. The comfort of knowing his hunt would one day end was all that kept him going most days. After that, the void, or whatever mysterious entity had given him the powers he used to exact justice, could take him for all he cared.\u00a0\u00a0 Maes stepped back into the alley and\u00a0looked up at the sky. The sun, somewhat obscured by foundry and pitch smoke, did its best to draw the shadows away from the alley. Maes was thankful for the smoke as shadows now gave him some sort of undeniable comfort. Best to put some distance between the scene and himself though, he thought.

He looked around, cognizant of the alley, the place where had earlier in the week almost caught up to Regadar. And now he knew that Regadar worked for a group of people with few to no scruples. He also knew that Regadar was still in Bayonne.\u00a0 \u00a0He was becoming dimly aware of the pain in his forearms and shins and looked down to see charred flesh marring the pale alabaster of his skin. That wasn't going to be enjoyable when the numbness wore off. Fortunately, it seemed like the melted flesh was already repairing itself. Whatever powers the voice had given him, supernatural healing was definitely the one that put the icing on the tart.\u00a0 \u00a0Still, whatever this Godmother and her associates had over Regadar, it seemed trivial to him. If they stood in the way of his vengeance, and if they were responsible for the murderer's actions, they'd be ground to dust along with him. But he would have to be smarter now. They knew he was here and they knew his goal. Surely they'd be on the lookout to protect one of their assets.

It was only natural that she felt fear -- fear was her survival instinct, after all, but Rafaela was pretty adept at not showing it.Then again, there were some that could smell\u00a0it, and perhaps the scent of it might have lingered subtly about her now, even if she did fire off another quicksilver smile at him.\"And you're stealthy, too,\" she said, taking his measure in what she could see of the darkness. She took a step towards him, her hips rocking with her confidence as she made a free gesture with one hand, the other still hovering by her shapely, leather-clad thigh. \"Have you ever indulged in other crime? I mean other than petty theft and drug use.\"Once more, that charming little one-shoulder shrug. \"Out of curiosity.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "What had she been expecting, exactly?

I probably would have killed that dealer if you didn't see me,\" he said. He jumped down from the post then, landing in the middle of the alley again where he had left his shirt before reverting back to a human form and slipping the garment back on.\u00a0\"Why do you ask about the crimes I have committed anyways?\" he asked, now human eyes regarding her.

Perhaps she did excuse it. He was nothing but a dirty drug addict; what drug addict didn't\u00a0indulge in a little homicide to get their next fix?\"I mean real crime. Like, oh... treason, perhaps? Grand Theft from mm... I don't know, the City Treasury?\" Back in his human form, he seemed much less intimidating, but Rafaela wouldn't forget what he could become... what he hadn't\u00a0become in front of her. She wasn't a fool. Quite the opposite. She was a selfish survivalist that knew how to play her odds. Enigma, for whatever reason, seemed to like her or at the very least not mind her presence. She'd be an idiot to ruin her chances when she wasn't even altogether sure what her chances were.Besides, she could always use a scapegoat in her grand adventures.\"But if that's too wild for you, we can always go with... crimes that aren't really crimes. For instance; stealing from the cartel. And by stealing, I mean completely emptying their cache of goods, down by the docks.\"She tipped her head in the direction she was indicating, and for the first time since she'd been in his presence, she smiled a smile that was meant to be charming and perhaps even a little sensual.
