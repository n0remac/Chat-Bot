She wears, as she tends to, one of her loose white blouses, which is today complemented with a pleated black mini-skirt. The only designation of her station- aside from being a highly recognizable figure, is the signet ring on her left hand bearing Isra\u2019s Sun insignia. As she makes her way down the street leading away from the dock, she holds her hands clasped one in the other behind her back, idly observing her surroundings. The Port City of Bayonne. Known for many things. Being Gauldin\u2019s primary port on the mainland, for one thing. The majority of Gauldin\u2019s imports and exports come through this city on their way to the rest of Gauldin. Even now, glancing off to one side down the waterfront, Naoki can see a cargo vessel bearing Isra\u2019s flag, docked, and unloading goods. One of the components of the trade agreements she forged.As the piers and warehouses of the docks fade into the background behind her, the shining marble buildings of the Diamond District come into view. The first thing that comes to mind when most individuals think of Bayonne. An affluent monument to frivolous waste of money earned illicitly. Just looking at it brings a foul sort of taste to Naoki\u2019s mouth. When she had visited The Palace, what with its golden extravagance, she had felt a similar sort of feeling. But it was more understandable in that case. Here\u2026 here it\u2019s just waste for the sake of it, nearly. There doesn\u2019t seem to be- as far as Naoki can tell, any particular reason to have all of this here. Beyond being a port, the city wouldn\u2019t seem to have anything particularly special about it. It\u2019s one thing to have one\u2019s capital kept as fancy as all of this, but Bayonne would just seem to be a port city. Perhaps it was the capital in the past. Naoki resolves to research such things later, and returns her attention to the present, pausing and turning about to face her companions. \u201cSo! Bayonne.

Nothing immediately presents itself. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, then Liz, let\u2019s go find whoever runs this place, and pester them for a while. Maybe they\u2019ll have a suggestion.\u201dReaching into the pouch on her hip, Naoki pulls out a small stack of golden coins. Just enough to glimmer and clink against each other. Turning around abruptly, she makes her way over to one side of the street, where a narrow alleyway between two buildings evidently conceals something. Flashing a smile and holding the coins visibly in one hand, the approaches the mouth of the alley, and pauses just outside. The backside of her figure obscures whatever it is that\u2019s in the alley, but it\u2019d seem as if she\u2019s having a conversation- either with the alley itself, or someone or something inside. Snippets of Gauldish waft back, but not quite enough to discern the nature of the exchange. After a few moments have passed and a fair share of words have been shared, Naoki nods at the alley, extends the coin-holding hand, and turns about to re-approach the group. She takes a moment, smirking to herself, to orient herself to some landmark or another, before pointing off to her left, back toward the docks. \u201cThis way to the governor\u2019s office.\u201d", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\u201cHm.
