When she drew her flamberge near him, Fol-lu's muscles tensed, although the motion was barely visible visually. During that time he had also dropped his hands below the table he sat at, fingers wrapping around the edge as if to respond to her attack by flipping the table. This motion was soon disguised as Fol-lu casually placing his hands in his lap as the flamberge found a different target, a would be thief.In response to this turn of events, Fol-lu would only raise his eyebrows slightly in surprise as she sat next to him. A brief word of thanks was all he was able to get out before the white-haired woman seemed to begin conversing with another. He would have to be more careful with the thieves around here, he thought to himself. There was a peculiar aura coming from that red-haired woman, an aura of pure lust that made even Fol-lu somewhat uncomfortable. Perhaps this aura effected him more so due to the fact that it had been centuries since he last partook in such pleasures, and for the most part those previous encounters had not been out of love, but duty. He had had a duty to make heirs as the Emperor of the Fol-empire previously, even though he outlived all his heirs, and even his grand-kids. It was for that reason he stopped having any heirs with his various elven queens, and then eventually he opted to just rule alone.\u00a0It was truly a terrible predicament for any being to be in, especially one who felt emotions much like others did. Eternal life was more a curse than a blessing, and it had caused Fol-lu to view others as nothing but temporary, fleeting presences in this world. As sources of happiness and pleasure for only a short time before they would die and lead to a much longer period of pain and sadness. It was simply not worth it to Fol-lu to actually enter a long-term relationship for this reason, but his avoidance of such left him feeling alone quite often.During this brooding, the man who had previously tried to steal from him had returned some time later into the night, and this time Fol-lu noticed him. He seemed to have some company this time, and all the men seemed somewhat pissed off. Fol-lu looked around for a moment, the tavern was pretty empty at this point as most had retired to sleeping upstairs, and only the truly devout alcoholics and night-dwellers remained.\u00a0The three men who approached Fol-lu were clearly only here for conflict, as far as Fol-lu could tell. Sighing, the elf would stand up and face the men as they approached, a particularly burly man leading the front, with the thief from before on his left flank and a man who looked oddly similar on his right. As they approached Fol-lu would narrow his eyes dangerously,\"What do you want?\" Fol-lu demanded in a calm but deadly tone. The lead man, who was somewhat bigger than the others, and had about two inches of height on Fol-lu sneered, \"You know damn well what we want, pointy eared freak, where is the white-haired woman who sliced up my little brother. You can tell us, or we can beat it out of ya, your choice.\"Fol-lu snorted then in amusement, as he took in the three men who stood before him, \"Now, I do know where she is, but why would I tell you? I have many more options than you'd think. For example, what would happen if I just hand all three of you your asses? That way, I get to have some fun and I don't have to tell you anything. Your brother was trying to steal from me and she stopped it, so I will not give her away either way.\"\"Besides, you should consider my refusal to tell you were she is a favor, because you'd get a lot worse than a beating if you try and go after her,\" Fol-lu added offhandedly. The whole time Fol-lu spoke he could see the three of them start fuming. The elf that stood before them seemed infinitely arrogant in his words, despite his inferior position in this encounter, and for that reason they attacked, \"Stupid elf! We'll teach ya a lesson not to mess with us!\"Immediately, all eyes in the tavern would turn towards the unfolding brawl as it commenced with the loud shouting. The lead man would attack first, and all to predictably with a punch flying straight for Fol-lu's face. This was an easy attack to forsee due to Fol-lu's attentiveness to the man's body as it winded up for the attack. A clenched fist at his side, along with the tensing of muscles gave Fol-lu all the foreshadowing he needed to simply step forward and to the inside of the man's pump with the grace of a ballroom dancer. In the next moment, Fol-lu wrapped his left hand around the man's outstretched right wrist as he locked the man's upper arm between his own arm which closed like a pincer on it. In the next moment, before the other two could react Fol-lu would bend low, still holding the man's arm as he launched the other man upwards with the straightening of his legs under the man's hips. At the same time Fol-lu would pull the man's arm, sending the huge man flying over his shoulder with ease.\u00a0The man would crash into the floor with a crack, whether that was the wooden floor or his bones, Fol-lu did not stop to find out. Still having a grasp on the fallen man's arm with his left hand, Fol-lu would deliver a swift punch straight in the man's nose with his right fist before turning towards the others. All of these actions to take down the first man would have happened in seconds. This however did not seem to deter the other two from trying their hand however.The thief from before would break into a run, yelling angrily at Fol-lu as he did so. Fol-lu would merely hold his ground until the last second, where he would side-step the man's charge, sweeping his lead foot out from under him moments before it touched the ground \u00a0as well as grabbing the man by his shirt and sending him tumbling into the wall behind Fol-lu. The man would hit the wall head first and enter the dream world with his other fallen brother. Last, and certainly least was the third man, who attempted keeping his distance and throwing a chair at Fol-lu. Fol-lu would simply duck under this flying chair, which broke against the wall behind him before bursting forward to attack the man. Fol-lu would step forward with his right foot, snap-kicking the man in his stomach as he did so with the speed of a striking cobra. As the man bent over, Fol-lu's fist would come down on the back of his head in a hammer-like motion to finish the job.\u00a0The tavern was then suddenly and shockingly silent in the aftermath of the brawl, and as Fol-lu looked around he could see the startled and shocked faces of many of the patrons, along with a few who carried on drinking as if nothing happened. Fol-lu would just sigh, brushing himself off after the brawl, not that he had gotten dirty at all.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "As Raena walked in, Fol-lu's observant gaze fell upon her and watched her as she approached him.
