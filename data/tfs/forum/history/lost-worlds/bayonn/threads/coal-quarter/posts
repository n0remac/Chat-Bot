It's not safe to walk the streets, day or night, without some manner of protection. Despite the dirt and filth, there's still a sort of sparkle about the place.

In this pack each one carried with them a pink-tinted bread with a deep red crust.This bread they gave freely to the residents of the coal district.  To the addicts, the poor, the crippled, all would be fed this day.There were of course some that tried to take more than their fair share.  They were quickly set upon by the group and swatted away, they would pay their tithe later.In the center of the circle stood a man clad in black and red leather.  He preached as the circle made its way through the filthy streets.  \"There was a time when I was not unlike yourselves, broken, defeated, lost in worldly pleasure, but it need not be that way!  Take this bread, and with the energy it gives you fill your veins with life once lost! Rejoice, citizens of Bayonne, Omir comes!  He has shed his own blood to wash away our sins with, and to drink to fill ourselves with, he asks only that we repay the same when we can.  Keep your coin and with it feed your family, fill them with the life of Omir as well, and let it be known that all are welcome to our life bread.\"They made their way through the streets, working their way in a rouch circle, eventually arriving back at what was currently serving as a cathedral and warehouse.  Already, their sat inside a dozen meager folks, each with bread in hand, each sitting atop a barrel, their rag-covered  and swollen feet given a rare respite.  One of them, barely more than a girl, who had been coming for several days spoke thusly \"I've never been treated this way before, are all of you this kind?\"\"What is your name sister?\" Says the man in black leather       \"They call me Ahremen Arkah\"\"Ahremen, do you wish to know how far the kindness of of Omir goes?\" Highlan kneels so that he is looking up into her sullen eyes\"I-I don't know...\"Highlan pulls from his waist a long, thin, curved dagger.  The girls eyes fill with fear, but instead of moving toward her, Highlan pulls the blade to his own wrist and in one quick motion makes a shallow cut that sends a few droplets of blood flying.  He raises his wrist to the girl and places his other hand on the back of her head.  He whispers softly \"Drink, child and feel the life of Omir remake you.\"The blood flows from his wrist to her mouth as their eyes remain locked, the others, both priest and vagabonds alike all watch, as her sunken pale eyes seem to take on the sparking shade of blue of a newborn babe.\"Ahremen, know this Omir gives to us his own blood so that we might live, I have given you nothing that was not once given to me, I would ask only that you do the same.\"\"I...\"  Her voiced cracked, and then a more resolute look came across her face \"I will.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "A circle of men and women moved about the dirty streets, every one of them clad head to toe in red cloth."}, "post-19990": {"user": "Ahremen Arkah", "user_num": 955, "timestamp": "1451433188000", "message": "     A few weeks ago, this old warehouse had been a wreck, filled with garbage both material and human and on it's last leg as a structure.  Now though, after being repaired with the wood of a scuttled ship, and what could be scavenged from the area of donated by new followers, the sense of imminent collapse was long gone.  The old building was even starting to take on its own kind of peculiar beauty.  The windows were no longer shattered and dusty, but instead gleamed.  Old wood had been sanded, painted, polished, or even replaced entirely where necessary.  An entirely new structure rose from the top, something akin to a bell tower.         Ahremen approached this chapel from the dirty street, taking in the stark contrast between the red building and the hovels on either side of it.  She scoffed at the vagrants collapsed against walls or even laying in the gutter as she passed.  She did notice the red crumbs that dotted most of their beards and covered their dirty rags though and a half smile crossed her face.  Her own red dress hovered just over the dusty road those others lay in, perpetually on the verge of being marred with grime, but never quite letting it happen.  Her shining silver breast plate seemed immune to dirt altogether, as if it only allowed even the light to touch it out of vanity.     She flung open the heavy doors to the temple itself allowing them to crash into the walls to either side.  A mass of red robes rose in greeting and bowed hoods mumbled words of respect as she passed.  Eight bodies separated from the rest and formed two squares behind her four women behind her left arm and four men behind her right.         \"Father!\" she shouted, her high pitched voice echoing sharply through the many empty hallways and spaces in the building.  From behind a corner, a dark figure appeared mere inches in front of her face.  \"Yes, my little red rose?\"  he said with a smile on his face.  \"We need to talk.\"  Looking around, she added \"In private.\"       \"Very well, Ahremen\" The man in black leather turned and began walking back the way he had appeared from and Ahremen dutifuly and silently followed, her eight guards still behind her keeping perfect pace.           Eventually they came to a metal-reinforced heavy wooden door.  The eight guards turned inward and assumed a stiff position with their hands clasped behind their backs and feet shoulder width apart. Ahremen followed her father inside.  \"Things are progressing faster than we expected, we have reports of a rather... artistic display in the park.\"     The man sat down in a plainly made wodden  chair and leaned back, lifting the front two legs off the ground.  \"We make no move until I speak to my old friend, we are new in this land and will draw suspicion if we act too boldly.\"     She huffed at that, \"Your old friend had better bring plenty of friends of his own, this latest little vandal has the entire country in one hell of a tizy, as if recent events didn't already.\"     \"Yo misunderstand little rose, that is exactly what we need, people in fear seek instruction, protection, a source of inspiration from on high, and we are all of that and more.\"  He paused for a moment, allowing his chair to drop back forward.  \"Enough, you clearly still have much to learn about these sorts of things.  Go forth and do the bidding of Omir, eighth inheritor of the God's blood, Ahremen Arkah\"     With that, Ahremen whipped around and left the room, slamming the door behind her, and ignoring the eight guards as they took up their constant watch again. \"You would think such an old man would move faster, at this rate he won't even be around to see all his work come to fruition, pft.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "     A few weeks ago, this old warehouse had been a wreck, filled with garbage both material and human and on it's last leg as a structure.

At the time, I believed their off shoot cult of Imperial beliefs to be heretical, however beggars can't be choosers. I sailed with them, tolerated and tolerating for a full year.  One the anniversary or my arrival, I was taken out on deck in the middle of the night, beaten senseless, lashed, cut, bludgeoned and a million other tortures, and while I lay broken and bleeding on the deck, a man dressed in nothing but an open red robe, opened my mouth, and cut his own throat, spewing every drop of blood in his body down my gullet.  It took me another three years, but I was able to compel the rest of the Sani Sabik to believe that I was their rightful leader.
