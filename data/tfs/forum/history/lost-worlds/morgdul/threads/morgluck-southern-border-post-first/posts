By the simple virtue that it serves as the south's first point of contact with Morgdul, the town contains most of the Lightning Kingdom's population at nearly two thousand aspiring settlers. The people here, unlike in Kormdul, come from all backgrounds and have many differing perspectives on life. Owing to its swift rate of expansion, Morgluck is not endowed with the same city planning that grace Kormdul and Varnkorm, but in spite of this hardship the town remains fairly organized, with clearly-determined zoning districts.This is the gate on the south end of the town, where Morgdul's newcomers arrive. It is staffed by two Undying guards, warriors who have pledged life service to Morgdun.The border is currently open only to emissaries of foreign governments and citizens of Morgdul.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Morgluck is a logging town located on the southern border of Morgdul.
