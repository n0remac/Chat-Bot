Goods that are meant for trade will be processed in the customs house to ensure quality, keep inventory, and provide currency exchange services. The warehouses are open for use by anyone docked at Kormdul.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "A collection of four piers, as many dockyard warehouses, and a marble customs house makes the port districts of Kormdul, the settlement cheerfully dubbed the \"northern death.\""}}
