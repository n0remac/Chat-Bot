At best, a main road runs through town, flanked by the larger buildings, with alleyways in between them.

Along one of the long edges of the town's perimeter is the coastline, and thus the piers and their warehouses. Owing to the small population of Kormdul, the streets are often empty, but every face encountered in these roads is a familiar one.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "There is not much to be said for the streets that are laid out in this tiny village.
