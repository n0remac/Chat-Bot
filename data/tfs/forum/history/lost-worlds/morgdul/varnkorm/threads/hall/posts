Few from the common ranks have entered this place and laid their eyes upon this deep recess. Set low into the ground as it is, its high-vaulted ceilings are still far below the ground level, and side chambers extend deeper still from the hall.Light does not penetrate the surface to this strange place, and as such light is provided by self-radiating stones placed into the walls, ceiling, and floors. Though the multiple sources of light would throw off a normal human's awareness, only the Immortals frequently experience the room, and feel no adverse effects from the stones.There is no throne in the hall, as Morgdun is no petty king. There is a stone table in the center of the room, capable of creating light-based projections and illusions at will, so that he may commune with his Immortals across the realm. When he is not conducting business on the surface, he stands at this table in communion with his most loyal servants.To entertain foreign dignitaries, on the surface above the hall is a banquet room where Morgdun can properly showcase his self-worth according to the metrics of the world around him, rather than himself.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "This is a chamber known only as \"the hall,\" set deep below the ground in the northwestern district.
