Upon passing through the gate, one must journey through a short tunnel to reach the vaulted ceilings and open spaces within the fortress. Inside this tunnel is a door leading left to the citizenship office and a door leading right to access the wall's interior for defense purposes.The portal itself is rather small, capable of only allowing medium-sized carts or wagons through. Indeed, rather than a conventional gate, it is a thick door constructed of the same metal as the rest of the city. With this door being the sole method of entry, it is impossible to slip into the city unnoticed or force one's way into the fortress.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The brazen city-fortress of Varnkorm is accessible through one gate only, staffed by two lesser Immortals whose names are barely known to the world.
