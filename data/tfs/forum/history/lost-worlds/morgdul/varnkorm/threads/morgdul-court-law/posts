A spacious antechamber serves as a waiting room of sorts, with a clerk keeping sign-in records at a lectern. On the west wall of the room, the laws and codes of Morgdul have been displayed in masterful, ornate carving -- in reality, the physical evidence of an Immortal's powers over stone. Behind this antechamber is the true courtroom, with Immortal Arthelom presiding. Behind that is Varnkorm's prison, a truly inescapable artifice created by teams of Immortals at the personal direction of Morgdun.If one should find oneself at trial within these halls of justice, one is best-off praying for mercy from all the gods of the Overworld.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Housed within a massive property in the northwestern district of the city, concealed behind a grand facade, this is the Court of Law, with jurisdiction over the entire Dominion of Morgdul.
