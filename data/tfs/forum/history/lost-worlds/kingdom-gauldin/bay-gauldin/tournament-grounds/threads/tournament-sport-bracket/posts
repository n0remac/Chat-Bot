Large circular clearings surrounded by stands to hold the various people who will be observing the fights to come. The ground of the arena is dirt packed down hard and smooth and clear of any debris with a series of circles, with a diameter of twenty feet, marked off chalk lines indicating this is where participants are to fight. There are two black chalk lines surrounding center ring about five apart denoting where contests are to start.This is the Sport Arena denoted by the blue banners flying around the perimeter. To one side is a viewing area where participants can view the prizes to remind themselves what they are fighting for besides glory. The viewing area is surrounded by wards and guards so it is unlikely, indeed nearly impossible to dream of stealing the prize before the competition.Inside is, of course, three chests filled with large sums of gold. These take-up space around the true prizes.The trophy that will be rewarded to the person with the most victories is a silver blade when the tournament is completed the blade will have their name emblazoned on it to commemorate their victory for all time. It sits in a prominent position in a display case.The Cieltherium ring that will be awarded to the winner sits on a cushion on top of raised pedestal next to the silver blade. It pulses with a palpable magical power.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://orig08.deviantart.net/02c5/f/2007/165/1/6/medieval_banner_by_dragonsoulj.png", "http://img14.deviantart.net/58fe/i/2011/277/6/f/arena_by_ravenseye1113-d4bu6dg.jpg", "http://orig08.deviantart.net/02c5/f/2007/165/1/6/medieval_banner_by_dragonsoulj.png", "https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/e4/e6/a0/e4e6a0f90aa73a8772183f48554d9141.jpg", "https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/7b/d4/63/7bd463fd443eb3d3f2d422ad845c7c16.jpg", "https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/2c/28/02/2c280227eec48ddf286c06a8c125470c.jpg"], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><img alt=\" \" src=\"http://orig08.deviantart.net/02c5/f/2007/165/1/6/medieval_banner_by_dragonsoulj.png\" style=\"max-width:8%;\"/><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://img14.deviantart.net/58fe/i/2011/277/6/f/arena_by_ravenseye1113-d4bu6dg.jpg\" style=\"max-width:75%;\"/><img alt=\" \" src=\"http://orig08.deviantart.net/02c5/f/2007/165/1/6/medieval_banner_by_dragonsoulj.png\" style=\"max-width:8%;\"/></div>"}, "post-66150": {"user": "The Kingdom of Gauldin", "user_num": 882, "timestamp": "1494458224000", "message": "In Character Rules:Only swords are allowed in the sport bracket, the total length of the weapon cannot exceed one and a half meters or fall below forty centimeters.
