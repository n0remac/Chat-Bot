Yet they were still, in a sense, tangled. Raoul refused to let go of the hilt of the wakizashi, which Kuro was also wrestling for. That right arm reaching before Raoul's chest by their positioning lowered in a low forearm block to Raoul's groin kick. A couple layers of fabric formed a good defensive brace, but with Raoul's armor, the impact would be plenty painful beneath the fabric, most likely causing a bruise.Yet with Raoul falling, Kuro's hand still upon his own sword, and his stance having stabilized after the throw given years of jujutsu practice, the opponent's grip upon his hilt was likely to be weaker given all the forces combined. To capitalize on this advantage, Kuro did not take the fight to the ground as many of his instincts suggested, but stepped back and away from his opponent, adding more force to wrench the weapon free and allow him to disentangle from Raoul.Kuro, if his swift motions were not in some way counteracted, would not have the luxury of inflicting damage on his opponent just yet. In that regard, he had been slacking thus far. Raoul would also be given time to stand up again, a sacrifice he had made to retain control of his weapon.", "link_list": ["/user/2168"], "image_list": [], "html": "<span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-2168 group-0\" href=\"/user/2168\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@raoul\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Raoul Ferdinand</span></a></span>"}, "post-69976": {"user": "Raoul Ferdinand", "user_num": 2168, "timestamp": "1498531836000", "message": "Raoul rolled to his feet, yanking out his sword in an upward slash, just in case Kuro Issen  decided he was going to rush in.

So while the crowd cheered during their scuffle, it had been much harder than it looked to keep up with the armored man. Raoul Ferdinand was up in a heartbeat, sword drawn, its edge scraping against the inside of its scabbard and threatening a whip-like blow upon its exit, denying Kuro a quick and easy win. Instead, he was forced to wait for Raoul's sword to finish its arc and ready itself however it may.
