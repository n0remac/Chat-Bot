She was finally here. \u00a0Both brackets had treasures she absolutely needed and nothing was going to stop her. \u00a0Although she was secretly nervous to have so many people looking down to her in the arena, the casual air made her a little more relaxed knowing what she did didn't matter as much as in the main bracket. Rather than taking an actual fencing stance, she decided to play it loose. With a twirl of her left hand, she pulled the rapier free from its sheathe and wiggled the tip out in front. At the same time she ripped the main gauche from its belt and held it in her right hand. Her knees were belt slightly and overall looked like someone who was merely pretending to get into a fencing stance.\"Well, if this is just for shits and giggles then I might as well not go all out, right?\" She mentioned to Raoul, a smug grin and half-open eyes lazily staring down the armored man.\"En Garde, big guy.\"(Defense against your proposed attack)gcD77i3F1-20(Attack, but disregard since I'm not attacking yet)1-201-20\u00b71-20", "link_list": ["/user/2168"], "image_list": [], "html": "\"So this is the sports bracket, huh?\""}, "post-68344": {"user": "Raoul Ferdinand", "user_num": 2168, "timestamp": "1495988266000", "message": "(Using the rolls from the post I put in the apparently wrong place to describe the initial exchange.)Raoul stepped forward, tossing out a quick slash with an upward flick of the wrist, followed by a backhand cut towards @banditkelly \u2019s face.
