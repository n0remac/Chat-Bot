It was a technique Fenris would be familiar with for sure, as Lamina used it fairly often.  More evidence that Kelly had faked her competence during their previous battle.  Before he could finish his guffaw, Kelly immediately extended forward by spreading her legs and lunging, nearly doubling her reach and easily closing the distance she had made between the two. Her left foot extended and bent in front of her, her left arm fully stretched out and aimed a couple of degrees upward, her right foot touching the ground only by her bent toes, her motion was near-instant upon hopping back, almost as if the movement was otherworldly.  Fenris' parry was all for naught as with a quick flick of her wrist the rapier was loosened from the parry and once again directed forward, this time the tip of the blade angled upwards towards Fenris' exposed neck.  Although he would not have enough time to move the sword to his shoulder and fully out of her way, by ducking down so low she was bypassing his defeneses from beneath and striking upwards.

In her sudden aggression she might have miscalculated the timing as his guffaw happened after his blade had entered into its position over his shoulder. There was also the fact that despite her swift speed she still had to make up the timing from her retreat. Even so, she was pressing his defense. The only way to make up for her sudden quickness was economy of motion, and sacrafice. His right hand which had been moving to grasp the pommel instead saw his forearm move with graceful almost precognitive swiftness to intercept the rapier from beside it. She had scored her hit, but even a sharpened-edge rapier was not particularly good at  cutting especially if it was unintended. If nothing else, he wanted to avoid the hypothetical \"killing\" blow. Exchanging it for a less \"lethal\" blow. His forearm would would come across from his left to right to divert her thrust, perhaps drawing blood despite the wards, as his laughter abruptly became a feral-snarl.

He would seek to bound past her swords reach in the timing of his arms-parry, and even as he blocked her sword, he brought his own to bear. Truth be told as a fencer he might be something of an amateur, but his experience as a warrior showed him paths that were sometimes unthinkable to a duelist. But still, his skill as a fencer was brought to bare as his blade was brought down in a decisive diagonal slash from over his right shoulder seeking to move with the force of his forward momentum and striking as her sword was diverted off course. It sought to slash across her left shoulder and down her hip, for a good draw-cut. Regardless of success or not the blades path if not somehow impeded would carry it to rear back towards his lower left and pointing behind him, while he sustained that momentum and sought to continue to lower his body, as his right arm remained free and tucked to his side, while he potentially (and very likely) took things to up close and personal, since that seemed to be what she wanted.

To any normal individual it would be enough to throw them off balance as he shifted his weight out of the dagger's reach.At least, that's what he would assume.  The dagger was a ploy- setting him up exactly where she needed him.  A close-ranged fight was suicide for Kelly, merely because of the size difference.  And yet she had decided to get so close.  Her demented eyes would suggest she was clearly insane, and Fenris had every right to believe so.  The quiet, if snarky, women from before was replaced with what could only be described with a murderer, crazed for her next kill.  He wasn't intimidated by her.  She knew that.  She wasn't trying to.  Kelly had to rely on deception to get what she wanted, and if intimidation doesn't work then the other tactic is misdirection. Kelly didn't seem hindered by her arm being grappled, mainly because her arm was slightly bent to begin with.  In the same instance Fenris' \"First Contact\", she had ducked down and thrown her rapier arm (the left one) high into the air.  Doing so wouldn't move Fenris' arms entirely out of the way, but would give her enough time to stoop under the sword before it could come close enough to cut her throat.  His \"second contact\" would fail because of a misalignment in the advance and Fenris would have no time for the \"Third Contact\".However, as is par for the course by now, Kelly's movements were not limited just to this one move.  At the same moment she ducked down, she had shifted her left foot outside to keep Fenris from advancing on her flank.  It would be enough to match his movement for sure, but Fenris' grip on her arm surely kept her from moving more than a few inches lest she accidentally put herself in an armlock.  Fenris could tell she knew that, but the woman's thoughts were practically chaotic.  Ironically for the wolf-named wild-man man, Kelly was acting on animalistic nature that mirrored his cold-calculated strikes.  It was safe to say she had no idea what she was doing.Which led into the third part, the part that would be seen as the most outrageous and unexpected.  While the drawing of the dagger was a ploy to get both hands onto Kelly's arm, Fenris would learn that the left-handed bandit (matching his own dominate digits) was actually ambidextrous.  She didn't aim high above (blocked by Kelly's arm partly) or to the side (too far away from fenris' body even with her shifting to her left to match his).  No, she aimed for the one place no one would have the audacity to go.  During her movement- the ducking down, the slight shift to the side to stay in pace with Fenris- Kelly aimed to strike Fenris' crotch area with a direct and swift stab.

With her body so low, and her left leg sliding out to trip him up, she may have unknowingly compromised her balance, and the bend of her knees would impede her ability to extend her leg out. The Duck down would not save her the draw-cut, as since he was already grabbing her arm and so close, the blade simply \"followed\" downward till it reached her neck, following its original  diagonal trajectory till it reached the resistance of her throat. He was also lowering his body as well though obviously not as much as her. The attack had not been at an horizontal angle to duck to begin with, as it had originally and always been diagonal, so the momentum would not carry it over her head, as it had always been on its way down, and had been striking at such close range since it had been striking from the distance of their previous close-quarters bind. She did throw off the hilt-strike however, but her own movement would work against her as well.As she sought to cut off his attempt to flank, she would instead present herself to his bodies momentum, while she sought to extend her left-leg, the \"insistance\" of his strength would inflict a counter-balance.

His blade blade tilted afterwards for a quick diagonal rising swipe at her body from below from his right to left, while his right hand moved to unsheathed his short-sword, a \"Langes-Messer\" It was also worth noting the slam-down was from particularly and considerably close to the ground already, lessening her chance of a recovery, while this also did not clear the distance between them all that much as well, still not bringing her into the \"proper\" range of her rapier.

As such when she got to her feet to face him she didn't seem surprised that he had already planted his sword on her chest and was ready to strike.  His stance, his positioning of his swords, they were all designed to keep Kelly from attacking with her rapier.  He was too far away to stab without being stabbed herself and so much as raising her dagger when in the position would get her impaled through the chest or slashed from her left side.  It was a tricky spot to be sure for someone that relied on fencing.Luckily for her, she didn't need to strike with her rapier.  Attacking forward was suicide, she couldn't thrust from below like before, and attempting to move the sword would only bring the other on top of him.  Which is exactly why Kelly would attack from the side.In the blink of an eye, Kelly shifted to her right side (on the left side of Fenris' outstretched sword) and moved around the forte of the krieg-messer until she was on its left side.  The movement was fast- comparable to a mantis going for its prey.  It was swift and and abrupt, as if Kelly was made of air.  She had stepped past the blade, moved her rapier hand under Fenris' left arm until it was next to her and on the outside of his reach, let go of the rapier to let it fall to the ground with a sounding clank, grabbed Fenris' knuckled grip on his sword, and delivered a stab to his armpit with her dagger (which was now free to advance on him).  All in one deft movement that mimicked not the fencing techniques of nobility but defensive techniques taught by monks or martial artists.  By removing her rapier she had chosen to disarm herself in the hopes of grabbing Fenris' own hand to disarm him.  Her grip wasn't bone-crushing but something unusual- it seemed to control his wrist.  A tight grip to be sure, Kelly's own hand seemed to be turning Fenris' hand at a counter clockwise degree, turning his palm to face him.The jab at his shoulder blade was more akin to a lightning bolt striking the ground.  If anything the size difference only helped her as otherwise she would've had to aim for his head, but with her being so short she was able to close the gap and jab at his left armpit with a swift strike and pull-back in the same motion.  Fenris' casual stance and bent elbow would only mean less distance for her to cover and by placing her left hand on Fenris' own she had more room to advance on him.", "link_list": ["/user/168"], "image_list": [], "html": "(He responded and as such I will as well)"}, "post-69749": {"user": "Fenris", "user_num": 168, "timestamp": "1498009647000", "message": "Kelly The Bandit Despite the point which had struck her.

But even so, her movement would prove risky to say the least and she knew it, it was one last gamble it seemed. He matched her intensity though his presence was \"colder\" than her own. Not as passionate. This fight meant something different for him. He saw her intent but his blade had been left in a deliberate position to maximize its \"freedom\". He made no mistake though. Kelly was dangerous .As fast as her bodies movement was, his blades would prove faster still, as the movement of a blade was simpler and generally quicker. and his weapon was positioned to do just about any maneuver. His left wrist tilted to align his edge towards the blade angling towards the ground at a slant, suddenly leaving it in her path as she closed in. His blade itself shifted out to his left side as it seamlessly continued its dropping motion only to rise suddenly into an ascending diagonal cut at her inner left thigh. This would happen as his right leg slid forward suddenly with his previous momentum, and his left-boot kicked off the ground suddenly passing her left flank even as she sought to flank his own left.He leaned to his right in the motion to gain a bit more distance from her, as his arm dropped which would incidentally allow the limb to evade her grappling attempt if it still came, but the reach of his blade would ensure the strike would hit before she reached him, with her essentially moving into it. He would also be moving past the opposite side of her knife-hand as well, and gaining distance from it during the pass while making an attempt to hit awkward. Using her attempt to flank to pass her in turn and hopefully score a 2nd contact. It was essential to know that her speed did in fact matter, he simply used it to his advantage by moving opposite and letting the direction of her movement do the rest of the work for him, while attacking from an advantageous position.It was ideally one of those \"classic-finishes\" that one might have heard of, two sword-fighters charging, and passing each other, and in this case one cutting the other during the pass while evading reprisal. His movement carrying him a bit past her forsaken rapier, where he promptly turned his head to look at his left shoulder almost behind him, his body turning slightly to adjust back into a narrow left-leading stance. Daring her to try and reclaim her weapon. His left blade promptly pointing forward and extending to full length along his outstretched arm. His right weapon reared back.

Strike or not strike, Kelly wasn't going to let Fenris away that easily. As Kelly shifted, Fenris' blade had slid off her half-plate, giving her enough time to move into position. Even with his shift away from her right-handed jab, her left hand was still poised to grapple Fenris' left wrist. Moving up, down, away, closer, it made no difference- her hand honed in on it just as easily. Before being given a chance to move away, Kelly risked herself again and dropped her dagger to double up on her grapple on Fenris' arm. Regardless of its position, she pulled herself close to Fenris so that the wrist was held and twisted upwards by her left hand and the elbow was kept straight and locked with her right. Any movement would cause Fenris pain as she would simply twist it to give her leverage. He would find himself unable to strike with his right sword should he attempt at all.Now she was just being stubborn. Had this been a real fight @banditkelly would already have been killed from the throat-cut. The rules of the tourney were starting to work against him it seemed, he was a professional killer, a marauder, not whatever this was. This was not his scene, and it showed. He began to question the wisdom in joining in the first place. Then again perhaps there had been more to his reasoning than he had said. There was something in her response that felt vaguely automatic however. Somehow \"No matter how he moved\", she was going to get his arm anyway. Was there some kind of magic at work here? He did not even bother wondering how she avoided the cut to her inner-thigh, perhaps the chaotic-fate of the fight had favored her in that regard. Winning this encounter obviously meant a lot more to her than it did to him. But he was not going to let himself be defeated for anothers sense of validation. Even if he kind of wanted too; given how persistent she was being. He continued his evasion just enough to cause her to over-extend into her mad-dash for his arm low arm. She was so intent on grabbing and succeeding she was discounting his possible responses, and his positioning. His arm had swung and apparently missed causing it to cross over his body, as she \"homed\" in on him from his flank. She was following the path he laid out for her by grabbing his wrist \"no matter what\", because if she intended to grab it no matter what, he would make sure she did so on his terms. He rose a bit out of his crouch as she approached bringing more of his height to bear.  As stated that she would grab his arm no matter what position it moved too, and no matter what he did, she would have to play according to the positioning he had achieved. Which would cause her to reach and extend her body across his own in her attempt to grasp at his wrist. His height played to his advantage and he lowered his right arm, still holding the sword to put her in a headlock by chambering his arm around her throat and hugging her close to his ribs. This was possible because according to the positioning of his arm, in order to reach it from her own position she would have to lean across Fenris' body at a low-angle. An angle that saw his right-arm able to put her in his own \"move\" so to speak albeit it was far less elegant. He turned his hip left at the last moment, just as she grabbed his arm, which was not as helpless as she hoped as its positioning would also make it hard to lift since it was chambered and close to his body. In other words, in order to reach his wrist she would have to subject herself to the head-lock. In a positioning that would make it hard for her to lift his arm given how he his stance was considerably narrow, and his left arm was under his right. But a fleeting instant after the head-lock came he fell backwards towards his right intending to drive her face into the ground of the arena as he threw himself onto his side. Fully intending to keep the lock upon landing, in case this still wasn't enough.
