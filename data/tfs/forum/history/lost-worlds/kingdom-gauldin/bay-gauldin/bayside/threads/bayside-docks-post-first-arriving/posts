As such its docks districts is a long sprawling mess and where most travelers wind up when they come to visit the country. Just like the rest of Bayside, the docks become more reputable the closer you are to the Royal Road and the bridge leading to Travere. That means that you will find a well-ordered port in the middle and less savory berths at either end of the shore, with laxer officials perhaps.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://img02.deviantart.net/17d8/i/2013/010/b/b/bridge_city_island_by_klauspillon-d5r10j1.jpg"], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><img alt=\" \" src=\"http://img02.deviantart.net/17d8/i/2013/010/b/b/bridge_city_island_by_klauspillon-d5r10j1.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/></div>"}, "post-66376": {"user": "Chance", "user_num": 149, "timestamp": "1494651697000", "message": "\"Whhoooooo,\" Went the wind.
