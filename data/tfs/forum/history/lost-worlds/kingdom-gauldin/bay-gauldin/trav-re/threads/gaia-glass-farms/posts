They consist of capsules of glass suspended in the water that allow sea water to evaporate into the chamber. Once evaporated the water will condense and then drip down into the sections containing the soil and seedlings. The capsules are kept close to the ocean surface to allow enough sunlight to access the plant.These farms function best with the assistance of magical wards, but they can also be run without magic.While still experimental, these farms present numerous advantages. Since Gauldin has exhausted most of their free space for farmland, these farms can be constructed in otherwise unused space. They are completely immune to pests and can function perfectly well in times of drought. For yet unknown reasons, the fruits and vegetables being grown in such a manner are actually larger and tastier than normal fruits and vegetables. The farms are evenly space and mostly transparent, so sunlight continues to reach into the water and fuel the local ecosystems unabated. They are expected to be a boon to Gauldin's economy.While constructed under the supervision of the Guardians of Gaia from the Land-Tiller's expanse, these farms are under complete ownership of the government of Gauldin.", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1742/gaia-water-farms", "/user/1532", "/user/1056"], "image_list": ["https://i.gyazo.com/3821231c39b893c04d2f67f8476a4407.png"], "html": "In light of the recent alliance between the Land-Tiller's State and Gauldin, the Guardians of Gaia have begun assisting the Gauldish government in the creation of sustainable underwater farms."}}
