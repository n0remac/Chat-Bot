The myriad of scents and sounds that floated in the air around him served as a decent distraction for the demon, he even stopped by a few food stands to sample what treats they had available. They weren't magnificent certainly and normally he would smash through the counter in order to properly chastise the cook responsible but for some reason it just seemed to fit in this locale. There was some strange quality to the fair that simply made the food excusable...

Time for some real fun!\" he exclaimed before pulling ingredients out from a screaming vortex of fire, quickly bringing to bear all the necessary components. Within moments he had neatly arranged everything in a line on the stove's heat free zone with more than a few strange looking elements sticking out from the more conventional stock.The demon planned to make for the judges an old family recipe, passed down to himself from himself every few thousand years, something he liked to call 'The Aneurysm.'It began as always with a washing of his limbs followed by the first basic steps, the creation of the crust. Normally he'd use only the most high quality of ingredients... and this time was no exception! He was a flurry of movement, mixing the fine flour, crystal sugar, a wee bit of salt and cream butter together with iced water and kneading it into consistent doughy goodness. From there he carefully placed it in the tray so as not to tear it and delicately crimped the edge with his surprisingly gentle touch.As was customary for the expert chef; Maelik was busying his other prehensile limbs with the other portions of the glorious process of pie crafting. The clawed fingers of his wings were hard at work peeling the bizarre looking fruit that adorned his table and his tail was just as occupied with the task of scooping up globs of different jams and with expert precision evenly spreading it in layers atop the fresh dough.After four or so of the strange looking fruits were peeled Maelik would wash away the jam from his tail and thoroughly clean it, simultaneously blowing a single wisp of his demonic fire into the burner of the stove to preheat it. With that out of the way the former lord as ready to move on with the most crucial step (in his opinion) and conjured up a paper thin knife made out of what could only be described as nightmares given form. Maelik's hands were as steady as stone as he swiftly sliced the fruit into quarter centimeter strips and gingerly layered them on the jams in a stuttered X cross pattern until no jam could be seen through the multi-layered sheet. He would repeat the process, first the jam and then the fruit over and over again until the pie rose just half an inch short of the edges before putting it in his oven.In the length of time that it took for him to not only begin but also finish his baking just about ten minutes had passed, and Maelik held in his clutches his newest pride and joy.Made from a combination of cherry, strawberry, and raspberry jams as well as the strange demonic fruit that the demon brought with him (think somewhere between an apple and a blueberry that's the size of a pineapple) Maelik presents, 'THE ANEURYSM!!!\"He added the final touch, an inch thick application of whipped cream before placing his pie baby down on the tasting table with obvious pride.

The other is the one I have been thinking about recently. When we met, we were two people for whom time had stopped. Not in the literal sense, but rather we were both hurt so deeply it seemed pointless to go on. Yet we still did, we got up every day, and lived our dull shallow lives. Our minds constantly dwelling on what he lost. We couldn't bring ourselves to quit, we are survivors, but neither were we truly happy. I personally chose to live in a daze. I tackled every topic that took my whimsy, I acted like an addle brained imbecile, anything to avoid facing my despair.\"Again he shifts uncomfortably.\"As you are aware thing have changed for me. I got my son back, time has started back up for me. I have hope again, hope that I can live, not just exist. As you are aware Gavin has said some rather, odd things regarding our relationship. As a result of those things, I have taken some time to examine my emotions. Emotions which I either ignored, or was oblivious to previously. This will be hard to say, and I suspect it will be hard for you to hear. I originally planned to wait, I've took substantial time to mull this over, and I hoped to give you the same benefit. I think now though, this was not the best choice.\"Edward, looks from side to side, and adjusts his glasses.\"The inherent question I faced, was whether I had a desire to... Court you, only because I want Gavin to have a mother. If that was the case I would never attempt it. You are my friend, and that would be a terrible thing to do to you. So while I made my glasses, I thought about it long and hard. Benefit of time magic, a single night to you was several days to me. Reu, I didn't invite you to join into the ritual. At the time, I told myself that it was because I had more than enough power to complete it. Here is the thing though, if it had failed I would have unraveled. Literally I would have ceased to be, I am held together by will power alone, literally. If I lost hope again, I wouldn't have been able to take it.\"Another bout of awkwardness, this next part was going to be the hardest.\"I didn't acknowledge it at the time, but the real reason I didn't invite you, was because I didn't want you to see that. I didn't want to add that to your pain. With the benefit of hindsight, it is obvious that you would have rather been there. Finding out second hand what happened, would have been far worse. Still people tend to do irrational things when they are in love.\" He let's that hang for just a moment. Before she can respond he pushes ahead.\"I know that is probably not something you want to hear from me. I cannot pin point exactly when it happened, time magic makes such things blurry. You are kind, loving, compassionate, and you give so freely of yourself. You carry your pain, without letting it make you bitter, you try to greet those you meet with a smile, so as to not burden them. You are among the best people I have ever known, and I do not say that lightly.\"Edward lets out a long slow sigh.\"I do not need an answer. Not now, not ever, even if I may want one. If it is easiest for you, we can pretend it never happened. I will eventually move out with Gavin, and though you can continue to see him, I will try to avoid you. If you think we can still be friends, I would like to help you move on anyway I can. You deserve what I have, you deserve to live, not just exist.

Had she trusted him enough to open up and spill the story of her capture, her abuse, her violation, and the kind-hearted monk who had bandaged the wounds of her heart and soul?

A slender hand with glinting silver rings reached out, the tips of her fingers touching the underside of his chin and tilting his face up, bringing his blue eyes to meet her violet ones. They shifted with tumultuous emotions, constantly fluctuating between hope, fear, affection, and uncertainty, all under a glassy sheen of tears that refused to fall. She opened her mouth to speak, but nothing came out; so she closed it, took a deep breath, and tried again, a voice thick with emotion slowly tumbling out.\"..A man once said to me that he could see the pain I had suffered the first time he saw me, even from a distance, and that beneath it there lay a heart which wanted no love, refused to even consider it, and yet needed it all the more for those very reasons.

Not anymore.

But I once said the same thing to a man who cared little for such protestations, and pursued me anyway. Perhaps there is a lesson to be learned from that.\" She hesitated, swallowed with some difficulty, and then continued, clearly hesitant and unsure of herself. \"..If you wish to court me, I will not stop you.
