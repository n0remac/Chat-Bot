To me summoning is the act of careful preparation and study in order to subjugate a being from another plane.\"The demon seemed to struggle for words on how to continue for a few seconds, trying his best to use the right words for the situation.\"How can I explain this...? It's a battle of wills. The entity that your invoking is rarely going to be pleased that you've called captured it within some silly circle and the only thing preventing it from attack you is your force of will. If the creature can convince you to slip up or otherwise find a way to overcome your control of it then generally the summoner will wind up either injured or dead. Summoning circles and secondary precautions can serve as another layer of protection when dealing with especially volatile or wily beings but in the end it all boils down to one thing.

You should be paying attention, and participating. Someone has payed quite a bit of money for you to be here. You shame them by not taking full advantage.\"Reprimand delivered, Shyla looks down at the class roster. After some searching she finds a name, and marks something down. She then looks for another name.\"Mr. Fellblade is it? Thank you. You have provided a unique point of view on the summoning process. One the other students would do well to note. You have outlined one of the dangers of summoning. However, none of you have actually identified what summoning is. The issue is that, you are all looking at the process as a whole. Summoning is two separate processes. First there is the actual summoning of the creature. Then, as Mr. Fellblade noted, there is the actual binding of it, to your will.\"Shyla pauses to take a breath.\"To understand summoning, you must first understanding this: there are an infinite number of alternate planes. These planes, dimensions, or realities, are separated by a void. I will not try to explain what this void is. It suffices to say that it is comprised of nothing, and trying to understand it has driven many mad. Under normal circumstances traversing this void is impossible. The void is eminently hostile, to all but the most terrifyingly powerful beings. However, through use of magic bridges can be created. These bridges provide a safe passageway from one plane to another. The first part of any summoning ritual, is the creation of such a bridge. This is also why summoning is a prerequisite for the advanced class, inter-dimensional magics. The principles of creating portals for yourself, are similar to creating to them for others.\"Shyla pauses to allow students to catch up with their notes.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Shyla pulls a piece of chalk from her pouch, and flings it at Lucinda.

This is split into two parts, known most commonly as: the call, and the will. The call, is how you entice the creature to cross the bridge you created. This can take the form of: using a peculiarly name, having certain offerings, burning certain incenses, and many others. The will, is of course where you exert your will over the creature. Depending on the creature in question this can involve: a pure battle of wills, such as Mr. Fellblade discussed, striking a bargain, casting certain spells, and again many others. I will note at this point, that the most potent option is the formation of a contract. Contracts are strictly forbidden until third year, please remember this.
