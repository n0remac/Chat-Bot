Now, however, he was so confused...he reached for another piece of chocolate, as he always did when he was scared/confused/worried. As he lifted it to his mouth, he caught another whiff of the intoxicating scent. Suddenly, a light flicks on in his brain.\"Wait! Vera, I think these chocolates are a little...strange...And I'm not leaving.\"He claps a hand over his mouth as the last statement slips out. Why did he say that? What would have ever possessed him to say that? And why was it suddenly so warm in here? He was a vampire, he wasn't supposed to get warm.\"Uncle Renalt doesn't usually pack his chocolates in pink boxes...\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"Heh?\""}, "post-34971": {"user": "Vera of the Celadine", "user_num": 1050, "timestamp": "1461646634000", "message": "The chocolates!

He'd never thought it would come to this point, although he was definitely glad it had. He'd have to thank Uncle Renalt. Absently, he turns and glances towards that pink box.
