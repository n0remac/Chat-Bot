Perhaps she looked a beautiful bride, but she didn't feel it. Of course, that could have also been an enchantment.

Thousands and thousands of the city's people had come to even just get a glimpse, and they called and sang and threw rice and rose petals at the carriage as it went past.

She could feel the Duchess' steely gaze on her shoulders. The woman was not Genevieve's own mother, and in fact, Genevieve was the bastard of the late Duke of Carmean. For the Duchess of Carmean, Genevieve was a thorn in her side, and she had visited Genevieve personally to tell her that she was not allowed to wear black to the baptism of her grandson, \"The Crown Prince of Gauldin.\" The Duchess was very possessive of her possessions. So Genevieve was in a dove grey gown that was tailored to her frame, almost borderline lavender. She wore a locket around her neck now that held Odette's picture within it. The blonde was pale, and she was thin now, an unhealthy weight. The woman looked as if she could break at any moment......

Coming out in droves just to catch the barest hint of their king, queen, and new prince, it was frankly ridiculous. He returns her smile with a strained one of his own. She knew him well enough to know that he tolerated this ridiculousness only.

Renaux's boredom only briefly allayed by examing Arianne's sister. He'd never met the woman and he was surprised at her appearance. He could sense some great tragedy had recently befallen her though he hadn't the faintest idea what it could be. Perhaps after the ceremony he and Arianne could sit down with her, offer her what assistance they may. To Genevieve's left stood Antain Renaux best friend, head bodyguard, and now godfather of his child. The veritable giant of a man didn't look bored and didn't wear his usual professional demeanor, mostly he just looked sick. Which given he'd just been named godfather of the most important baby in Gauldin was understandable. Finally, the ceremony is over and Renaux raises Voltaire up to the light. The crowd erupts into a cheer of \"LONG LIVE THE PRINCE, LONG LIVE THE KING, LONG LIVE THE QUEEN!\" repeated over and over again. Reanux turns to Arianne as he lowers Voltaire and gives her a relieved smile as he hands over their child. Then they begin the slow march out of the citadel and back to their carriage.
