They shared a light and quick conversation in Gauldish, the waiter leaning in to air-kiss both of Genevieve's cheeks just as she did him, and then led toward a table that seemed to be \"her\" table.The ambiance of this neighborhood and this cafe was that of an upper-class WORKING class, a merchant class, if you will. No one would look down at Bella for the work clothes she wore, but they might if it appeared to be poor clothes or very unclean. Still, the standard of behavior expected from this quarter was that of the far upper class quarters -- manners, above all else. Inside the cafe, things were decorated simply but tastefully, giving it a very \"lived in\" vibe. Everyone else within the cafe seemed relaxed, easy conversation flowing that did not stop at the appearance of Genevieve or Bella. Menus were handed over, and the waiter whisked off without taking their order.\"Mm, that is Jean-Michel,\" Genevieve said to Bella in Common again, her accent a little more evident now that she was in Travere. \"I come here often and I think he is off to get my drink without thinking to have taken your order,\" Genevieve said, a warm humor on her tone although she did not laugh.", "link_list": ["/user/2207"], "image_list": [], "html": "Genevieve walked with an easy gait beside "}, "post-66246": {"user": "Annabelle \"Bella\" Khorudan", "user_num": 2207, "timestamp": "1494519267000", "message": "Bella watched it all with a pleasant but slightly confused smile.
