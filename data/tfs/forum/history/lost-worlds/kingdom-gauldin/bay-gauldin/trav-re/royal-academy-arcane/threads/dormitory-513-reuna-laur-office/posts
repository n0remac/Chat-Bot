The handwriting was legible, though unusually rigid and straight, almost as if the author had never adapted a stylistic flair to her writing. Her words however were another matter.The book started with a preface:I dedicate this text to my dear professor. Life in this strange city hasn't been easy. The people can be xenophonic and judgmental, and the students are mostly upper class and snooty. However, you've always done your best to treat everyone with an equal amount of respect and kindness, and for that I thank you.The opening paragraph read like this.There are many questions concerning the use of temporal magic. It is said that one should never alter one's own timeline, and for the most part this is a tested and true statement. However, many other esoteric, untestable moral quandaries arise when one considers the ramifications of the existence of the human soul, as well as the celestial plane on a quantum level. This is a controversial matter which many do not wish to discuss, but I feel it is necessary to discuss how these moral implications would be approached by different cultures should the use of temporal magic ever become wide spread.Beneath this paragraph would be a little note. \"Be very careful who you show this to.\"The thesis would contain several chapters on the spiritual beliefs of many different people, from the Phoenix State to Atlanticus, to the orcs of the Nokari to Medan, and how temporal magic would be adopted by each of these cultures should it ever exist.The final chapter did not mention a specific culture, but it was heavily implied that the author was referring to her own beliefs.The single greatest moral quandary which could be created by the use of temporal magic is the supposed eradication of the soul from a timeline. There are many hidden tribes of people in the East which embrace the concept of reincarnation and the immutability of the soul. For them, souls leaving the physical realm cannot be touched, cannot be changed, and cannot be destroyed without the authority of the creator god. No magic may interfere with the soul's existence, and its journey from one life to the next is the most sacred rights protected by all divine laws. For this reason, one would suppose that time magic should be completely outlawed in these cultures, as anything that threatens the very existence of a soul should be met with the swiftest of censure.However, there exists yet another possibility which would depend largely on the true nature of the universe. If the existence of different timelines only permeated the mortal realm and not the spiritual realm, the immutable home of immutable souls, then it is quite possible that souls and divine beings exist outside of space-time, and that temporal magic would, in the worst case, only result in the supposed \"death\" of an individual erased from existence. The soul would simply exit the time-line, no different than any other death. Likewise, a soul that is created via a different time-line is simply being born.The reason why this is the most controversial of all scenarios is that the existence of souls outside normal time and space, combined with this belief in immutable souls and reincarnation, suggests that all of time and space as we know it is predestined, and that a soul enters life (or a timeline) knowing what it is going to experience. This actually fits in perfectly with the Eastern Tribes and their beliefs, for they believe that every lifetime is about experiencing life lessons and growing and developing. Thus there is no quandary. However, this may present grave problems for those of different spiritual inclinations, as has been discussed in previous chapters.At the bottom of this page is another note. \"Whatever you do, do not show anyone this page.\"Should Reuna continue to the end of the text, she would find one final note written in green ink:A-. As usual you demonstrate a sophisticated writing style, though I still advise you to watch the run-on sentences and always remember to maintain focus. You also need to address your habit of mixing up certain pronouns. It's unbecoming of someone your grade level. However, my gravest concern is that you are expressing beliefs which, while you are entitled to, also put you in danger from other students who's spiritual beliefs are much more zealous. Recently we've had students from the Phoenix State who are worshipers of Amun-Ra who, as you know, excel in their work, but are extremely arrogant.Just be careful.

This presented many ideas, but also raised many questions. The most prevalent was, of course, who or what had drawn her attention to this book? Reuna had a suspicion on that front, but of course, there was only one way to prove it. Or disprove it. Tapping the spine of the book idly against her shoulder, she raised her violet eyes to the surrounding room.<br><br/><font color=\"purple\">\"You know, I've met spirits in the past. Usually malevolent ones, but not always. Sometimes it's just the lingering essence of a person who wants to see their life's work completed... I can't tell if that's you, and if it is, if you just want to see your theories proven correct in the restoration of a mortal soul to a body, or if you know someone who this would apply to. Regardless, I have my suspicions, and if it's quite alright with you, I'm going to present this to someone who would benefit greatly from its knowledge.\"</font><br/><br/>She hesitated, wondering if she was just certifiably insane or if there actually <i>was</i> a spirit present. Either way, she continued, her voice softer and brimming with sadness. <font color=\"purple\">\"..If you meant for me to give this to him, I thank you. He's been through much, and at least one of us deserves a little happiness.\"</font> With that said, she removed the ward across her door and unlocked it, then stood. Almost anxiously, the sorceress tapped the book against her palm, before calling out to the resident time mage, <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-1028 group-0\" href=\"/user/1028\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@echo\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Prof. Edward \"Echoes\" Laur\u00e9nt</span></a></span>. <font color=\"purple\">\"Echoes?
