Arianne at least seemed to have a sense of humor and she had been willing to try and get along which was much better than he had hoped for.Renaux thinking on it further he realized that he wanted to do something nice for the lady to show his appreciation. However he was terrible at gifts. Oh he was sure there was a pile of them labeled as being from him for her and all chosen out by Gaspar. That though seemed insufficient, he needed something better. A long moment passes and slowly an idea forms, Renaux gets up dresses himself and goes to put his plan in motion. Around the time most people have finished their breakfasts and returned to their rooms Renaux once again approaches Ariannes door. He is in full military dress a half dozen medals on his left beast commending him for bravery and skill, his plain though enchanted bastard sword is buckled on his hip, and the intricate winged crown of the king on his brow. In short he looks far more regal than he did last night when he had been dressed casually. The only odd thing is the plain brown leather bag he carries in one hand.

Twined between the sweet, innocent but entirely alien words of the lamian woman and the music forged by her voice was lashing winds, sheeting rain and the throb of thunder. One half expected to look up and see dark clouds. It rose to a horrifying crescendo that was both a battle of giant proportions and the wrath of a storm god.

The clashing of storm was in some intrinsic way connected to this love, though any who heard it would remember nothing of the substance later.

Her face was rapturous with delight, eyes wide open and staring into the music, unseeing of the real world. As the music rose to a majestic, exultant crescendo, her eyes returned to Gaspar's eyes for the first time since she started singing and fixed him with an entrancing gaze. She rose without stopping until despair, storm and even though were drowned by her yearning sweetness lacing her music. Just when the emotion pouring forth from her could became overwhelming, the music peaked and her voice faded. The symphony and song, now married to each other sank into a warm well of eternity that could be touched long after Remelia had stopped slinging.Remelia blinked and pulled back, without realizing it she'd slithered to within a foot of Gaspard, entranced by her own music.

The only thing that seemed to be his was a small practical and neatly ordered desk in the far corner. Renaux suddenly realized something, here he was alone in his room with his wife on their wedding night. All of the calm confidence he had felt previously evaporates. His blush spreads past his cheeks and all the way down his neck, desperate to distract himself he throws his jacket onto a nearby chair and slumps onto one of the rooms couches.

Still, she must make sure not to alarm him and keep the talk of magic in plain terms.\u201cI wish to make a proposition to your majesty. Although not common knowledge, especially here in Gauldin, I am the founder of an organization known as The Black Tower. I founded this organization recently as a response you might say to all the terrible monsters and people that exist in this world. Violent dragons, sea monsters that sink whole fleets, vampires that abduct villages, murderous mages, the list goes on.\u201d\u201cThe goal of The Black Tower is to form a force that will bring down such creatures and people before they commit these atrocities, or at the very least prevent them from causing any more atrocities. However, unlike most, we wish to have international presence. We feel that regardless of where one lives, they shouldn\u2019t have to put up with such things. Nations cannot form such a force as it might be seen as an act of war if they sent such a force into neighboring lands, even if it was for a good purpose. However, we are no nation, simply an organization.\u201d\u201cNow, I shall get to what I request of your majesty. The Black Tower is currently headquartered just outside The Free City. We wish to expand to be better able to protect more people from such things. I ask that Gauldin would allow The Black Tower to form another branch here near the capital. Now, don\u2019t misunderstand me, I am well aware that Gauldin has a very capable army as well as many powerful mages. However, our organization could be of great help when faced with threats outside the ordinary. After all, it is what we specialize in bringing down.\u201d\u201cAs you saw just a few days ago, when the unexpected hits, it can hit very hard indeed. If you allowed us to set up in your city we would certainly be willing to work with your army and law enforcement in bringing down these monsters as well as sharing intelligence. I understand if you don\u2019t feel comfortable with such an agreement, but I do implore you to consider it.\u201dGrandma would wait to see the king's reaction before going into the specifics.

As said before, I lead all branches and what they do is under my authority. Each branch is to be lead by an Inspector who will run the day to day operations but also be capable of going out on local missions if needed. Each branch will also have standard personnel, builders, guards, servants, etc. Our main feature is our task force however. They are a group of people and creatures from various backgrounds that will enforce The Black Towers goal.\u201d\u201cWhen a problem arises, we will contact members of the task force who we deem capable of dealing with it and send them out. Of course, we won\u2019t have the personnel to deal with all types of problems such as more standard crimes, but our goal is to gain a force that deals with the more extreme situations. We also will attempt to avoid as much collateral damage as possible, which is why our intelligence department is so important, fighting some beast in the fields before it reaches the city can make a huge difference in the number of casualties caused by it.\u201d\u201cAs for what considerations we would need, well\u2026 Some of the towers methods might be unsettling and normally banned by law, although I cannot be certain of this as I do not know the exact laws of Gauldin in regards to magic usage. I will use this as an example, my apologies if this talk disturbs you, but I must do it for clarity. As you know, there are a number of magical creatures and even mages out there that are quite difficult to slay. You can stab them through the heart and remove their head, but then they simply escape as a spirit or regenerate themselves. Normal methods aren\u2019t effective on such creatures.\u201d\u201cTo defeat such monsters, we might have to steal its soul from its body and contain it in an artifact, use magic mages in gauldin would consider forbidden, or do away with the beast by calling down unsavory powers against it. However, although we use methods some might consider unethical or morally wrong, our goal in the end is to dispose of these beast in the fastest way possible so none in your kingdom will have to suffer at their hands. Although these methods might ruffle the feathers of some of your mages or priest, I believe the end justifies the means in this case.\u201d\u201cPlease also realize that although I speak of these less savory magics and methods, none of these would put bystanders in any more danger than standard methods. Infact, it would place them in less danger as the threats would be dealt with more swiftly. The main reason I bring this up is not so much to warn you of the dangers of the magic, simply to warn you of the stubborn people in your kingdom who might complain about such things.\u201d", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Grandma would nod and continue on, glad the king wanted to know more about it."}, "post-19539": {"user": "King Renaux of Trav\u00e9re", "user_num": 889, "timestamp": "1450877309000", "message": "The king leans back in his chair and takes a deep breath, his expression us carefully schooled to give nothing of his thoughts away.

Just because weak minded individuals may have cracked when using such magic does not mean it is inherently unsafe. However, to make things simpler, they have put blanket bans on certain types of magic. This is understandable, but it is not understandable to not make exceptions to this ban when there are those who can use such magics safely.\u201d\u201cI will say this about the magic the tower uses.

They hardly spoke, but for once a day when he came to visit her as if checking up on her or receiving a military report.\"Good evening, father,\" Arianne said, moving forward to kiss her father's cheek.

Manticores are the most misunderstood magical creatures in the wilds. They're predatory and teritorial, so people get in trouble a lot when they accidentally wander into one's hunting grounds or a manticore sets up shop near them, but I've seen their kinder, more intelligent side. Back when I was running from the Ivelian soldiers who were trying to kill me due to my magic affinity, I passed out due to exhaustion and hunger. As I heard the clatter of armour and the yells of troops, I thought I would be done for. The last thing I heard before blacking out was a loud, terrifying roar.\"When I woke up, I was in a cave of sorts, surrounded by the stench of death. All around me there were bones -- from deers to wolves, even some human bones. And before me, there lie a pile of raw meat. Deer haunches by the look of it, fresh and dripping with blood, torn by claw marks. I recoiled, and in scrambling back I inadvertently scattered a pile of bones. The clatter awakened something nearby, and from the darkness two slitted yellow eyes opened and peered at me, coming closer and closer.\"When I lit a magical flame and realised that it was a manticore, I was terrified. I thought it would spear me and eat me for dinner. Instead, it nudged the meat toward me and gave me an expectant look. It wanted me to eat. I was very confused. Over the next few weeks, though, the manticore and I grew to be close friends. I think that, for some reason, it thought of me as its child or something. This particular species of manticore did not have a human face, but a cat-like Visage with terrifyingly sharp canines and a vicious temper but...for some reason, it saved me. I eventually had to leave and move on, of course, but that's why I like manticores so much.\"She lays her head upon the Pegasus' wing, and strokes it lightly before saying, wistfully, \"They're just misunderstood.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Gwen also rises her head from where she leans upon the Pegasus and looks over to him with a bright smile."}, "post-28626": {"user": "King Renaux of Trav\u00e9re", "user_num": 889, "timestamp": "1457992245000", "message": "Echoes listens to the story, his eyes widening as she speaks.

As she does so, she sends a mental message to Reese, requesting him to keep an eye on the wing overnight, and warn them if anyone was coming.With that, she joins Naoki under the covers, scooting close enough to the other woman that they warm the same air space. With the bedlinens soft against her skin (one good thing about Gauldin, she muses), she drifts off to sleep.The warm sheets are gone. Cold steel against her back. Something hot running down her stomach. A coppery smell. Blood - her own. Sobs - not her own. She tries to move, and cannot. Her eyes dart to the left, in the direction of the sound. A pile of limbs and corpses. A young girl, in a bloodstained white shift, sitting in the middle of the pile, crying.The scene shifts. She\u2019s standing in the middle of a crowd, in a town square. In the distance, a burning building, impossibly large, fills the sky. Her eyes flit desperately from face to face around her. Condemnation. Pity. Revulsion. Lust. Hatred. Rage. Rough hands grab her shoulders. She screams, and pulls away, only to be grabbed again. Her fists fall impotently on her assailants. One of them grabs her shirt and tears violently. Coarse laughter, from male and female throats. One of the women pulls out a dagger, and slowly licks the blade. One of the men starts to pull down his pants, and she freezes. No, no, no, nonononono this can\u2019t be happening not again please God why NO PLEASE STOP NO!!She wakes with a start and a strangled cry, struggling briefly with tangled, sweat-soaked sheets. Her heart beats loud in her ears as she stares wide-eyed into the darkness. A dream, only a dream, but she is never quite able to convince herself of that until the morning comes. She closes her eyes again, and invisible attackers hover over the bed, ready to strike. Glowing blue searches the room, banishing the demons, only for them to return again when her eyes close.After a few more minutes, she can't take it any more. She shifts in the bed, bringing herself closer to Naoki, barely far enough away to not touch her. Eyes shut tight, she breathes in and out slowly, focusing on the other woman's scent, and tries to stop shaking.
