The aisle was marked by the smell of dust and old leather, and the floors were in dire need of a good sweeping. Oddly enough there was very little magic in this aisle. It was quite unremarkable, which if she were smart she would realize that this was precisely what made it so remarkable. Why would an ordinary, non-magical aisle be found in one of the greatest collections of magical tomes and texts in the known world?On the edge of the aisle would be found a pedestal with a bust on it. The bust would read:\"In memory of Professor Demos Thenes, may his obsession with collecting every useless thing his students ever wrote be put to good use in the afterlife.\"The books here had not been read in a very long time. Should Reuna bother to peruse them, she'd find that most of them were in relatively good condition and need not be touched.However, if she lingered in the aisle long enough, or perhaps just as she was about to leave, a single book from a high shelf would suddenly fling itself to the ground with a plop. This book did not fair as well as the others. In fact, if she saw which shelf it came from, she'd notice quite a few of the books on this shelf suffered from strange defects like burnt pages or water damage. Some of them had intact pages but badly damaged bindings and covers. Either they were burnt or rotted into near dust.It was up to her whether or not she wanted to repair them. They possessed very little if any magical energy.

I've heard rumors in many worlds of trees that are the font of mana within that plane, but I do not know if this world possesses one. And the feather of a ferryman...

He found he had to pay a fee to enter, which was not too bad, and once he walked into the library and saw how many books there were he knew his coin was well spent. It was perhaps the best purchase he had ever made.Blank would stand in the entrance gaping at the number of books in the library for a bit, unsure of where to start.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Blank would now find himself in The Grand Library of the magic academy of Gauldin.

Thank you Reuna,\" he said. Blank would waste no time as moments later he had already selected four books, each of them quite far away from each other in where they were situated on the shelves, and then taking the small stack to a table nearby. He would begin with a rather thick leather bound book that was dyed blue with somewhat faded gold lettering, it was titled, \"What is Magic? - An Exhaustive Analysis,\" by Archmage Declan Smalltree.Blank had read some books before, and was quite a fast reader, often being able to read a full page after just a few moments of looking it over. This book, however, was very heavy in advanced terminology that he had to process, and he would be a bit slower in the beginning. Towards the latter half of the book, however, he was flipping through the pages much quicker. All in all, he would only have to pour over this book for about a half hour before he reached the final page, and by that point, he already had a much greater understanding of magic and how it worked as he was able to perfectly memorize the contents of that last book. He would waste no time in moving on to the next book, and then the next one after that until he finished all four of them within the hour. The next three books dealt more so in the application of magic instead of the theory, which made them relatively light reads and much easier to understand for Blank after having read Archmage Declan's piece.\u00a0He would call over Reuna\u00a0at this point, \"I am finished with these, should I place them back on the shelf for you?

He found the symbols to be familiar, as he was quite well versed in the runic alphabet at this point. In fact, as he looked around he found familiar symbols everywhere, where previously only meaningless inscriptions were inscribed. This library was just full of magic, he realized. Seeing some of the applications of the runes also started giving him some ideas. What if he incorporated some of these useful things into his own apartment? The possibilities seemed endless.\u00a0First, however, he would have to learn magic. He had quite a good understanding of exactly how to go about this, should it be possible. First, he would have to find out if he was even capable of channeling mana, which could be accomplished in a couple of different ways. Once that was complete with hopefully favorable results, there was a number of ways to go about learning magic, though the methods used by those who self-taught were considerably more time consuming and tedious compared to methods used by those who receive assistance from magic users.These thought processes would eventually lead into him asking a question, \"Hey Reuna, are you able to use magic?\"It was a simple enough question, and depending on the answer he would lead into a few other branches of conversation that Blank had already plotted out within his mind, even if he had a good feeling he knew what the answer was already.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Blank watched the book fly off after Reuna\u00a0double tapped on the rune, and now his brows shot up in amazement.\u00a0"}, "post-55983": {"user": "Reuna Laur\u00e9nt", "user_num": 1020, "timestamp": "1479232107000", "message": "His reaction elicited a quiet chuckle from the woman, and then she simply stood there, watching him.
