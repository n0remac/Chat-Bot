This hallway leads to the main area, which is, while not the prime attraction of this business, at least a very large drawing point.In a direct contrast to the exterior and the foyer, the main bar and restaurant area of the lounge is filled with heavily-carved dark wood tables and chairs, private booth areas upholstered with rich velvet in a tantalizing scarlet hue, and lights just dim enough to give the room an intimate atmosphere that seem to be magically powered. There are intricate carvings, paintings, statues, and stuffed animal heads adorning the walls, and one wall is entirely taken up by a fully-stocked and expertly-staffed bar, which can provide veritably any drink the customer desires. In three of the four corners, there are spiral stairwells leading up to the second floor.A blend of the foyer and the main level, the second story of the building is filled with private booths upholstered in (magically protected) white silk and glass tables, all arranged around a large, sunken area that is clear of any obstruction, clearly intended for people to dance. Providing music to dance to, at the back of the (surprisingly large) area is a raised stage, whereupon a collection of musical instruments sits. Throughout the night, musicians play here, and the music is magically filtered down to the first floor, at a lower volume. More often than not, the establishment's owner, the mysterious and wily Fae, Morrigan da Silverlain, is seen taking the stage to sing for the pleasure of her clients.. and herself.The small third floor space, which is accessed by invitation only (except for the manager and head chef) contains the office of Morrigan.Drink MenuCOVENTRY RED: a smooth Merlot, tastes of strawberries and summer

It begins with mon-cher. \"I believe I owed you three bottle of unique liqueur. This is my first attempt at number three. I find it a bit dull, a bit run of the mill, but it is safe reliable and should serve well. I think if you do not want to push boundaries it is what you should serve.\"There is a break in the letter.

However, before Naoki has a chance to continue the conversation, Claude returns with their appetizers.After he places them down, Naoki responds, \u201cThank you, but we are not. Just a short while, if you would, please.\u201dSliding the pork balls to one side and the garlic bread to the other, Naoki moves her menu to the center of the table so that Liz ought to be able to see. Standing up out of her seat, Naoki leans forward to plant one palm on the table, and uses the other finger to point to the menu, \u201cThe title here, this reads, \u2018Main Courses\u2019.\u201d As she is, Naoki\u2019s chest hovers dangerously close to the pork balls, such so that if she leans forward anymore, she\u2019ll be getting sauce all over the front of her gown. As such, she is careful to not.Starting at the top of the list, Naoki traces her finger across the word TARTE and proceeds to explain to Liz what all the described meal entails, \u201cThis first item, this is like... Beets and, goat cheese in a pastry, and also a salad- doesn\u2019t sound very appealing to me. If you have a thing for beets, I suppose\u2026\u201d Moving onto the next item, she continues, \u201cThis is a zucchini and pea salad, also not really my speed. \u2026  This word here- 'poulet', that translates directly to 'chicken'. This dish is chicken, with mushrooms, vegetables and... mashed potatoes, it seems like. Sounds alright- maybe try that. Next, we have some duck, with\u2026 Uhm, sliced potatoes, and also beans.\u201dEvidently, Naoki is having a bit of trouble translating the Gauldish text of the menu faithfully, unable to quite articulate some of the intricacies of how each dish is cooked. It\u2019s one thing to understand, but entirely another to translate and articulate clearly, she's finding. \u201cAnd then some mussels. Steamed mussels, at that, with garlic. And then\u2026 more fish, this is a sort of seafood medley. And then, here we have some bass- as in the fish, also steamed, with olives, basil, and tomatoes\u2026\u201d Naoki trails off for a moment, considering the intricacies of the Sea Bass en Papillote. After a moment, she silently concludes that it sounds awful and that she wouldn\u2019t like any part of it. Continuing, \u201cBut oh- oh, here we go, this is says half chicken. \u2018Demi\u2019 is half, and \u2018poulet\u2019 is still chicken. It also says that it\u2019s marinated in spices. Sounds pretty good to me.\u201d \u201cAnd then lastly, this is just a fancy way to say beef bourguignon. That\u2019s- as you might expect, beef with all sorts of sauce and such on top- probably pretty good, I\u2019ve had that before elsewhere and liked it.\u201dAs that seems to be the end of the list of main dishes, Naoki takes the menu back into her hands for a closer inspection. \u201cThat\u2019s it for main courses, but they also have soups. \u2026 They actually have a quite a few kinds of soup- everything under \u2018Potage\u2019 is a soup. I can translate those as well if you\u2019d like, but it\u2019s looking like your safest bets as far as not-soup meals that will seem familiar are the Boulet Breton- the chicken with vegetables, the Demi Poulet- the half chicken, the beef bourguignon, or maybe one of the seafood dishes- if you like seafood. I think personally... I\u2019m probably going to go with theeee... half-chicken. What are you thinking, does anything here stand out, or should I tell you about the soups?\u201d With this, Naoki offers Liz a single raised eyebrow over the menu.

Nodding along in acknowledgment, she responds, \u201cIt\u2019s not something I make a habit of discussing, to be sure. It isn\u2019t a particularly pleasant topic, but if you\u2019d like to know, I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d Seamlessly, Naoki transitions from the spoken word to the telepathically transmitted, her earring beginning to glow as she addresses Liz silently, \u201cTo begin, I should first state explicitly that at the time of the first memories I have, I was not a young child, but rather one of perhaps twelve to fifteen years. Whether I existed before that point and was made to forget or not is a question that remains unanswered, despite my best efforts.\u201dEven though Naoki isn\u2019t speaking with her mouth, Naoki maintains steady eye contact with Liz as if she were, watching carefully to see how she reacts as she continues, \u201cRegardless, I found myself in an alleyway, without knowledge of the world or language, simply some rags. I was about as naive as it is possible to be and didn\u2019t know to be upset or try to resist when some men came along, tied me up, and took me away. It wasn\u2019t until later that I pieced together enough information to understand that the place that they took me was a brothel and that there was more to the world besides being kept there and made to please whatever they placed before me. As my understanding grew, so too did my dissatisfaction and my resentment. After tasting real food, I was no longer satisfied with the gruel I was served. After seeing the street outside, with people walking freely, I was no longer content to sit in my cage.\u201dExercising the freedom offered by having her mouth free, Naoki doesn\u2019t need to pause in her narrative to take a sip of wine as she continues, \u201cOver time, as I continued to accrue and parse information, I began to plot, plan, and develop ideas of my own. Escape was the first goal. In that regard, I did well. I began to take note of how the employees patrolled. Which doors were locked, and which guards were the most inept. I did attempt to escape on a few occasions but didn\u2019t get particularly far. There was only so much that I could do by myself, without anything else besides the rags on my back.\u201d\u201cFortunately enough for the pair of us, I met Artemis one day. She was in a similar position to my own but had not only knowledge of the outside world, but considerable physical abilities. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever seen her really let loose on anything, but take my word for it when I say that she is very adept at killing, to say the very least.\u201dAlmost idly, Naoki uses a toothpick to pick up one of the pork balls, pops it into her mouth, and chews quietly as she continues, \u201cTo leave out a number of details because we\u2019re eating, she and I escaped. However, this only marginally improved our status. It left us as two young women out in the world with nothing beyond the company of the other and the skills we had acquired working in the brothel. We turned those skills into food where we could and stole where we could not. In this manner, we eked out an existence as urchins. There was also a brief phase wherein I organized and lead a gang of sorts, but we quickly ran afoul of the local law and were forced to flee, becoming only a pair once more.\u201dDespite the unpleasant and probably painful memories Naoki is recounting, the 'inflection' of her telepathy does not waver, nor does her expression.

On one occasion, Artemis and I were visiting a bar- a real hole in the wall sort of place, just the sort of place where we might expect to scrape up some food money. As I was meandering about, acquainting myself with the place, this woman approached me. She was an old woman, maybe five foot five on a good day, wearing a ratty sort of black cloak. I learned later that she owned the place. But she looked at me- looked into me, looked through me. \u2026 And I suppose whatever she saw, she liked because she went ahead and offered me the establishment to run as my own.\u201dLeaning forward with arms crossed on the table, Naoki concludes, \u201cThat bar was The Midnight Sun, and the woman is known only as Grandma- you may have seen her around, she hasn\u2019t changed a bit.\u201d", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "As she listens to Liz\u2019 question, an expression of visible surprise registers on Naoki\u2019s face.
