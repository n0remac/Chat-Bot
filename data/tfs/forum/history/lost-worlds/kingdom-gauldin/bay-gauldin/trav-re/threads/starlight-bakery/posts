A set of steps out front is lined with flowers, ascending to a small gate with a sign that says, Bakers only! If one should happen to garner a peek inside, they would see a large room filled with tables, racks, and ovens. On the other side of the red-painted first floor door is a sight pleasing to both the eyes, the nose, and the palate.A bakery. But not just any bakery: A bakery so quaint, cozy, and generally pleasant that one feels right at home, taking a seat at the counter, on a chair, or in a plushly-padded booth. Glass-covered shelves run the length of the counter, displaying the many different types of goods available - breads, cookies, tarts, pastries, pies, cakes, cupcakes.. if it can be imagined, it can be seen on those shelves. Behind the counter are yet more shelves, filled with bags labeled with descriptions such as, Hot Cocoa, Mocha Cafe, Vanilla Bean, and many others - anyone who asks will happily be given a sample of one of the special drinks that can be made from the contents of these bags.Bustling around behind the counter and up-and-down the stairs to the second floor baking center can be seen the owner and baker extraordinaire, one Eleniel Windsong, a petite blonde-haired, grey-eyed Elf who is new to Trav\u00e9re. Always ready with a smile, a laugh, and a friendly word, she gladly serves anyone, regardless of race or creed. As long as they're not mean! (And she loves to give out free samples.
