Dismissing the flute with but a thought, her gaze drifted back to Ulfang, and she silently moved closer, pulling her diminutive form up onto the bed to perch beside him.

Ah, perhaps it would help if I told you I could relate, in a way.\"He crosses his own hands over his knee and sits upright as he prepares to tell the story. \"So our family, the Von Haren bloodline, is cursed. Every single one of our children born will inevitably develop nigh-uncontrollable powers of darkness and death during their tenth winter or thereabouts. Blood magic is not very accurate when it comes to time. Anyway, originally this was meant to be a punishment against our family. Deep in the annals of our family lies the story of Borin III Von Haren of Greenvale, a business-minded sort who swindled medical supplies from an old Pellar -- one who banishes evil spirits using certain rituals -- living deep in the woods. The Pellar, however, far from a pushover, was a practitioner of blood magic, one of the most insidious kinds. In some places, it is even forbidden to speak of it. If Borin had known this, no doubt he would never have done what he did, but...when you invoke the ire of a blood mage, there is no turning back.\"Ulfang pauses for a moment as he stands, moving over to where the glasses are kept to pour himself a glass of Medanese Gold. He continues as he pulls the cork off the bottle and begins to pour.\"To make a very long story much shorter, the blood mage cursed Borin, placing a stain upon our lineage. We would never find peace, he said, plagued by an inevitable manifestation of dangerous and blatantly dark magics,\" he says, finishing the pour and sitting back down next to Azure. He takes a sip before continuing, \"we would be persecuted. We would be hunted down by other Varan and our entire line exterminated. It did not turn out the way the blood mage intended, but it did change the way my house was perceived, and the way we operate, for all time.\"\"So all of our children are born this way. Let me tell you, the transition from being a normal child into one with the ability to absorb the very essence of another, to make the dead rise from the grave before one's very eyes...it is not easy. Many Von Haren children don't survive the event, accidentally creating an abomination that kills them on the spot, or hunted down for unintentionally taking the wrong soul. My mother and father were excellent teachers, but still. It changed so much. My very perception of the world was different. Things were no longer either good or bad. I was not a bad person, yet I did things that one would consider bad. It was...a dilemma. I could go deeper into this, but suffice to say, such a dramatic change in one's perceptions, in the very way the world feels ...it is not foreign to me,\" says Ulfang, falling silent with a light sigh.After several minutes, he speaks up again, much less solemn than before.\u00a0\"We will go to the Theatre, then, and then we will pick up something to eat.

To hear music for what it truly was, rather than simply detecting the vibrations in the water molecules in the air. To smell the fragrances of flowers, whose colors entranced her so. And perhaps, above all, to truly <i>feel</i> her emotions, rather than perceiving them through the haze that surrounded all her senses.<br/><br/>As her eyes opened, Azure gracefully unfolded herself from her spot on the floor, and moved silently over to the bed. She crawled onto it, the lack of true weight in her corporeal form not even causing the bed to shift. Her eyes gazed down at the sleeping visage of Ulfang, watching the subtle twitches of his muscles, hearing the steady inhale-exhale of his breathing, feeling the almost-imperceptible rhythm of his heartbeat. One hand lifted, reaching toward his face, but did not touch. She lightly traced a path through the air, mere inches above the arch of his brow, the curve of his cheek, the line of his jaw. What would it feel like, to repeat that movement with her hand actually touching his skin, and feel it beneath her fingertips?<br/><br/>There came again that sense of warmth, and the pleasant-yet-strange outward-pushing pressure. Her lips curved upward into a smile, and without a sound, her corporeal form dissipated. Her consciousness remained tethered near the Jewel, hovering just above Ulfang's body, while her senses spread throughout the room. He would still be well-protected, but she would be able to 'rest', in her own way. She had delved through her feelings more than enough, for one day.. there would be plenty of time to figure out her emotions, especially those as pertained to her Master, later. It would be a good deal of time until he could resurrect her, after all.. and then everything would change.</br></font>"}, "post-23220": {"user": "Ulfang von Haren", "user_num": 416, "timestamp": "1455072472000", "message": "Ulfang awakens fairly early in the morning, about five hours after he'd fallen asleep, to the cooing of a Mourning Dove perched upon the windowsill.

It's a rather odd amalgam of foods, and the server looks at him oddly with every order. While he eats, he explains the taste and texture to Azure, clearly enjoying enlightening her very much.Around late afternoon, the pair visit the garden, sitting on a bench about half way through their visit and simply watching the hummingbirds partake in the sweet nectar of the flowers, the bumblebees lazily drifting from one to another, the sparrows and pigeons hopping and waddling about, singing and cooing their lovely songs.Next, Ulfang purposefully gets them lost upon the streets, in order to explore the winding pathways and ancient architecture of the city, refusing assistance in finding his way despite Azure's urging that she can use her abilities to get them back on track.Finally, they arrive back at the hotel at about an hour before dusk, after a long day of exploring the city and its wonders.\"Ah, a lovely city if ever I've seen one,\" remarks Ulfang with a bright grin down at Azure, \"did you enjoy our excursion today?\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Ulfang gives a bemused grin and says, with a slight hint of sarcasm to his bassy tones, \"Indeed, you seem so very elated, Azure.\""}, "post-23351": {"user": null, "user_num": null, "timestamp": "1455136561000", "message": "It had been a very interesting day for Azure.

Perhaps you could help me replenish them! Until recently, the Harenhalls had been completely decimated, but with the help of my undead servants I have restored them to their former glory. Still, the undead are rather terrible at aesthetic pursuits, so no longer do paintings line the corridors, or music waft through the mead halls. Flowers and bushes no longer grow in the gardens, instead taken over by weeds and thistle. I was never one for gardening, either,\" he continues.With that, he ponders, before speaking up again. \"You know, I just realised, you will be only the second live being to set foot in Harenhall since its reconstruction. As of now, it's only home to a horde of undead guardians. Dull company, really.\"It would seem that Ulfang didn't notice all the looks of various forms of disgust.

However, if one is to assume Camilla would probably be more well informed than her cousin here, and Camilla didn\u2019t seem to know much of anything in regards to current events, so Faisine must know less than that, even.With that in mind, Naoki responds, \u201cWell, in that case, allow me to fill you in.\u201d\u201cRoughly one year ago, there was a coup in Medan. King Hylon Emarae was killed in the first stages of it, and while the exact fate of Evrand Emarae is still uncertain, it is being assumed that he was killed as well, in addition to the majority of loyal Medanese government officials.\u201dUnsure of how close Faisine was to either of those, Naoki allows her a moment to stomach that before continuing, \u201cIn the place of the old government, another was put into place, and they called the \u2018new\u2019 nation Goraia. It was, at first, lead by a figure who went by \u2018Lord Zephidel\u2019, but he has since disappeared from the picture, and now there is an \u2018Empress Jill\u2019 who seems to be in charge.\u201d This is all stated very factually, with little to no inflection of emotion on Naoki\u2019s part. However, as she continues, an edge of anger creeps into her tone, \u201cAnd, to make a long and very painful story short, they\u2019re an awful government. They enslave their citizens, brainwash their soldiers, and commit all manner of atrocities on a daily basis. I have heard firsthand accounts from young ladies even younger than yourself- who were taken against their will, drugged, raped, and made to do the bidding of those corrupt officials. That\u2019s why I\u2019m going to remove them.\u201dWith this, Naoki stabs one finger down into the arm of her chair, unrestrained anger and passion flaring for a moment in her eyes. However, she takes a deep breath to calm herself and continues after a moment. \u201cAnd, as stated, I intend to install Camilla as regent until her children are fit to rule. In speaking with her about it, she suggested that I find you, enlist your assistance, and \u2018take you to see for yourself the destruction you are blind to\u2019.\u201dWith this, Naoki stops. Again, that was sort of a lot to digest, and she did in a roundabout way answer Faisine\u2019s question, so she figures it best to allow the young lady to speak before continuing.

Apparently, this one thinks she can just casually skip her way away with no repercussions.

This position, combined with the robe she\u2019s wearing, would give anyone directly ahead a bit of an excellent view, but the seat chosen places Skarlet off to Naoki\u2019s right. \u201cOh,\u201d she remarks again, lapsing into silence for the space of another few moments. \u201cWell,\u201d she begins, \u201cKate and I have reached an understanding, wherein we recognize the cravings of the flesh and the pinning of the heart as distinct, and often differing. At any given moment, and even now, I miss her, and long to see her. To hug her and kiss her and spend time with her, and do all of the things that we like to do, because I am happiest in her presence. That\u2019s love.\u201d\u201cBut then simultaneously, I am a woman, and a rather salacious one, at that. My body, like any other, has cravings. Desires to breed and be bred are natural among almost all beings, as natural as fear, or hunger. Reproductive instincts are necessary for the continued existence of beings as a thing that exist. That\u2019s lust. Beyond that, my\u2026 upbringing, if you\u2019d like to call it that, has played a role in making me an especially libidinous person. For whatever reason, Kate seems similar in that respect, and as women, the both of us often long for things that the other cannot provide.\u201dPlacing one cupped hand in the vicinity of her groin, Naoki draws the hand upward in a curved motion before bringing it back down on the same path, alluding to just what sort of organ neither she nor Kate possesses. \u201cBut I digress. If she and I were to spend all of our time together, not much would get done. Either her plants, shop, and livelihood would die and fall into disrepair, or I would be unable to administrate Isra effectively. With this in mind, we both recognize that we cannot keep the other fully satiated indefinitely, and out of respect, do not disallow each other from sleeping with others. When I get back, I\u2019ll likely tell her about last night\u2019s encounter, make her a somewhat jealous, and then ravish her until such a point as she is no longer jealous and can no longer walk in a straight line. She may do something similar.\u201d With this, Naoki offers a small shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to say that this relationship I have with Kate is normal- it\u2019s not, or that you necessarily have to accept it, or mirror my values as your own, but I feel like it was important to articulate the state of things. If Kate had a problem with my dalliances or expresses one in the future, I would not be participating in such activities and would stop immediately, respectively. But\u2026 she doesn\u2019t, as far as she\u2019s told me, so I see no harm in having a bit of fun, as so long as my heart still belongs to her, things are honest between us, and I make love to her with more passion than any other. And it does, they are, and I do.\u201d\u201cAs for the spying\u2026 I would rather you not, really, but don\u2019t worry too much about it- don't feel bad. I don\u2019t have anything to hide from you as far as my personal life is concerned, and the only things I intend to keep from you are matters of the state that would make you a valuable prisoner, such as sensitive information about Isra\u2019s military, or plots that are underway. If you\u2019d like to know something in the future that knowing would not endanger you, just ask.\u201dWith this, Naoki offers Skarlet a small smile that is intended to seem reassuring but comes off as somewhat weak, as if tired, or defeated.

Not quite sure what the best course of action might be, though. If all you\u2019re looking to do is explore yourself, it would be very easy to simply invite anyone- you look good enough to get a queue of thirty or so gentlemen at any given point at The Sun, more if you announce as such beforehand.\u201d\u201cBut I don\u2019t think that\u2019s quite what you want. Less quantity, more quality, and reliability. If I understand correctly, you\u2019re looking for a partner, as opposed to just any stiff prick. And in that regard\u2026\u201dNaoki trails off for a moment, diverting her gaze to the side and ruminating for a few moments before continuing, \u201cI\u2019m not quite sure what advice to offer. Kate and I happened across each other more or less entirely by chance, and the relationship that followed is something that just sort of happened when we both came to the realization we were attracted to each other and it turned out that we\u2019re compatible with some sort of romantic level that I can\u2019t really speak to. Before I met her, I had no intentions of maintaining a romantic relationship of any sort- only ones of sexual nature, and that was and is very easy for me.\u201d\u201c... So I think the most you can probably do is start looking. If you come across someone that you think you might like to have a relationship with, talk to them, learn more about them, and try to see if your feelings are mutual. If they are- great, go ahead and take them on dates or however, and see how it turns out. Even if they\u2019re not \u2018the one\u2019, there\u2019s no innate harm in maintaining and then ending a relationship as so long as you\u2019re careful about it and honest with yourself. If your feelings aren\u2019t reciprocated, that\u2019s also fine. There are lots of people in this world, you shouldn\u2019t agonize about each one.\u201d\u201cBeyond that, I think you should be honest with yourself from the get-go. For a while, I had feelings for Kate but I was confused and unwilling to admit them to myself. Don\u2019t do that. And consider what sorts of qualities you might like to see in the sort of person you\u2019re looking for. You don\u2019t have to be too specific, but for example, Kate is an optimistic person. She\u2019s always bright and cheerful and looking at the better side of things. This serves to offset some of my pessimism and cynicism, and it\u2019s very good for me to have someone to whom I can speak about personal problems and have them comfort me and tell me that it will be alright. I appreciate that in her a lot, and it leads me to doubt the possibility of maintaining a romantic relationship with someone who isn\u2019t like that, or is too like myself as far as cynicism goes.\u201d\u201cBut you might want someone who\u2019s funny, who can make you laugh. Or someone who\u2019s strong and protective of you. There are a lot of qualities that one can appreciate in another, and you should consider what sorts of qualities you might be looking for in a partner. It\u2019ll give you some ideas about what you might want to look for. Similarly, you should consider what sorts of things you wouldn\u2019t like to see in a partner. For example, I don\u2019t very much like individuals who attempt to assert their dominance or superiority verbally. Talk is cheap and any king that has to say that he is the king is no real king. Someone who does that sort of thing would turn me off very quickly, and I would be unwilling to deal with them in any capacity more than I must. You ought to think about what qualities would make an individual unsuitable for you, and keep them in mind.\u201d\u201cAs for actually locating individuals\u2026 I don\u2019t have many ideas about that. There are lots of people in Isra. Lots of people come to The Sun and The Eclipse, and it would be fairly easy to approach them there. You could also try other establishments in Isra, or hang around The Citadel if you were so inclined. There are also plenty of people here in Gauldin. Lots of children of nobility who stand to inherit their parents\u2019 holdings. That sort can often be conceited, but they\u2019ve got good manners, generally speaking. You could also visit other nations- The Expanse might be good, or post some manner of notice that you\u2019re seeking a partner. Young men would be crawling out of the woodwork to present themselves to you, and one might be to your liking.\u201dWith this, Naoki offers a shrug of her shoulders, as that\u2019s most of what she has to offer for the moment.
