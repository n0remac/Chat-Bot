We can learn not only from mistakes, but our triumphs. For example I can view possible futures, so I know exactly how to throw a ball to hit a target. Of course this doesn't work very well in combat, outside of reacting to immediate threats. Time sight can be view at the speed of thought, but that still takes time. Beyond this time Sight works both ways, we can see past and future. Which means the actual use of time sight, is the acquisition of knowledge.
