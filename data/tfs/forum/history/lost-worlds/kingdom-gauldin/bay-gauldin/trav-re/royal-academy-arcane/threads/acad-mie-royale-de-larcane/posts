Just right the druid tears off a chunk, chews and swallows. Then says with a grin.\"To your third point, I didn't say respecting your title was a burden. I expressed a willing to address you by your title Noy\u00e9. With the caveat that you use mine. Which I note you chose not to do and as nobility shouldn't you lead by example? And the other caveat that the conversation would be short, stiff, and formal.\"Another pause, another mouthful of rabbit. \"I think we could have a perfectly friendly conversation without titles. It isn't as though I made up a name to insult you, like Lady A-Noy\u00e9-ing. Without titles we could have a lovely conversation because as two peers and potential new friends. With titles though it is a conversation between a druid and a noble lady of Gauldin. Which would, by your cultures rules require me to defer to you. Since by your cultures estimation I am commoner as I lack wealth, land, and noble rank.\"Vera finishes the first rabbit off and tosses it's bones in the fire. Wiping the grease off on a handkerchief she produces she concludes her thoughts.\"Now, well I am sure such a conversation would be very polite and friednly from your perspective, from mine it would be a different matter. Conversation with an emphasis on titles, rank, and social status just irritate the piss out of me. We druids as a rule don't much care for formality. I can do it if I have to, since I know it is polite to respect other cultures. However, this conversation isn't one I have to have. It is a purely voluntary one. So why would I chose to continue it, if you are going to insist on formality?\"Vera smiles sweetly and scoops up the other rabbit. What was with nobles and their titles.
