She still looked at her friend with concern but didn't voice it, hoping that her company would be enough to distract Feru from her own thoughts.Without ceremony or fanfare, Madame Naoki makes her way on foot through the streets of Trav\u00e9re. Though the primary and ostensible reason for her trip to Gauldin is one of pleasure, Naoki has something of a habit of mixing business and pleasure. As such, today she stalks the streets, gathering information. Because it\u2019s one thing to read about a city, observe it from a nearby hill, or observe it via secondhand scrying. It\u2019s entirely another to walk its streets and absorb its culture firsthand. Seeing as how intimate knowledge of foreign cities- especially one as significant as Trav\u00e9re is very good information to have, Naoki has dedicated the afternoon to gathering it. With this goal in mind, she moves through the streets apparently alone. However, a particularly astute observer would note that a handful of foreigners that- though they seem to be going about their own business, never stray particularly far from Naoki. In truth, these are undercover Sun Marshals, providing plain clothes escort. Regardless, as she moves through the throngs and navigates the thoroughfares, one individual in particular captures Naoki\u2019s interest. It\u2019s a woman (surprisingly enough). A woman who would seem to be sporting a pair of cat ears and a big, fluffy tail. Along with that, she also seems to be hefting a sword that seems nearly as large as she is, and is walking in the company of another woman- a taller one, with a distinct lack of cat features and some manner of polearm. Finding these women to be considerably more interesting than whatever else there might be to observe in the streets, Naoki diverts her course to follow them and remains behind- hopefully out of sight for a short while. After only a short walk, however, the pair turn and enter some manner of pub. Smirking slightly to herself, Naoki draws off to one side of the road, leans up against the side of some nondescript building, and resolves to wait outside for a few minutes as they settle themselves within.

The orange light of the setting sun cast long shadows on the buildings that surrounded him, and further off in the city Blank could see a clock tower looming, it was just about dinner time in\u00a0Trav\u00e9re.\u00a0Indeed, Blank would notice this as he meandered into a particular district of the city which seemed to have a restaurant or tavern of some sort at every corner, and the patron's of said establishments seemed to be everywhere, walking along the streets. Mostly Blank noticed those of perhaps more wealthy status in this part of the city, couples in fine dress walking arm-in-arm along the streets, as well as\u00a0bachelors no doubt looking for a woman of their own,and the single women they pursued, young and beautiful. Blank himself had come to learn of these concepts of love and romance on his travels thus far, yet still, they seemed somewhat odd to him. He was not at all interested in romantic pursuits as of yet, besides he looked completely out of place here in his travel-worn garb and over-all slightly grubby look, and he certainly got a few looks from the people who roamed\u00a0the streets, almost as if anticipating him to start begging them for coin.That was another thing he had noticed about\u00a0Trav\u00e9re. While the wealthy were easy enough to see, ambling about as the night-life just began to bloom, the less fortunate could also be found among them cowering in the less noticed crevasses of the city. Often one could find them in the alleyways, or other similar out of view places. They seemed to be an unwanted presence, often outright ignored by the common man going about his business should one try to beg. Blank figured they must still get some coin from those who were more sympathetic though, else they wouldn't be doing it. Blank did not want to end up begging, however, so he had to devise a source of income.\u00a0Blank eventually found himself walking into an open plaza, the ground was covered in an\u00a0intricately patterned cobblestone, and a large three-tiered fountain stood in the middle of the plaza. There were benches all around for people to sit on made of white marble. Some pots were also set about from which various decorative bushes grew, trimmed into a variety of shapes. Blank would choose one of the benches near the fountain to set himself down on to take in his surroundings and formulate a plan of action. He could try and get a job at one of the restaurants or taverns in the area he figured, though this might be somewhat hard. A lot of the places seemed to be quite upscale, no chance he could get hired looking the way he did. He also didn't want to beg if he didn't have to. What could he do then?Blank didn't know, he really didn't know much about Trav\u00e9re in the first place. Sighing, he would look in his pack and take out the last of his rations as his stomach had begun to grumble. He would idly nibble at a piece of bread as he thought further, listening to the sound of splashing water from the nearby fountain and din of people walking about and talking... but he also heard something else and the sound would certainly pique his interest. Finishing his small dinner, he would move to investigate.It was a busker, a street performer playing a soft and soothing tune on his violin. Laid on the ground before him was the case for said instrument propped open. Blank would watch curiously for a bit, wondering what exactly the man was doing until someone walked by and tossed a coin into the case and it was then that it dawned on him. The man, who seemed to be older, perhaps of middling years with slightly grayed hair, was performing for money. The tune he played seemed to please passerby's as some even paused to listen for a bit, and they always left the man a coin or two when they did.Blank would sit on a nearby bench to watch and listen to the man more closely, a child-like curiosity and wonderment coming over him as he observed for about half an hour as the sun set and sunlight was replaced by street lamps. During this time Blank figured out roughly how the man was able to elicit certain sounds from the instrument, watching closely to see how the man moved his hands, fingers, and arms during each note. The busker would eventually notice the curious young man who watched him so closely and would approach Blank during a lull in the crowd as most had already gone into the nearby establishments to eat.\"Hello there, I couldn't help but notice you watching me all this time. Are you perhaps a fellow musician?\"Blank, who was still somewhat startled the man had approached him would shake his head, before composing himself, \"Perhaps, though I don't have any money right now for one of those,\" Blank would indicate towards the violin the man held.The man looked somewhat confused, \"You mean this? This is a violin, surely you would know this if you are a musician of any sort.\"The busker's previously friendly countenance wavered slightly at Blank's somewhat eccentric response. Perhaps he shouldn't have approached this man?Blank would respond before he got the chance to back away, \"Would it be alright if I tried playing that violin for a moment?\"\u00a0Leaning forward Blank would take a closer look at the wooden instrument, slightly invading the busker's personal space, though Blank seemed somewhat oblivious to the man's slight discomfort.\u00a0\"I'm not sure, I don't think I would be able to catch you if you decided to run away with it, why would I-\"He is cut off by Blank tossing his bag towards him, \"Here is some collateral, it is all I own besides the clothes I wear on my back. Besides there are guards all over, surely one of them would catch me in no time should you yell out.\" This seems to convince the man as he gives a small nod, and hands over the violin to Blank. Blank let a wide grin spread across his face the moment he gets his hands on the instrument as he can finally test out all the theories he had formulated from watching the man play.\u00a0Touching the bow gingerly on the strings, Blank would pull across them eliciting a brief out of tune sound that was altogether unpleasing to the ear. At this Blank would pause for a few moments, looking at the instrument critically in his hands, the busker would frown then.\"Well?\"The man's rushing would not bother Blank however as in the next moment he began, setting off to play one of the songs the busker had played, it sounded completely identical. Once the brief song was finished the busker stood for a moment, clearly somewhat shocked at what Blank just did, considering he didn't seem to know what a violin was a couple minutes ago.Blank seemed completely oblivious to the man's current shock, however, \"Mind if I try another song?\" The man would quickly nod, and Blank would nod in return before beginning a\u00a0new piece.\u00a0 This song was different, however, as it was not anything at all like what the man had played, yet it was pleasing to the ear and could be mistaken for any piece of music already written by a composer. Blank was making it up as he went along, though, following certain patterns in the music he had devised to figure out what sorts of tunes pleased people the most.A crowd had formed once Blank had finished his own piece, and quite a few coins were deposited in the man's case by the crowd. One man in particular, an old wizened man in elegant finery left a particularly hefty sum in the case, which made the busker's eyes nearly bulge out of his head.Blank would cut back in now, as the crowd dispersed, \"So, since I played that last piece that attracted a bit of attention, would you mind if I took a small cut? You can have most of it, I just need a bit of coin to get myself started, perhaps buy myself one of these violins,\" Blank would smirk slightly, \"Also, if you help me out here I promise I will play somewhere else, I wouldn't want to take all of your business.\"The man glared at Blank momentarily but would then falter, \"You've got a lot of nerve, and I don't know what you're up to. There is no way you could have learned to play the violin so well right on the spot. I have been playing for years, and you are perhaps better than me. It's impossible. Either way, you played damn well, I will let you have your coin if you so desperately need it, I am not hurting much for money myself.\"Blank would nod his thanks, before taking his pack and scooping up a couple handfuls of coins (it was a large crowd) into his pack before heading off. Now that he had some coin, he could really get started in Trav\u00e9re.", "link_list": ["https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXDQ-QliMJI"], "image_list": [], "html": "<u>Streets of\u00a0Trav\u00e9re Late Afternoon</u>"}}
