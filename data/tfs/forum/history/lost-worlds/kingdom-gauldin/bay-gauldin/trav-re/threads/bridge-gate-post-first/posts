Two hundred thundering hooves roll up and come to a stop a short ways away from the Bridge-Gate of Trav\u00e9re. They pull over to the side of the road as not to disrupt traffic, cavalrymen and all, and remain mounted for a moment. From her gray mare at the head of the procession, Madame Naoki looks to the city. Across the arch bridge lies Trav\u00e9re, capital of The Kingdom of Gauldin. Though she had seen the city a few times through Reese\u2019s looking glasses, and has seen numerous artistic renditions, to stand here on the coast and look out over it all is an entirely superior experience. A city built on an cove island, merchant, fishing and navy ships alike swarm like small insects around the base; sailing to and fro, docking and undocking, navigating the waters surrounding the city. Further up, the bulk of the city is visible in red-roofed homes and great arching architecture. Nestled farther back, The Royal Academy of the Arcane is visible, with its white marble domes peeking up over the residential district. And of course, at the very peak of the small mountain of the island, its steeples highest of all, is The Royal Palace, Le Palais Des Ailes, The Palace of Wings. Truly a sight to behold, Trav\u00e9re and its palace. However, Naoki is looking for none of these things. After taking some time to digest the sights, Naoki\u2019s gaze falls back down to the waterline, the docks, where ships continue to move and dock. Using a large, gray-sailed brigantine as her point of reference, she shortly locates the individual she is searching for. Sitting on the far end of one of the docks, a single, unremarkable man sits fishing, wooden pole held between his legs. Upon noticing this man, Naoki\u2019s ear (and with it, her earring), begins to move and twitch erratically. One watching from behind might think that something had gotten caught in the tuft of her ear, but in reality, she is signaling down to the man on the pier. The sun glints and flashes in a short pattern, reflecting down to shimmer in the eyes of the fisher. Shortly, he responds with his own short code of flashes, before opening mental communication. Naoki\u2019s earring ceases its twitching and begins to glow as she makes contact with her contact, and by extension, the rest of her men in the city. Sent ahead months previous by Reese, it has been their task to keep tabs on the city of Trav\u00e9re, and report back information on the happenings within. However, today, their task is to ensure the safety of the Embassy and its guests in a covert manner. The fisher informs Naoki that all seems to be well within the city, and that they judge conditions safe to proceed. She responds with acknowledgement, affirmation, and her plans to proceed. The whole exchange doesn\u2019t take longer than a minute, and immediately following it, Madame Naoki turns to her comrades, suggesting that they prepare themselves to enter the city. Madame Naoki is aware of the symbolic value of what they\u2019re about to do, and prepares herself accordingly. The Ambassador of Isra, visiting Gauldin with the stated intention to create a strong and lasting alliance between the two great nations. Quiet implications and kind words had made it seem now to all that King Renaux is not opposed to the idea, and plans to receive the embassy warmly. Assuming all goes as it seems it will, this will be a momentous occasion, or at least one of the minor events leading up to one. Even now, some passing travelers exiting the city pause to eye our party, recognizing the Isranian Sun insignia present on the uniformed embassy members. Some stern looks from the crossbow toting lieutenant see them along, but it brings to mind an important consideration: the public will be watching. The King himself may be present for their arrival, as well. The accommodations regarding their arrival had not been reviewed in much detail, so Naoki is unaware of how exactly the government plans to handle her arrival. She lances down at her attire. A black riding coat over a white tunic. Even though the tunic is quite tight, it\u2019s hardly the most flattering outfit in her arsenal of attire at the moment... She glances to the silver box strapped to one side of the horse\u2019s flank. Hm. After a moment of consideration, she reaches into the pouch on her hip, and pulls out a gemstone. A bit of polished but uncut smokey quartz, she wastes no time in channeling a bit of energy into it and tossing it to the ground. Instantly, a plume of whitish gray smoke matching the color of the gemstone erupts from the ground, immediately obscuring Madame Naoki, her horse, as well as Artemis, the lieutenant, along with their mounts. Over the course of about a minute, the smoke gradually dissipates, revealing the same three mounted figures as before, but with one major change. Naoki is now wearing her recently purchased gown, and sitting sidesaddle. First impressions are of the utmost importance. The silver box remains shut and strapped as it was to the saddlebags, but now contains her riding clothes. Something of a quick change artist, it seems. She moves as if to adjust the fit, but hesitates before lowering her arms again; no adjustments need to be made. Amazing. With this change of attire and demeanor made, and once again in full view of any who might care to ogle, Naoki reaches back ever-so-slowly into her saddlebags and pull out her travel papers, still rolled into a scroll. With the reins in one hand and the papers in the other, Naoki gestures to her group, indicating that they should follow her. A short communication to the cavalry lieutenant sees the guards splitting off to form a new formation on the road. Now that the group have reached Trav\u00e9re, security would become the responsibility of the city guard and Naoki\u2019s stationed men. Guiding her horse back onto the road and to the gate, Naoki leads the other nineteen members of her party directly up to the gatehouse, and stops wherever it would seem appropriate to do so. A guard approaches, and formally requests to see travel papers. With a perhaps over-exaggerated leaning motion, she provides them, along with a few hushed Gaudlish words to the guardsman. He blushes profusely as he checks the papers over, and evidently finds them in order, as he mutters his approval and returns the papers. Naoki receives them, and proceeds on horseback through the gate, \u2018accidentally\u2019 brushing her tail across the guardsman\u2019s face as she does so. Naoki stops just inside the gate on the first span of the bridge, and pulls over to one side of the thoroughfare, a position from which she considers the wandering eyes of the other passersby with a mischievously raised eyebrow. However, it isn\u2019t long before the rest of the group is passed through the gate, and Naoki proceeds to lead them across the bridge and into the city proper toward the palace.
