I am professor Vywrick, and I hope you'll have as much fun as a student in this course as I will teaching it! It will be an exciting quarter as we prepare you for further studies down the line and build for you a solid foundation of knowledge and practice. This class is a prerequisite to a vast number of other courses and will help prepare you for your academic goals here at the Royal Academy of the Arcane.A little about myself: I've been practicing wizardry for approximately ninety years and have been teaching for going on fifty. I studied here at the Royal Academy of the Arcane in my youth and excelled in potions and was head of the thaumaturgy team. I've taught numerous classes abroad, including the famous Arcane Academy in Stonevale, Medan.This class is designed to teach the basic fundamentals of paranormal forces that occur in our world. Students will learn various common classifications of magic, their applications, and their origins. Upon completion, students should demonstrate some understanding in magical theory, including leylines, the parameters of a spell, channeling, enchantment theory, and more.RulesWhile I want this course to be fun for you, there are rules you must follow. These are for your benefit.1)  No food or drink in the classroom. If something were to be spilled while we are doing practical lessons someone could fall and get hurt.2)  Be respectful.3)  No cheating. It will not be tolerated. You will receive a 2% on the assignment, which is an automatic fail.4) Plagiarism of any kind will not be tolerated. It is important that any work you submit is your own work. Any student caught plagiarizing will receive a 3% on the assignment, which is an automatic fail.5)  Study.If you are registered for this class, please sign in on the sign-in sheet and take your seat.

Some associate their capabilities with magical items, and others have had their powers bestowed upon them by another entity.
