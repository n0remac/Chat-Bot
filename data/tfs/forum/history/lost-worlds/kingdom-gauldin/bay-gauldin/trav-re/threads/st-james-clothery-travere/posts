J A M E S\u00a0Clothery\u00a0The outside of the charming building\u00a0Located in the bottom-most floor of this clean building is the St. James Clothery, a store that specializes in enchanted items made of textiles of cloth, and sparse leather. Everything for purchase inside the store is enchanted in some way, but the curious thing about the items is that they seem to pick the wearer. \u00a0One corner of the downstairs shop is dedicated to being a salon, a place where people can rest comfortably among sofas and genteel furniture and art. Often times when a well-to-do customer enters and wants a custom order from the proprietess of the shop, Genevieve (jon-vee-ev) St. James, they will discuss fashion, style, and necessary enchantments in that corner. There is always hot beverages and snacks available to drink or eat.\u00a0The salon sitting area. The rest of the shop is also decorated in this Gauldish manner, meant to be tasteful and feminine.\u00a0When coming upon St. James Clothery, those that are magic sensitive will sense that the building itself seems to be alive with magic, and a strong magic of protection. Once inside the building, there is a feeling of calm and security, as if all those that have walked through the door have walked into their own comfortable homes. The building is enchanted, however, and the doorway of the clothing story has a special handle that leads to Isra, Travere, and Fletcher, so far.\u00a0All those who enter will be greeted personally by the owner, an elegant widow by the name of Genevieve (jon-vee-ev) St. James, known to be the half-sister of the Queen of Gauldin and the aunt of Gauldin's crown prince. Although there is an air of distinguished sophistication about her, there is also a sense of true and genuine kindness... as well as a melancholy withing her gaze.\u00a0St. James Clothery is not a place to buy enchanted trinkets made of metal or leather, as almost all items within are items that were fatewoven by the enchantress who runs the building.\u00a0Location: The St. James Clothery permanent location is in Fletcher, Aozora. Through fateweaving and enchantments, there is a presence of the shop in Isra and in Travere, Gauldin. People who visit the store from these cities are actually stepping into a travel spell. The view outside of the windows is not that of Travere or Isra, but of Fletcher Aozora.
