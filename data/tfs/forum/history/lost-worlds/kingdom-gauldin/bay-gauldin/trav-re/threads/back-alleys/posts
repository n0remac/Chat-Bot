She had promised Marie. But still, Capris was out here. She couldn't help it. She didn't know why, but there was a darkness in her, a thirst in her, a need in her to, to devour life. The only time she ever felt a thrill the same was when she was on stage, but even so... the high, the sheer... wonder... of feeling a pulse fade away...Just remembering it put goosebumps on her skin. So she was out now, in dark clothes, a cloak over her and her hood shadowing her face. She was searching... searching for someone.

Capris drew back into the shadows as two men stumbled from a whore house, laughing even as outraged whores threw things at them from the street. It was the usual game between them -- the men who paid, the women who gave -- and Capris couldn't take her eyes away from them.The two of them swayed like ships on a turbulent sea, unable to fully stand on their own so they leaned on each other. They were singing some bawdy Gauldish song between them, and as they passed beneath a oil street light, she could see that they were moderately-well dressed. Sailors, perhaps. Or carpenters. Or some sort of man that wasn't rich enough to matter, but just successful enough to have extra coin to spend.One of them dropped down to sit while the other swayed. They had a short conversation, and then the one still standing swaggered on over to the shadows where she hid, adjusting his pants, no doubt to relieve himself. He came close and leaned one palm against the wall as he peed into the alleyway...... and all the while, Capris watched and fought with herself.To kill... or not to kill?", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Giggling and laughter.

He squinted into the half-shadows where she was leaning in a smaller alleyway that twisted off from the one he and his friend had stumbled down.He saw her and leaned back a little, as if he couldn't believe that she was there. It was too late, she had him now. He saw her, and she wanted to kill him, especially when he smiled that look at her. She lifted her hands and pulled back the hood from her pale hair, showing a little more of her beauty. Her cloak fell open but for where it was tied at her throat as her hands moved, and the man watched her.Her fingers drifted to the ties of her bodice and she tugged them, taking a step back into the small alley. The man then grinned broadly, and behind him there was a clatter of a bottle as his friend passed out and the bottle rolled down the alleyway.This man however followed Capris into the darkness, both of them disappearing into the inky black darkness. There was the quiet sound of a sigh, a masculine groan, the whisper of material rustling -- and then the wet sound of a knife, a yell that was cut off and muted, as if behind something else. A small skirmish....... and then nothing.Quietness... ... but for the small, innocuous squish as if someone was cutting into and playing with something wet and warm...", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The smell of his urine, even the smell of "}}
