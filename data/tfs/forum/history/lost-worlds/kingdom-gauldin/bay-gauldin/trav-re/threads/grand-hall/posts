A plain white silk shirt, brown leather leggings, and tall functional boots. If it wasn't for the bastard sword at his hip, and the crown of wings on his brow, he would look like a well to do merchant. He had refused to follow the recent fashion trends in the city, and as such soon all the men would be following his lead. The one perk of being king, he got to dictate what was in style.

She can hardly breathe as she places her hands over her mouth. He is...well, the only word she can think of is \"glorious\". His clothes bother her not at all; they're still far more expensive than she's used to. To her, he looks just how a king should.\"Oh wow.
