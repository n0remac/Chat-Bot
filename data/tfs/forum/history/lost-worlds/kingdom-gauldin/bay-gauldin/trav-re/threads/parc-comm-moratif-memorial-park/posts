His voice starts out hesitant, but as he gathers his will he becomes more confident.\"It was.. not mine to be king. My brother the late Prince Vyun was the one who was raised to take the throne. I suppose some of you may think being king as an enviable position, I never did. I listened to some of the lessons that my father passed onto Vyun and one stayed with me.\"Renaux pauses closes his eyes and then reciting from memory.\"To whom much is given much is expected, wearing the crown grants you much power but even more responsibility. We rule at the peoples pleasure we are just as much their servants, as they are ours. Be strong, be wise, be kind, place your people first and you will be a great king.\"The young king opens his eyes and continues.\"The idea of that much responsibility terrified me as a boy. That is why I decided I did not want to have anything given to me, I ran from my responsibilities as prince. Many of you may already know this but I pretended to be a peasant for much of my life. I enrolled in the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de le P\u00e9gase, and I worked hard to earn a spot among the Pegasus Knights. I always suspected my father hated me for doing this, in my ten years of service I never once heard from him. But I didn't care, I was comfortable. and I was happy. the only responsibilities I had where those I choose to take on. As you know this did not last my father and brother died, and I was left the sole heir to the throne.\"Renaux begins to cry at the memory and his voice cracks as a lump forms in his throat.\"When I first heard the news I was so angry. How dare they die, how dare they force the crown upon me, it wasn't for me, I didn't want it. With the anger of course came guilt. How could I be so childish? How could I feel anger when I should feel sorrow? But I couldn't help myself grief takes strange paths, and we often rile against the hand fate deals us.\"Tears still streaming down his face Renaux, his voice though recovers and he says firmly.\"I returned to the palace after the funeral and I sat at my fathers desk, even to this day I cannot think of it as my own. I begin to listlessly shuffle through his papers. I was lost I didn't know what to do I had gone from a knight of the realm to its leader and it was all too much. However on his desk in a stack of letters I found an envelope addressed to me, it was old, faded, and had clearly been opened many times. Inside there were pages of letters from my father to me and I began to read through them. They were letters saying how proud he was of me, how he admired me, how he was glad I found my own path. I sat there stunned, I do not know why he never sent those letters, I fear I will never know. All I know is in that moment when things seemed darkest when I had lost all hope, those letters gave me the strength to go on. They gave me the will to become the man my father thought I was, and to become a king he could be proud of. I sat at my fathers desk and I wept all anger, all guilt gone, left only with sorrow and hope.\"Renaux takes a long deep breath, his tears slowly stop and he smiles gently at the crowd.\"I tell you this story because we have all recently been plunged into darkness, through circumstances beyond our control. Many of you may have thought me callous to proceed with my wedding, with so many fresh dead, and the city still seized by terror. But I do not do this out of callousness, I do it because it is my hope to provide you with the same spark those letters gave me. Will we mourn? Yes of course we will in the weeks to come we will grieve for what we have lost. But tonight I want you to find a spark, I want you to find your joy, and your salvation, I want you to remember that no matter how bad things are life is still worth living. Tonight I want you to celebrate because those we lost would not want us to spend the rest of our lives in darkness.\"The king falls silent, he has no idea what kind of effect his speech will have.

The warm orange sun washed its rays across the landscape, slowly painting splotches of radiance through the trees onto the fresh green grass. Likely there would be joggers, dog-walkers, and even families getting ready to play, picnic, and have a good time.But then some of them would notice a musk in the air. At first it wouldn't seem all that offensive, organic, heavy, with a hint of perfume. But as the morning progressed and the sun continued to rise, the air would turn nauseating. The musk would suddenly evolve into a vile, unbearable stench. A few astute observers would notice clouds of gnats beginning to congregate themselves into eager little swarms, like an international convention of detritivorous insects.Then the first scream would be heard, followed closely by a second and a third. At the very center of the memorial park more and more people would start screaming.\"Appelez les gardes! Appelez les gardes!\"\"Pourquoi mon Dieu pourquoi?\"\"Qui a fait \u00e7a? Pourquoi?\"In the middle of the park was the monument, a place for people to pay their respects. But the only ones who appeared to be truly paying their dues were the dozen bodies contorted into kneeling poses, lined in two rows with a single person in front. They consisted of both men and women, young and old, their backs stratified with whip lashes until their backs were bright red with exposed muscle tissue. There were floggers at their feet, almost as if they had done this to themselves.They were quite stiff, between the cold and rigor mortis. Upon closer examination one would find slits on all their throats, although the volume of blood spilled and soaked into the grass would be a bit less than expected. Perhaps the smaller insects had already finished feasting...But who would notice something like that? The main attraction was evidently the monument, which had been tagged with blue azurite paint to say the following message.\"THEY WERE DISLOYAL IN LIFE! MAY THEY BE LOYAL IN DEATH! LONG LIVE THE KING! -LA GARDE D'HONNEUR\"The people would most likely start to panic and whisper. Then they'd notice something else. Underneath and to the side of the graffiti was a white cloth. There was nothing special about it. Closer examination of the bodies again would reveal another cloth, this one yellow, though stained with brown blood. The guards and investigators who stayed long enough to endure the full brutality of the scene would, perhaps after a while, decipher the true meaning behind the mysterious orientation, especially when they mapped it out on paper.If one took some liberties with the blue message and mostly focused on the positioning of the other facets of the scene, the whole thing would be reminiscent of the flag of Gauldin.Off in the distance, a single hyena would laugh and run off into the brush, not to be seen by anyone.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "(Alright, I'm just gonna leave this here.)"}, "post-19986": {"user": "The Kingdom of Gauldin", "user_num": 882, "timestamp": "1451424740000", "message": "The guards of Gauldin were still on high alert so soon after the attack.

I find myself intrigued, though reluctant to leave the safety Gauldin has to offer... After all, I am cousin to the Princess Camilla, the poor dear.

However, I have already offended Her Highness without meaning to, and I fear she would turn me away if I were to ask for coin.

I could not accept the coin if I were to stay.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 With that being said, I fear you are the only one to have come to my aid at this point.
