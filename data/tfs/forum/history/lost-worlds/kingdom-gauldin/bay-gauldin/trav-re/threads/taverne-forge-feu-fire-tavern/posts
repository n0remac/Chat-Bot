More specifically, when he crossed the threshold into Zar\u00e6n's workshop things went rather poorly. The door slammed shut and wards flared to life, preventing exit by any means both physical and magical. Then in the back corner a very large golem gets to it's feet. The floor shudders as it stomps towards the intruder. Suddenly Zar\u00e6n's friendly voice sounds.\"Bonjour! If you are hearing this you entered my workshop without my permission. This was a very poor choice. I recommend laying down on the floor with your hands on your head. If you don't my creation is under orders to break every bone in your body.

She supposes she should have expected it, really: meeting individuals with preconceived notions of her. That sort of comes with being a public figure of such scale. But yet, she failed to account for it, and it sort of throws a bit of a metaphorical wrench in how she intended to handle this encounter. Making a note to keep that sort of thing in mind next time, Naoki resolves to simply play this by ear and cringes inwardly at her own accidental pun. Gesturing to the approaching barmaid, Naoki indicates Feru\u2019s drink, \u201cI\u2019ll have one of those, thank you.\u201d Whatever it is, it smells somewhat pleasant, so Naoki simply hopes that it isn't extremely alcoholic. Now properly seated, Naoki takes a moment to eyeball the pair that is now her dining companions, now that she has the opportunity to. One of them- with the regular ears, is a tall one. It isn\u2019t often that Naoki meets women who are taller than she is, but there she is. The way she\u2019s built, Naoki finds it to be somewhat similar to the way Kate is structured, albeit significantly scaled up. Seeing as how she seems to be Aaedenian, that makes a fair bit of sense, Naoki supposes. (Their men tend to be pretty big as well, Naoki has found.)The other woman, Naoki reflects as she ogles her, probably looks an awful lot like herself. (Or vice versa, depending on how you might like to consider it.) She seems to be ever-so-slightly shorter, her hair less red and more chestnutty, green eyes instead of amber, and she seems to be a bit more toward the muscular end of the Muscular to Curvy Spectrum, but otherwise\u2026 Actually, she supposes that actually, most of the resemblance comes in the cat features, and otherwise they\u2019re more or less their own individuals, and decides that that\u2019s quite enough aimless contemplation in that regard. Naoki also notes the... large weapons the pair of them seem to be toting. Some questions regarding the practicality of these weapons come to mind, but they aren\u2019t nearly as interesting as the other questions Naoki has, so she dismisses them. Launching directly into it, Naoki takes into account that she had just been introduced, and inquires, \u201cIf I might, who do I have the pleasure of dining with tonight, and what would each of you suggest in terms of something to eat?\u201d", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\u201cEhm, thank you.\u201d"}, "post-53019": {"user": "Feru din Narith", "user_num": 1084, "timestamp": "1475892036000", "message": "\"Who?

As enticing as her current company seems, something about the woman seems vaguely familiar. Without getting closer, Naoki can\u2019t quite place it but makes a mental note regardless.Returning her attention to the women she\u2019s seated with, Naoki nods quietly, but noncommittally. As it turns out, Naoki is fully aware that Gauldish cheese is very good, having already sampled it in the royal palace, and written and executed upon trade agreements to import Gauldish cheese to Isra. She was sort of looking for a suggestion specific to the tavern they\u2019re sitting in, something that she could order directly from the wait staff without having to consult the menu. But it isn\u2019t of any particular consequence, Naoki supposes. She isn\u2019t hungry anyway- a drink will be enough. As if on cue, the waitress returns with what Naoki, placing it on the table next to her before quickly excusing herself. Taking it in one hand, Naoki eyes it for a moment in an attempt to discern what sort of thing it is. It seems to be a beer of sorts, but certainly not of any sort Naoki has had to date. This can, of course, be partially attributed that Naoki does not drink beer, and in fact, doesn\u2019t really care for it at all, but that\u2019s what she gets for trying to be excessively casual instead of actually spending the time to select something decent to drink. Still, she raises the flagon to her lips and has a bit of a sip. Midway through, she pauses and lowers the glass slowly. Is it... cinnamon? That is some strange stuff, Naoki muses. Why would you flavor beer with cinnamon? Deciding that it isn\u2019t at all to her liking, Naoki resolves to leave the drink where it is for the remainder of her time at the table. In an attempt to continue the pretense of causality, Naoki directs a question at the women and raises her inquisitive eyebrow, \u201cSo I take it the pair of you aren\u2019t from around here, then?\u201d This question is, of course somewhat superfluous, considering the manner in which the pair of them referred to Gauldin in the third person, but it\u2019s at least an effort to make small talk.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Nodding to them each in turn, Naoki responds simply- perhaps a bit curtly, \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you both.\u201d"}, "post-53185": {"user": "Faisine of the Usque", "user_num": 46, "timestamp": "1476198008000", "message": "A waitress came by, she simply pushed her money over and quietly ordered what she could afford with what she had.
