The roads are well traveled between the villages, relatively well-fed and generally happy people criss-crossing\u00a0Arcoux\u00a0in pursuit of happiness, money, or the occasional drunken wandering. Guards are also frequent due to the occasional tribal or bandit incursion. The above is the only real threat to the people of Arcoux, and even then it is a local one, the instigators of such events are brought to a swift and terrible justice administered by the tip of a sword. Or axe, as the situation may require.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://imgur.com/8XFdDK6.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://imgur.com/8XFdDK6.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}}
