Was going off the picture)The usual and predictable steps were taken, the Marquis presenting himself, being recognized and admitted by the guard, so and so boring forth. It was all so formulaic that the bored expression on the Marquis' handsome face really never lifted, even though he sat elegantly in his saddle. His small party moved easily through into the Keep, and although the Marquis was not exactly unimpressed by the Duke's abode, he was less noticing of it than his compatriots. After all, the Marquis kept grand grounds himself, and was usually surrounded by wealth and luxury given where he chose to spend his time. He and his party dismounted, and the reins of their horses were given off to his valet and the stablelad who went off to see them quartered. The valet, no doubt, would be joining the Marquis of Jourdain later, after the four horses had been settled and the stablelad was comfortable.Escorted into the castle, the Marquis waited for his presence to be announced to the Duke while the Marquis perused a work of art set in the grand foyer.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "(No problem, and sorry if I assumed too much.
