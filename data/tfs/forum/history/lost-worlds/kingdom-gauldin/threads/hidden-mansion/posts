Nobody ever goes in or out, except under the cover of night. It's a long way from any city or village, and isn't on any official register. In fact, officially, it doesn't exist. Very few people even know of its existence.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/PZjuFa4.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/PZjuFa4.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}, "post-46628": {"user": "Rene Elat", "user_num": 1769, "timestamp": "1471396882000", "message": "Soft piano music played as Rene Elat danced alone. She whirled gracefully through the empty ballroom, kept company only by Moore, the blind pianist. Her technique was flawless, honed from years upon years of practice and repetition. As the music came to an end, she finished her routine just in time to see a nervous-looking butler enter the ballroom. She looked over at the butler, annoyed at the interruption.\"What is it?\"The butler flinched at her tone, and was unable to meet her gaze.\"Miss Elat...there's been terrible news. Your mother's been arrested.\"He held out a trembling hand, offering her an ornate hand mirror. She plucked the mirror from his hand, staring into it. Instead of her own reflection, however, it showed a very different scene: some dark underground hideout. A man she vaguely recognized as a high-ranking member of the cartel stood on the other side of the mirror, his face grim.\"It's true, Miss. Your mother's been arrested. No news as to her sentencing yet, it's only just happened. She's been taken away, probably to the Bastille. King's orders, apparently.\"Rene stared back, barely believing what she was hearing. Her mother had been arrested? How had she been so careless?\u00a0\"What happened? How do you know it was the king's orders?\"The man in the mirror sighed.\"We heard it from a baker. It happened in his shop. Some foreign dignitary was there, and her bodyguard got arrested too. Only your mother was taken away, though. They teleported in and out.\"Rene chuckled dryly. Arrested in a bakery? Really? How pitiful.\"Well then, what's our plan of action? Do we have the lawyers ready?\"The man in the mirror nodded.\"Yes, they've already ironed their ties. You're to stay put, you understand? Stay at the mansion, where you're safe. We'll handle the business until the Godmother is freed, understand?\"Rene nodded as well. She understood, alright. They were definitely loyal enough. They'd run the business, and they'd get her mother out of prison. Just as they were told.\"Alright, I'll do that. Thank you, Mr. Til\u00e9.\"She blew on the mirror, and the image vanished and was replaced with a crystal-clear reflection like one would expect from an ordinary mirror. She turned to the butler, who shrank away from her gaze.\"Prepare the carriage. The cartel is under my command until my mother is free, effective immediately. We're going to town.\"The butler nodded. He knew this would happen. Rene was such a scary girl when she had a goal in mind. So determined.\"Right away, Miss Elat.\"Rene donned a fur coat (enchanted to block arrows and knives) and slipped the mirror into her pocket. As an afterthought, she turned back to the butler.\"Enough of that Miss Elat business. You know should know better.\"And the butler did know better. He knew exactly what title Rene Elat now held. She really was the spitting image of her mother, especially when she had her eyes set on a prize. So scary.\"Yes...Godmother.\"Rene nodded, approvingly. She could get used to this.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Soft piano music played as Rene Elat danced alone.
