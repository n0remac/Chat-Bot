It was a disgusting thought to have passed through her mind, she lost what little appetite she had. \"Excuse me, please, for a moment.\" She didn't wait for anyone to reply but stood up and walked away from the group so she could get a hold of herself. Blake hadn't known about the field of flowers back in Medan, he couldn't have... It was not like he deliberately delved into her memory bank and took a page from that book. Just the same, though, it stung. She went in the direction they came from.Only she didn't stop. She just started to run as soon as she was beyond the treeline, just beyond sight, dropping her shawl along the way, shoes both coming off of her feet. She ran, not looking back toward the group of people that were trying to give her some glimpse of normalcy. Her hair came loose from the snood she wore, strands flying every which way as they caught the breeze of her flight...\u00a0She didn't stop running until she blindly hooked her foot through a root and went down. She ignored the pain of her now, throbbing ankle and foot, and buried her face in the crook of her arm.Camilla groaned... Feeling extra foolish at the moment. She laughed at herself, then pushed herself up onto her knees. A deep breath was taken, her eyes closed as she relished the moment alone. Obviously they would come looking for her, but for that moment, she was in sanctuary where none could see her. Her head tilted back, she took another deep breath and let the forest clear her mind.The sounds of whispers came to her, all around her. Whispers that were so familiar, yet so foreign. The princess stood and followed the sound of her name from within the thicket. Camilllllaaa...... Cammmilllllaaa... Had she lost it? Perhaps it would seem so to someone who might walk up on her this way, but this was nothing new to her... It was something that hadn't happened in a while, but it was no news to her that she could hear what others couldn't. Her gait was slightly unsteady due to the wrenched ankle, but it didn't stop her from following that sound.She was way beyond the path at some point, and stopped to listen for the sound... It had stopped. She spoke, then, \"What is it? What do you want from me now?\"Why are you here?\"I was brought here.\" \u00a0 \u00a0You misunderstand the question, child... You've lost sight, haven't you? You let your grief blind you and your anger guide you. You would let your grief blind you and your guilt eat at you until you become bitter. Now why are you here?\"I don't know...\"You don't know because you refuse to open your eyes. Open them and look around you, child. Until you do that, you will never know why you are here. Come back to this place when you have the answer.The voice faded toward the end of that command. Well then. She looked around her and all she could hear was the sound of the forest. She stood with what dignity she had left, and followed her footsteps back toward the path so she could go back toward the group. She was dirt streaked, her hair a mess with leaves and twigs poking out here and there, her skirt was torn here and there, her hose were useless by that point... She stopped to pick up the fallen items on her way toward the clearing.If they hadn't come looking for her by now (strong if), she would stop at the edge of the clearing and gaze out at it. It was just a field of flowers. There was no significance for it, no rhyme or reason other than to house various flora and fauna. Nothing more, nothing less. And Blake? He wasn't Evrand and nor could he ever be, but he was, nevertheless, significant and it was a normal feeling to have to want to substitute in such a way, even if a fleeting thought... Perhaps there was a reason for the feelings she felt, even if they weren't the ideal. He couldn't control what brought memories crashing back to her.If the group hadn't already walked to close the distance between them, she would walk barefoot toward them with the limping gait. \"I am sorry if I worried you,\" was all she said, then sat down and, as if nothing amiss had happened, and with the final shreds of her dignity still intact, she pulled a total princess and nonchalantly pulled her boots on with eyebrows raised and such, smoothing back her hair afterwards and clearing her throat.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "There was something she wished to say to him as well.

This land had been very confusing so far. When he had first come to it he had been stopped at a strange stone building. It was filled with men wearing armor made of metal! Such a dizzying display of power had left him speechless. Then they had shoved bits of a strange material covered in little squiggles at him. They told him to read and sign. He did not know these words and told them so. The human looked at him very annoyed and then hit him with a barrage of questions. He had answered as best he could and then they gave him more strange material. He was told they were \"Travel Papers\" and told that he should not lose them. Bewildered and confused he had then been shown out.

That every elf had a metal spear they could call their own. That our magics were strong enough to protect us. At least until the darkness came. What exactly it was we do not know, that information was lost. All we know is that the Last King and his Queen gave their lives so our ancestors could escape. They fled from what was called Veldara until they came to new lands. Those lands were harsh and cruel and our people lost much of what they knew.

Years passed I was prepared for my role. I was given the armor of the Last King, his spear, and his sword. The only relics besides the tapestry we have left of our home. I was trained by our finest hunters and keenest minds until I was their peer or their better. I was taught to lead, to show compassion, to put the well being of my people above all else. I was ready but there was no Queen. The prophecy cannot be fulfilled without her.

Hood hiding her swollen face so none in the city could see that she'd had a sound beating for having been gone without \"permission\" or escort. She'd even been locked in her room and had to climb out the window, which would explain the breeches she wore. It was probable about dawn by the time she reached the bridge, panting as she slowed from the near run she had taken to get there and the fact her ribs were bruised.

She didn't even recognize the greedy man before her, who now stood with face mottled and red, and hand raised, primed to strike.Her expression stopped the action, however, and he stormed out, slamming the door shut and locking it behind him. She had already gathered her things before the encounter, so it was easy to get things together. Belle sat down heavily, using the arm that look the least amount of defense hits and easing the pack from her back. She pulled out the bag of holding and rummaged with the same hand until she found a healing potion, opened the vial and downed the bitter contents so she could rid herself of physical pain.
