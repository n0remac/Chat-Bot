It's home to Baba Ilya, the tallest and skinniest witch of the forest. It's said that if you leave your window open on a moonless night, she'll tiptoe over to your house and steal your cat. Nobody knows whether or not this is true, but everyone\u00a0knows not to leave their windows open. She has a pet stork, which can occasionally be seen stealing babies.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/ZyVyMwb.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ZyVyMwb.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}}
