Along the walls are some framed pictures of the Zeidler Family. Pictures of different generations, Iban's father and uncle and their father before them, and the current generation. There are many individual pictures of his children when they were young. In a family picture, the full family of Mom and Dad with their 6 children, 3 boys and 3 girls.Skarlet takes the picture and walks toward Iban, looking at the picture she can see one of the girls closely resembles her, it must be C\u00e9line. \"This is a picture of your family monsieur?

Oui, that is my family: Celia my wife, My eldest children Ranis and Valera, The middle children Anton and Analise, and then the youngest, C\u00e9line and Silas.\" In the picture, Ranis appeared to be the oldest at 20 and Valera at 18, Anton was 17 while Analise was 13, then C\u00e9line looked to be 6 while Silas is 5.

Ranis was still relaxing outside on the bench, feeling the rainy breeze.Skarlet walks to the kitchen and sees a mirror, it's a good thing this man is blind, not only would he notice certain features about her, but he'd also see that she doesn't have a reflection. Skarlet places her hands on the boiling kettle so that she can absorb some heat into her hands and backs up. She looks over to notice the old man having trouble searching for the extra cups. \"Here, I will help you monsieur.\"Skarlet places a warm hand on Iban's shoulder and reaches up to grab the cups needed. \"Ah, Merci.

Knowing that she\u2019d be the only one having any issue with the darkness, Naoki doesn\u2019t speak of it, but rather reaches into the pouch on her hip, extracts a small bit of amber, and directs a small amount of magic into it, causing it to glow softly- just enough for Naoki to navigate by.

Ostensibly, they\u2019re simply spending the time indoors, waiting for the storm to pass, and don\u2019t have much of an agenda.

This is because the Threshold is considered sacred, as for when you carry a bride through the threshold.

Sitting there on the couch, sipping her tea, Naoki follows these developments with her swiveling ears, ingesting and digesting the information as it comes. The first thing that Naoki wonders is if Skarlet and Ranis have a similar sort of \u2018aura\u2019 that Iban is picking up on. On the one hand, it\u2019s plausible in that he mistook Skarlet for Ranis. On the other, Ranis was standing there on the porch at the time.

Iban\u2019s postulations, having met with the man before, strike Naoki as not particularly probable. With the understanding that Ranis is almost certainly a vampire of considerable capabilities at this point, Skarlet\u2019s question about simply killing Iban is a valid one- Naoki thinks that if he wanted to, he would have by this point.

She really ought to say something, she supposes, but in a rare turn of events, finds herself at a loss for words. Without knowing the truth of the matter, Naoki finds herself ill-equipped to attempt to comfort or placate Iban.
