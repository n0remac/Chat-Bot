For Nox particularly the quarters were somewhat cramped on the ship, and his size along with the amount of food needed to sustain him did not make the voyage very cheap at all for Nara. However, she wouldn't even dream of leaving her animal companions behind just because it might cost a bit more (quite a bit more) to travel with them on a boat.\u00a0Besides, she had come to Gauldin to finally pursue a career in professional killing, to put it simply. Not just hunting animals, but humans in combat. There was a fight to be had here in Gauldin, so she heard, so she came eager to test out a whole variety of things she had learned over the years for real. Having a saber-toothed tiger around definitely helped with these pursuits, and Thea did as well in a lot of cases, surprisingly. The owl's talons were quite good at gouging eyes from above.\u00a0Anyways, Nara would come up on the Foreign Legion Camp's perimeter soon enough, mounted upon the back of her saber-toothed tiger. Nox was a saber-toothed tiger from the Land Tillers State and surrounding regions, a variety of the species that grew large enough to be a mount. Still, it was quite uncommon to see anyone mounted upon such a ferocious beast. The Snapdragon clan was known for their uncommon affinity with wildlife, though.She wore leather armor as usual, but this armor in particular was plated with steel in various places, making it quite formidable. She also carried a metal helm, simply enough and open-faced to allow her to have better vision. She wasn't wearing it at the moment though. She had a long bow with her, as well as a quiver of arrows, as well as a multitude of daggers and knives, most hidden on her person. Along with this she also carried a pair of blades that were quite uncommon in Gauldin for the most part, a katana and a wakizashi. The pair of blades were commonly referred to as a Daisho in the place they originated from.Nara would dismount from her Saber-toothed tiger then, and Thea would swoop down to perch on her shoulder as she walked up to whatever guards were posted there at the entrance. Nox would follow closely behind her, the large cat sniffing curiously at one of the guards.Nara herself seemed rather disinterested, \"I am here to join the Foreign Legion, where should I go for that?\" she said to the nearest guard.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Traveling to Gauldin had been quite the experience for Nara, as well as Nox and Thea, her saber-toothed tiger and owl.
