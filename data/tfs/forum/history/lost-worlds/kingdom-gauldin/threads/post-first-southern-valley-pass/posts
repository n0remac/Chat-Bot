Internally, he was saddened at the living noble words, even here the art of necromancy is used by the evil. It seems that no where is safe from it. Valabrine also understood why the noble, and by extension his kingdom, was wary of his people. His assumption where correct, his people had been used as a tool long ago to murder and kill and that was Belrow's greatest burden. The diplomat decided that it was best to be completely honest with the royal, this was the only chance his people was going to get. Leaning forward he placed both his hands lightly on the table and spoke.\u00a0\"You are correct. Our people... have been used ...long ago to do evil things.

It is the burden... of full sentience, your people say... the dead can't tell tales... but I assure you, we can.\"He raised his left hand up to his face, staring at the nobleman through his dried husks of his fingers and in a quick move, ripped his left index finger off with his right hand. Holding the finger in his right hand, presenting it to the king Valabrine spoke again. \"I do not ... feel pain, I do not feel ... anything. I don't feel ... the wind on my face, nor the ... sun on my flesh. I can not taste, nor do I... \u00a0need to sleep or drink or eat. My mind ... will effectively live for ever. Some would see all these ... things as a blessing. We see it ... as a curse. In our culture, necromancy is ... strictly controlled, only the higher nobles are ... allowed to practice it, and only ... when it is most needed. We do not ... want anyone to be as we are.\"He then placed his dismembered finger back into the wiggling stump on his left hand, where it firmly reattached. Closing his hands into a fist, he lowered them down again.\u00a0\"We where once... a tool yes.

If Renaux shares the others disdain for the undead, he hides it better. When the diplomat finishes the king rests his hands upon the table. He takes in a deep breath and say's in a measured voice.<br><br/>\"I will not pretend to know a great deal about your kingdom. What I do know is why we are being cautious about your presence here. I also will not pretend to have heard much about your kingdom. What I have heard is why I agreed to this meeting. The practice of necromancey is strictly regulated in Gauldin. The reason is simple, it is a favored tool of tyrants. Prolonging their own life unnaturally and giving them an army that can't die. Using the dead to kill, tortue, and enslave the living. Gauldin has suffered under such evil men in the past.\"<br/><br/>The king pauses and takes a breath folding his hands in front of him.<br/><br/>\"However, I did say it was a tool. Like any tool what it is used for depends partly on the hand that wields it. Some think that a tool is blameless that is not entirely the case though. A sword is a tool, but it has a use it is best suited for. Similarly those who are proffecient in using swords tend to be a specific sort. Do you understand what I am saying?\"<br/><br/>He gives Valabrine a moment to consider his words before he continues.<br/><br/>\"You come to me as emissary of a kingdom whose life blood is a magic, a <i>tool</i> best suited to killing. You come from this kingdom and make overtures of peace and friendship. I am willing to listen diplomat, but you need to make me believe. Convince me this is not a trick, a ploy to get our gates open, to lure us into a false sense of security for a future attack.\" <div class=\"quote_clear\"></div></br></div></div>"}, "post-36567": {"user": "King Renaux of Trav\u00e9re", "user_num": 889, "timestamp": "1462546130000", "message": "(I just want to apologize for how long my response are taking.

He went into his more primal survival mode, quickly scouting the immediate area for anyone or anything that could cause him any trouble in the night.

A rustling sound nearby woke him in a hurry, quickly jumping to his feet and readying his claws he crouched down ready to pounce. One hooded figure came jumping out of the bushes at him, sword swinging before he came into sight, Drakken only had time to quickly roll out of the way. To bad for him he rolled straight into the grasp of another hooded figure, the mans scent caught his attention immediately. A memory stirred, a happy day with his family, his birthday, quickly it all descended into chaos, men had found them, one had him caught but his father fought back, Drakken ran, fires raged all around him. That was the last he saw of his parents. But now, this smell, the way this man held him, it was the same one.Drakkens rage took control of him, his mind went blank as he jumped back, pushing the man into a tree and releasing his grip on him. \"WHAT DID YOU DO TO THEM?!\" He yelled at the hurt man on the ground. His failure to remain aware got the better of him, a sword sliced across his back. Blood began to pour down his back as he struggled to remain standing. He fell to one knee as the sword wielder move his side and raised his sword. \"Another trophy for me then.\" He said with a sadistic chuckle. He didn't know what happened next, all he remembered was a red hot rage filling his body, pointing his hand up at the sword wielder he imagined his rage pouring out at him. All he could hear was screaming, the man was rolling on the floor, fire had taken to his entire body, that and some of the surrounding trees.The screaming ceased as the other figure ran off back into the night, Drakkens body felt weak. The sword had left a nasty wound on his back, blood still coming out of it, and whatever he had just done had taken a toll on his body, his mind dulled and he couldn't move, all he felt he could do was lie there and wait to either bleed out or the other man to come back and finish the job.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The sky was darkening as Drakken walked through the pass.
