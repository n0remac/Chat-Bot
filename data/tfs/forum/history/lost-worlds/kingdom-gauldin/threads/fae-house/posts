He didn't want me to live the same life he had. He put his own marriage on hold for four years, to pay my way through the academy. Just so I would never have to see blood shed.\"He pauses and smiles a sad little smile.\"Of course I didn't find that out till much later. I was actually mad at him for not letting me do what I wanted. Anyway I moved to Trav\u00e9re and spent four years in the academy. My father died in my final year and my brother became Baron of Attisburg. I returned to the farm and found it too small for my liking. By that time I had learned how to disguise cleverness with wit and charm. I was enamored of the city and decided I would stay there.
