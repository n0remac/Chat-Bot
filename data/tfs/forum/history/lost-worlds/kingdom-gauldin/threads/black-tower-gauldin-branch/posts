The compound's main building is a well defended fortress that only features one main entrance. Although there are other ways in and out of the building, they are not readily apparent unless one knows where they are located. There are a number of enclosed bridges that connect the various towers from the various buildings together, each with heavily reinforced doors in them allowing a building to be quarantined off if needed.The compound itself is located so that its back and sides are to mountains. The front is only accessible from a bridge that passes over a rather deep ravine. This means in general, all who wish to reach it must use the bridge as the other options for reaching it are quite dangerous. Although lightly staffed compared to the other branch, there are still a number of guards as well as a few dwarven workers who live at it as well as the necessary scribes and clerks.It should be noted that all buildings in the compound are made of the same reinforced runed stone that the Black Tower in Isra is made of. This gives it a number of capabilities when channeled by mages as well as boosted durability. Inspector Osvald is the operator of this branch, seeing to its day to day procedures. It is suspected he keeps in close contact with the other branches, insuring info is shared between them.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/aDJjCWs.jpg"], "html": "<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/aDJjCWs.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/></p>"}, "post-22277": {"user": "The Starlight Dawn", "user_num": 813, "timestamp": "1454387732000", "message": "At the order of Madame Naoki, the staff of The Gauldish Black Tower Branch prepare themselves to receive the comatose Demonlord.

The walls of polished stone stretch upwards, engraved with complex runes all the way to the top. The ceiling, floor, and room itself are otherwise featureless, and only a single narrow door sits centered on one of the walls. Just inside this door, a single uniformed attendant stands expectantly, eyes on the far wall. As she watches, the runes on the walls begin to glow. At first, a deep midnight blue, that gradually increases in hue and intensity as it spreads across the walls. She shields her eyes with the back of her hand as the magic continues to spread, eventually intensifying into an incredibly bright, sky blue blaze. As the glow reaches its climax, it abruptly terminates with a loud CRACK, immediately leaving the room in almost complete darkness. Presently, the runic light sources re-activate, and reveal the presence of exactly twenty individuals who hadn\u2019t been in the room before. They are a many and varied lot, including Empress Naoki , Artemis , Queen Arianne , Lady Genevieve St. James, Odette, Royal Fletcher, Ravven Fletcher, and thirteen assorted Isranian Embassy members. They all stand roughly spaced in a grid, each at least two meters from the next individual over. Some carry bags, and one Embassy member in particular holds a large crate neatly filled with carefully rolled scrolls. Madame Naoki stands in the leftmost position in the front row, and carries a singular, finely made bag of black cloth. It fastens with a golden clasp in the shape of the Isranian Sun Insignia, and has a label, in both common and Gauldish, embroidered just below it.Diplomatic BagValise DiplomatiqueBeyond this bag, Madame Naoki is also carrying a silver box under one arm, containing her gown. The majority of her luggage had been sent ahead, but this garment, only acquired yesterday, had missed that trip. Though the ride had been a highly stimulating one, some traces of drowsiness still cling to her. She blinks several times as the turns to the left, surveying her group. Examining each of them in turn, she determines that there have been no teleportation accidents; all of her party is present, all of their limbs are in the right spots, and nobody is screaming in agony. Excellent. Naoki never really was one for the whole screaming thing. With everything in order, she starts for the door, leading the way through the short tunnel into the next room. The attendant, after confirming everything had gone smoothly, preceded Naoki into the room, and now stands behind a small desk. The room is otherwise rather unremarkable. The walls are paneled with wood and illuminated by sconces, and the floor and ceiling are the same polished stone as the previous entry. The only other piece of furniture, excluding the desk, is a small padded stool, upon which the attendant sits perkily. Naoki shuffles into the room, and stops before the desk, something about drowsinessThe attendant chimes up perkily, \u201cName, please!\u201dNaoki fixes her with a deadly glare, the irritation she would normally experience compounded by her lack of sleep. Far too early in this particular morning, she was in the mood for neither perkiness nor bureaucracy. The attendant flinches, and immediately sets to work on the paperwork. \u201cYes, Madame.\u201dAfter a few short minutes and a handful of signatures, Naoki\u2019s travel documents are complete, and she is prepared to legally enter the nation of Gauldin. The attendant bundles them together into a scroll, and stamps the break with a wax seal of Gauldin\u2019s fleur-de-lis seal. She offers the bundle of documents to Naoki, who receives it, and places it in the pocket of her jacket. She nods to the attendant, and turns as if to leave before remembering. Returning to the desk, she places one hand over the attendant\u2019s own, and leans in close, speaking softly, words edged with steel.\u201cListen to me. You are not to speak of any individual who may or may not pass through here as part of my group. Not to anyone. Under any circumstances. You admitted Madame Naoki and her Embassy, but not a soul more. This is a matter of national security, and you should feel compelled by your duty to your country to do as I say, and speak not a word of this. Do you understand me?\u201dThe attendant springs to attention and attempts to salute with her right arm, but finds it still held under Naoki\u2019s hand on the desk. Realizing what she intends, Naoki releases it, and it flies up to smack the attendant in the eye. She winces, but snaps into a salute regardless, albeit with one eye clenched shut. \u201cYes, Madame Ambassador! Only the Embassy, you got it!\u201d Naoki nods, satisfied, and turns to leave, speaking back over her shoulder at the attendant.\u201cGood. Don\u2019t forget; this is a matter of the utmost importance.\u201dWithout any further parting words, Naoki exits through the opposite door, and finds herself in the next room. It is something of a ready-room, the walls are adorned with standard issue armor and weaponry of The Black Tower. In the event that reinforcements need to be brought in from afar, this room would see them armed before joining the defense. However, seeing as Naoki has no need of the room\u2019s supplies, she instead plops herself on one of the many benches running the length of the room, setting the silver box to one side, still holding the Diplomatic Bag in her left hand. She glances around the room, but finds no amusement in the rows of armor along the walls. It would be another few minutes before Artemis gets in, and probably something resembling a half hour before everyone is cleared and they could proceed. She should have had more border officers allocated. Naoki considers taking a nap, but decides against it- the benches aren\u2019t terribly soft. She ruminates for a short time on how only a few years ago, she would have been immensely satisfied to sleep anywhere as clean as this, and how now, she can hardly find restful sleep even in her old bed at The Sun, when compared to the cloud-like perfection of the large four-poster at the Chalet. How decadent she\u2019s becoming. However, thoughts of her own decline only entertain her for a few short minutes. No sounds indicative of the next entrant of the room make themselves heard down the hall. She sighs with exasperation, and casts her eyes around once again. This time, they settle on the silver box sitting to her immediate left. Her eyebrows raise as she transfers the Diplomatic Bag to the interior of her jacket and places the silver box upon her lap. Madame Naoki was unable able to satisfy her initial curiosity regarding the gown in the events immediately following yesterday\u2019s trip to the Boutique, nor had she time to this morning, having only barely woken up in time to dress herself and get into the carriage on time. Now she has some time on her hands, and thinks it high time to have a look. She fumbles for a moment with the latches, her dexterity having not fully arrived yet, before managing to open the hinging lid of the box, revealing the garment within. \u201c... a deep cabernet colour, created to outline the curves of your torso and flow freely from your hips and elbows...\u201dThough she isn\u2019t able to see the full extent of the gown, folded as it is in the box, the ornamentation around the neckline is presented prominently facing upward, and it is evident that the rest of the garment\u2019s elegance is in the cut, no additional patterning exists. Almost immediately, the magic reaches out to her. It feels familiar, and fundamentally right, like a part of her body that has been missing, and now gladly rejoins the fold. This dress was, somehow, inexplicably, made precisely for her. Every fold of the fabric whispers impossible pleasures; mystery and intrigue twine with the very threads.How strange it must be for Genevieve. When she sits down to create a garment, what forces compel her to craft a garment in just such a way as to perfectly suit a specific individual? Does she know the individual for whom the garment is being made for at the time? Or does she have any agency at all in the creation process? Unfolding the garment slightly, Naoki confirms that there is indeed a tail-hole. Such a strange sort of magic. Though the idea of immediately putting it on crosses her mind, and seems quite tempting, the rational portion of Naoki\u2019s mind decides against it. Not only is there a high probability of Queen Arianne coming into the room in the next few moments - and it wouldn\u2019t do to be seen half-naked before her (Not yet, anyway.) - the gown also doesn\u2019t seem like one intended for riding in. There may very well be mud on the roads, and if the gown gets dirty on the ride over, she wouldn\u2019t be able to wear it into the palace. And, she decides, she would very much like  to see how the royalty and nobility of Gauldin react to her in this garment. Silently thanking Genevieve, she carefully shuts the lid, latching the box shut again. Significantly more awake and satisfied than before, she replaces the box to her right on the bench, and takes the Diplomatic Bag back into her direct grasp. Visions of flustered nobility and facilitated diplomacy grace the forefront of Naoki\u2019s mind as she sits patiently on the bench, waiting for the next individual to join her in the waiting room.

As the rest of the group files in, she remains on her seat, sitting quietly, thinking ahead, remembering her notes. As the final member of the Embassy enters, she stands, and speaks loudly, intending to interrupt any conversations that may be taking place and address the entirety of her group. \u201cAhem! Welcome to Gauldin, everyone. Now that we all have our travel papers, we can proceed. Just beyond that door, there\u2019s a platform. It moves vertically with an advanced sort of motion magic. We\u2019re going to file onto it in an orderly way, and remain calm and composed as it takes us up to the surface. From there, we\u2019re going to proceed to the stables, get our horses, and immediately depart for Travere. If any of you have any issues you should voice them now, and use the designated restroom as we\u2019re preparing the horses, should you require. Once we leave, we\u2019re going to travel in formation at speed, and take exactly one break at the midpoint of our journey. Please listen to the commands of the guards, and follow their instructions calmly and swiftly, especially in the event of any altercation on the road. Any questions?\u201dAfter waiting a moment for any questions, and nodding with satisfaction when none are raised, Naoki leads the way onto the elevator, and continues to instruct the group on proper elevator etiquette as they spend a few minutes ascending to the surface. The elevator deposits them inside the primary headquarters building of The Black Tower, though not much can be seen, only spotless hallways and closed doors. Naoki continues to lead the party through the halls, and out a side door, leading almost directly to The Stables. The Stables do indeed warrant capitals. Seeing as how this Gauldish branch of The Black Tower is situated in a roughly central location, and must be prepared to respond to activities anywhere with Gauldin, mounts are paramount in maintaining swift response times. The Stables are a many and sizeable lot, and a great variety of creatures can be seen as Naoki leads the group along a neatly paved path through the buildings. One stable is dedicated to Isra\u2019s great griffons, another holds a small handful of wyvern, restrained by metal bars. In another building, apparently bars were not enough, the entire enclosure is made of the same dark stone as the titular Black Tower. Though no rumblings can be heard, and the building is completely sealed, one must imagine that it holds some manner of terribly large and dangerous beast. However, Naoki leads the group past all of these stables, all the way to the end of the line, where the horses are held. The horse stable is relatively tame, when compared to the others, but is still a large and well-maintained facility. Rows upon rows of box stalls and multiple sets of double doors along each side of the building provide for a large complement of animals, many of whom can be seen milling about in the large open yard in the back.As they approach, one of the stable staff detach from their duties, and approach the group. He is a somewhat short, yet sturdy man wearing a well worn pair of leather breeches and a simple woolen shirt, and sporting a short beard. Naoki raises a hand to signal the group to stop as he approaches, and indicates that they should gather around to hear what he has to say. After waiting a moment for the group to settle, he bows, and introduces himself. \u201cHello, everyone. I\u2019m Louis, stable master for Black Tower. I\u2019ll be giving you use of some of our best mounts today, so please follow me, and we\u2019ll see you horsed.\u201dHis voice is rough, and tinted with a heavy helping of rural Gauldish accent. He beckons the group into the stable through one set of doors. As they enter, individuals in the group may notice a number of heavily armored horses being led out of another door by a collection of equally armored individuals. Louis leads the group a short ways into the interior of the stable, to a grouping of group of stabled horses separated from the rest in their own small section. There are perhaps thirty five horses, all said and done, spread between as many individual box stalls. If one were to inspect them, they would find each horse well groomed, shoed, and pre-saddled. \u201cThese lot are yours. They\u2019re all fast and reliable, but they\u2019ve each got their own unique spirit, so go ahead and pick out the one that calls to you.\u201dLouis approaches one of the box stalls, containing a somewhat short gray courser,  and demonstrates how to open the stall. Lift the latch, pull the bar, open the gate. Stepping inside, he leads the horse out by the reins, and passes them off to Madame Naoki. She receives them, pats the horse once on the side of the neck, and addresses the rest of the group. \u201cYou heard him, pick a horse. Lead it out of the stable by the reigns and mount it outside. We\u2019ll get into formation and depart once we\u2019re all mounted. If you haven\u2019t ridden before, or have some issue, speak to Louis.\u201dWith this, Naoki proceeds to lead her horse outside, mount it, and take a position in a small staging area, leaving the remainder of the group to choose their horses and follow. Louis stands attentively off to one side, prepared to assist or answer questions.

It is fine to strike down an evil if they give you no other choice. However, you must always give evil the chance at redemption. I know it seems like this Zephidel is irredeemable as though he deserves to be killed. You should not do so though. It is not our place to decide who should live and who should die. Our power must be used to defend people not to punish them. If the populace of Medan is suffering under Zephidel's rule then we must act, this is true. Still war must not be our first choice, it must be our last resort. Come to me child we have much to discuss in person and I need your help.
