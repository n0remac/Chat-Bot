The Godmother may have been pretty before, but now she looks positively stunning. Even the hyenas look good, and that's really saying something. The godmother snaps her fingers again, and a man comes in with a large crate. Within a minute, he has unpacked and set up a small alchemy lab.

Ukufa pulled out some herbs from his own supply, but then put them away. \"Heheheh HAHAHAHA!\" The drug was starting to have an effect. \"Oh what a marvelous creature you are. I hesitate. Should I cure myself so quickly or should I wait to see what this does? Ehehehehe HAHAHAHA! If only you knew, if only! Eeeeeehehehehehe... Let's seeeeee nowww...\" He examined the alchemy kit. Indeed it had everything he needed. Curing a drug overdose was relatively simple. First, one would have to take an oral emetic. He had his own, but also identified an herb and some salt water in the alchemy kit. After sniffing the herb, he mixed it and the salt water together, making three doses. He swallowed one and gave the other two to his hyenas. He smiled for a bit before spontaneously throwing up, releasing most of the fairy dust from his system. He couldn't get over his amusement though at how sparkly the vomit was. Likewise the hyenas vomited out their meal. They were less amused.That alone would more than likely assure his survival. However, he figured why take any chances and used the alchemy kit to produce a nice anti-stimulant to mitigate the potentially negative side-effects of the drug. He worked so quickly and smoothly the whole process took less than 4 minutes.\"Hehehehe... heh heh heh... a wonderful diversion.
