Any who have been in that part of the woods before might notice it as a new structure - and indeed, it is a recent addition. Erected via strong magic, the modest yet sturdy tower is the chosen home of the newest Librarian and Book Restoration Expert of the Royal Academy of the Arcane, a sorceress by name of Reuna Midai. It is here that the sorceress chooses to dwell, one of its interior doors linked to her \"dormitory\" (in truth, her office) within the Academy itself, allowing her to travel between her home and work with ease. The tower is surrounded by defensive wards designed to keep out intruders and hostile individuals, but those who approach with peaceful intent will be allowed entry, assuming the owner is home. Upon entering, one sees a collection of spaces seemingly too large for what the exterior allows.

If only he could do something she couldn't.When Reuna wasn't looking, Gavin stared at where he knew the scars on her wrists were. He had no understanding of the implications of those scars. But instead he wondered why a great sorceress like Auntie Reuna couldn't heal them herself? Of course, scars took quite a bit of magic to heal and sometimes weren't worth the effort. Some people felt iffy about their scars, treating them as part of their identity. This presented a psychological barrier for the would-be healer. And heck, some people took pride in their scars...Of course, Gavin didn't know any of this. Rather recklessly, he began to stare at Reuna's scar, focusing his little mind. He didn't expect anything to actually happen though.Would Reuna notice when the smallest of her scars disappeared? Would she sense the itching sensation or the slight trace of mana?

He thought it fitting to give you his old broadsword as a token of appreciation.Sincerely,Elder HavadorThe package did indeed contain a rather simple looking, though well-crafted broadsword.Despite its humble appearance, Reuna would sense a friendly presence about the sword.

That thought ripped at her heart in such a way that she knew it was a pain she'd never recover from.

Especially if you ever decide you'd like to be younger than you are now. That will be a very awkward conversation for me I think. Not that I am saying you should want to be younger.
