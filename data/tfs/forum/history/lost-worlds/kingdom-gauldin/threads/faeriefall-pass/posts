A serene and nearly undisturbed location, it holds little strategic value and is nearly devoid of useful resources save timber, and so has been ignored by the Gauldish government for the most part. As such, there are no settlements, only the occasional trapper or hiker travelling through the area. Sturdy black oak bridges have been built along gaps between narrow footpaths overlooking the great river that flows out into the sea beyond, giving a glorious view of the range's natural beauty. No one knows who carved the paths or built the bridges, seemingly done by machinations beyond current understanding given their timeless sturdiness. The paths have been here for eons, and yet the bridges never decay, the paths never erode. Truly a mystery for the ages.Manticores, wild Pegasi, sprites, wisps, and all manner of other naturally magical beasts travel these paths, making it slightly more dangerous than it at first appears, yet also more mysterious and beautiful than one could possibly imagine. At night, the firmament is clear and filled with streaking rivers of twinkling starlight, passing slowly overhead as they continue their drift toward the horizon. The great river below mirrors its skyward cousins, twinkling with a mysterious light. None have ever been able to explain the sparkling cyan lights that flit back and fourth within the pure river water, making it all the more magically stunning.In the highest reaches of the mountain overlooking the river there lies a hot spring which legends describe as magical. Allegedly, it is guarded by a great, ancient, undying beast who prevents all but the most pure of heart from entering, lest they meat fates at its deadly claws. The spring is said to grant eternal life and prosperity, its waters imbued with an ancient and forgotten pre-Cataclysmic magic. All in all, this is a haven for the magical and mysterious, and most who venture here come back awed by the experience...or not at all.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/28/61/02/28610217fd77e472c06c1b062bcb7267.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/28/61/02/28610217fd77e472c06c1b062bcb7267.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}, "post-33735": {"user": "Vaelar Black", "user_num": 609, "timestamp": "1461015003000", "message": "Having taken the six month journey by boat into Gauldin to negotiate a particularly important pact with its leadership, Vaelar finds himself weary of discussion and debate.

It feels as if it's been weeks since Vaelar has gotten any time away from business, so he's going to make the most of this trip with his love.Packing supplies and shelter allowing for a week of survival in the untamed wilds is a quick enough process, and Vaelar sets off for the Faeriefall Mountain Pass upon his destrier, Jun sat before him upon his lap and Blackbean perched upon the horse's haunches. A light, compact wagon is pulled by the war horse behind the trio, filled with supplies. The horse trots along a path along the edge of the mountain, carved into the stone by unknown forces, smooth and clearly unnatural. Below lies a great expanse of forest, bacjed by a great snowcapped mountain, a wide river flowing between the two natural features. It would be a long way down if they were to fall, but the view is gorgeous, only enhanced by the pure azure sky and brightly shining sun. Despite the narrowness of the clifftop path they're currently traveling on, Vaelar seems unconcerned, his focus entirely on the adorable woman in his lap.\"Mm, a lovely day, is it not?\" he asks, wrapping his arms about her midsection as he drops the reins and lets the horse find its own path. He squeezes her tight to him, placing a light kiss upon the top of her head as she's squeezed into his hard, muscular body, her head upon his bare chest. He decided to go mostly natural, forgoing a tunic or boots in favour of simply wearing a pair of roughspun trousers to make himself mostly decent. Despite the chilly mountain breeze, he seems unbothered, and his body emanates enough warmth for the both of them.", "link_list": ["/user/108"], "image_list": [], "html": "Having taken the six month journey by boat into Gauldin to negotiate a particularly important pact with its leadership, Vaelar finds himself weary of discussion and debate.

With one hand, Vaelar whips out a large, checkered quilt from his pack and lays it out before him, tenderly placing Jun down upon its soft material with his other arm, demonstrating extreme balance and deftness.\"Wait here a moment, my dear,\" he says with a slight grin before turning about and dashing over to the cart. After a few moments of rummaging, he returns with a wicker basket full of foodstuffs, from soft rye bread baked only a few hours ago, roasted quail still warm to the touch, a full honeyed ham, and two blackened chicken breasts. Beneath it all sits a magically cooled bottle of Medanese Gold, an extraordinarily rare vintage given the lack of goods leaving Medan, and unopened at that. Beside it, two crystal glasses have been placed delicately under a set of thick cloths, cushioning them for travel.Vaelar places the basket down in the centre of the quilt and sits down beside Jun, placing a hand comfortably upon her thigh as he peels back the cloth covering the foodstuffs.\"Hungry, sweetling?\" he asks, smiling over at her.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Vaelar grins against Jun's hair, breathing in its natural aphrodisiac qualities with a contented sigh.
