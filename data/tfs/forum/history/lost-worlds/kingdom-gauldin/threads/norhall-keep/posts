It is about 9'x5' and has a large table in the center, surrounded by chairs. This room is also used as a ball room, for events such as weddings and feasts. Four bedrooms surround the main hall: two to the north that share a wash room, one on the southeastern side, and one on the southwestern side. On the northeastern side is a smaller dining hall, where council meetings will be held, and off of that there is a kitchen. On the east side of the keep is the armory, where weapons and armor for the knights and soldiers of the region are stored. To the north of that is the chapel, where services for the young knights and members of their families are held, and directly next to that is the chamber of the knights Gerulf and Alaric Oakenheart.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "As you enter the small castle owned by the Oakenheart family, you first arrive in the main hall.
