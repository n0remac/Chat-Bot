Maybe that was just her, though? Regardless, she was still strolling along as he commented on her appearance.

Who's looking for Jamis Volreaux?\" He was a tall man, muscular and angry-looking, with a scar on his cheek and freshly-bloodied knuckles. Feru drew herself up, eyeing the man. She wasn't impressed.\"Me. Are you him?\"The man sneered, cracking his knuckles threateningly. \"Oui, little cat, I am Jamis Volreaux.

Except I'm gonna guess by your messed up hands that you're in the habit of layin' into innocent women with your fists.

Planting Meatwhacker's tip into the floorboards, she leaned the sword up against the nearby wall, and flashed Syros a beaming grin. \"Watch that for me, wouldja?\" Sprinting across the floor at top speed, Feru launched her fist up into the big man's chin. When he staggered, she darted behind him and up onto his back, dealing two blows to his ears. When he reached up  to grasp his now-ringing head, she dropped, and dealt a roundhouse kick to the backs of his knees. He crumpled, making it quite easy for her to walk around in front of him. Those jaden hues peered coldly into his as she spoke, her voice calm. \"Now. You're gonna stay away from the lord and the little lady, got me? If I hear about ya not doin' as I say, I'll come back, and turn ya into a eunuch.\"Satisfied with the man's wide-eyed stare, she dealt him a quick, vicious blow to the solar plexus, and broke his nose with another rapid-fire punch, before turning away.

Then he began to speak. With every word that came from him, she grew more tense, her eyes more wide. When he moved to sit up, she pulled away from him and shifted until she was sitting with her legs curled beneath her, completely uncaring of her nudity when the sheet pooled around her hips.<br><br/><font color=\"993300\">\"..Woah, wait a second, lemme just.. get this straight. You.. you want a.. <i>relationship</i>? With <i>me</i>? No sleepin' with other people.. sharin' a bed.. livin' together..? With.. <i>feelings</i> and stuff?\"</font> Her tail fluffed as she shuddered at the word 'feelings'. Feru didn't <i>do</i> all that domestic shit. She never had. She'd always been the love-'em-and-leave-'em type. Rarely did she ever sleep with the same person more than once, and the last time she'd done that had been when she was actively traveling with the person in question. Sliding hastily out of the bed before he could reach for her, she began to gather her clothes and yank them on, her tail lashing wildly behind her.<br/><br/><font color=\"993300\">\"Listen, last night was great. Best time I've ever had. But..\"</font> Suddenly, she stopped, with her leggings on and her shirt in her hands, staring at the wall. She had been hit with the abrupt realization that she hadn't been upset by his words; she felt no panic, no anger, no disgust. Just.. fear. Fear of the unknown. Uncertainty if she could even <i>be</i> in a relationship like that. To change her ways? To become a one man kind of cat-woman, even just temporarily? She turned toward him, her emotions easily visible on her face as she clutched the shirt anxiously against her chest. <font color=\"993300\">\"..I don't do relationships. I never have. But.. but I'm.. I'm willin' to try. With you.\"</font> She looked so unsure of herself, shuffling her feet as her ears flicked and swiveled. </br></font>"}, "post-24776": {"user": "Syros", "user_num": 1087, "timestamp": "1456194433000", "message": "Syros listened to her, choosing to hide any reaction he had until she had finally finished her reply.

Slowly, just as unconcerned about his nudity as she was, he pulled the covers away from his form and then slid his legs from the end of the bed and stood. He groaned, his shoulders popping a little as he raised his hands up above his head ad gave a loud yawn.\"We can take it slow, don't worry. I do want to sleep with you again though... Share a bed with you at night. But you're right, we shouldn't do that now if we must return to your home with haste,\" he explained, then slowly took his items of clothing and re-dressed himself for the journey ahead.\u00a0\"I'm ready to go whenever you are.\"He turned to look at her, his eyes tasting her own, then the face in which they sat and the body he had enjoyed only hours before. He stepped in, then rather suddenly wrapped his arms around her in a big hug. He held it for a few seconds, his head over her shoulder and his chest pressed into her face, before releasing and stepping back.\"Let's go,\" he said, making his way out of the room.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<font color=\"#7baee9\">Syros listened to her, choosing to hide any reaction he had until she had finally finished her reply.

Back to Bayonne.\" She glanced at Syros as she started down the steps toward the road, and couldn't help a goofy half-smile. Man.
