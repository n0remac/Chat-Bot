Camilla had a thoughtful expression on her face as she gazed at him.A kiss is given, and then she nestled against his side, soon to be asleep...<Fade to DREAM sequence>The breeze blew the leaves into a merry dance and the sounds of the forest came to life. She was a little girl, running free, hair caught on said wind. She was laughing as a dark haired girl came into view. One was gifted with communication with plants and earth, while the other could communicate with the wildlife and tame them. They collapsed in a fit of laughter, onto the side of a hill.The clouds began to roil and become dark, blocking out the sun. Thunder started to sound like timpani among the symphonic rustling of leaves. The wildlife grew quiet in that calm before the storm, ions charging the air with an almost, static like feel.\u00a0The ground began to shift, and the girls who were previously laughing, grew frightened and held each other. The atmosphere took on an ominous red, lightening flashed through the sky and the ground yawned open. The dark haired girl cried out as she dangled helplessly, trying to hold fast to the light haired girl but neither had strength. The girl cried out as her strength gave way and she fell into the newly formed chasm.As the scene grew darker, the remaining girl scrambled to her feet and began to run and run. Another person, a young man with a kind face and sandy hair, came into being in front of her. She was no longer a little girl, but a woman grown. The young man swooped her up and spun her, all was safe again in his arms. But then he stepped back, a pained look on his face and a crimson stain seeping into his shirt. He fell back, things turned slow motion as she tried to reach him, but he couldn't see her now.An older man lay not far behind him, already still in death. She tried to get to them, to run closer, reach out, but they somehow grew further and further away. The sound of Anid's voice reached her, \"I made a mistake, you didn't have what it took to save Verri and you killed your family as sure as if you did it by your own hand.\" Her words were distorting into a creepy bass voice, and demonic sounding laughter sounded. \"You handed the scepter over, traitor.\"She shook her head hard in denial, \"No, they took it from me! And the gems... I didn't kill Evrand OR Hylon! I didn't!\" She cried out. The form of a blue dragon appeared, lightening flashing behind him to create a silhouette of the beast as he rumbled with laughter at her expense... \"Listening to fools will make you a fool. What did you think would happen? You are filled with the downfall of your ancestors ignorance and rash decisions.\"\"What do I do? How do I fix it? Tell me!\"<Outside the dream sequence, coinciding with the scenes in the dream>She was pretty restless, tossing and turning, and eventually rolling off the bed. Lucky for her, she'd at least put a shift on after their ahhh... activities... Because she began to pad out of the room, down the hall and toward the entry to the house itself. The door banged open, and she walked in a zombie-like state in the direction the carriage had taken them the day of the jaunt. It started to rain, a cool and slick rain, and soon, she would be soaked, her hem would be muddy, as would her feet be. It wasn't hard to spot her, obviously, but they would have to find a way to get her to turn around without waking her up...

She place the object on the counter and folded her arms with indignation. \"Yah well, at least I didn't accidentally teleport myself on the roof.\" Cohen took offense to this. \"HEY!

She set the bowl down on the window sill to nibble from and began to braid the garlic so it had time to dry for use. Anyone that might walk in at the moment would be able to see that when yesterday, she wasn't showing, today she was.

It involved at least two dragons, and there was a fair amount of fire involved. \u2026 And by that, I mean that my scouts saw the smoke billowing from miles and miles away, outside the border. \u2026 I would hypothesise that a portion of The Usque was burned down during that battle.\u201d\u201cThe people of Medan\u2026\u201d Naoki trails off, considering for a moment how to best choose her words.\u201cThe people of Medan live, for the most part, but that\u2019s about it. Shortly following the coup, a large group of refugees escaped and made their way to Isra. There, they were received warmly and have since settled in well. However, for those that did not manage to escape, things seem somewhat grim. The new government is- as I hear, highly totalitarian. I have heard secondhand of slavery, unjust imprisonment, and torture. \u2026 The rumors are much worse.\u201d\u201cAdditionally, I am aware that a figure called \u2018Empress Jill\u2019 has replaced Zephidel. I know nothing of her or how she came to power, only that she is currently. If you have any specific questions, or would like me to elaborate\u2026\u201d Naoki shrugs slightly in what she intends to be an apologetic and sympathetic manner.

Croeria was my ancestor and ruled in the land where Verri stood. She received four gems at some point that were all enchanted by the elements, one gem representing each element, and all four together could control the weather and create more prosperity. Eventually greed from surrounding kingdoms caused the castle to be stormed by different armies, they wanted the power. The gems were taken out of the castle by the daughter of Croeria as the castle fell, and the four gems were taken to different points of the map. Somehow the fire gem was recovered and placed on the scepter, and then the scepter caused another war somewhere along the line and was put into a cave into a box only one descendant of Croeria could open. The object in question is unique in that it works to enhance one person's power based on good or evil... If the person is good, only good things happened... And if bad... you have already seen.\" She paused as a flashback flitted through her memory, of the two who trapped her, of their trickery... \"My father... was a good and just man until my mother died along with his only son. He went mad and was easily influenced by unsavory men. He betrothed me to the son of a king who was... corrupt, for lack of a better term. His only agenda was to get the scepter, and he thought my father knew where it was but my father wasn't a descendant of Croeria, my mother was. The kingdom of Verri was lost after I ran away to avoid marriage to the prince, who tried to rape me and would have killed me if I married him. Medan was built upon the ashes of Verri. It was Zephidel who next wanted the scepter...\"Camilla took a deep breath and than said very softly, \"I am the one descendant.\" Believe it or not, that was the story in a nutshell... She didn't repeat the story as she had told Hylon, which would have taken an hour. \"And because I was the one looking for the four gems, I was there when Zephidel's minions found the box and couldn't open it. My memory of that day is hazy at best, but they got the scepter and the next thing I remembered was waking up in Captain Blake's ship, and I had given birth to the children I didn't even remember being pregnant with. I had no memory of my past at all.\"She stood and went to pour herself some water, drank some, and then continued, \"I want you to understand that I don't want vengeance for what was done to my father in law, or my late husband, as much as I want my people freed. Would I be angry if Jill was killed in the process? I would be lying if I said 'aye' to that.\" Her eyes glinted as if relishing the idea of dismembering Jill. \"You see, I took her into my household as one of my Ladies in waiting, and as one of my guards.

And what a tale it is, she muses. The first thing that jumps to mind- and in introspection, Naoki supposes that this is somewhat telling of her character in a less than flattering way- is that the other three gemstones still exist, and that Camilla\u2019s children ought to count as valid descendants for the intention of opening the cases. This thought, however, is quickly dismissed, filed away with the rest of Naoki's darker thoughts.\u00a0The next item that jumps to mind is that 'Goodness, Camilla certainly has had a rough time of things, hasn\u2019t she.' It isn\u2019t as if Naoki is utilising some naive and innocent princess, pampered her whole life and whose foremost concern is the opinion of others. No. Looking up at the other woman with new eyes, Naoki finds a certain\u2026 realness in her. A certain sort of very respectable, down-to-earth quality- which Naoki supposes is something of a pun, given Camilla\u2019s apparent affinity with the earth. Perhaps it\u2019s the manner in which she speaks, or carries herself. Perhaps it\u2019s the grass-stain on her dress, or how pained she seems when the suffering of her people is mentioned. Figuring that it\u2019s some combination of the above, as a reflection of who the woman is, Naoki finds it very easy to see how Jun maintained such a high opinion of this woman and finds herself considering Camilla with a fair amount more respect than she had been previously. But, wait a moment, Jun. Jill was also a lady in waiting of Camilla\u2019s. Jun knows Jill. Turning halfway about to consider Emahra, Naoki poses the question- half to herself and half to the other women in the room, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t Jun mention that she knows Jill...?\u201d\u00a0After puzzling over this for a moment, apparently well and thoroughly at a loss, Naoki figures it prudent to elaborate to Camilla. \u201cAssuming that you and I are speaking of the same Jun, she is currently an associate of mine. A Sun Marshal, like Ms. Untyrid here.\u201d With one hand, Naoki gestures to Emahra\u2019s crimson scarf, making her as a Senior Marshal. \u201cThey are\u2026 special operatives of sorts. Tasked with missions others would not be able to adequately complete.\u201d\u201cIn the time since I\u2019ve met Jun, I\u2019ve come to know her fairly well. I would even go so far as to call her a close friend. She has spoken of you, Ms. Camilla, on multiple occasions, with nothing but positive things to say, she admires you a great deal. She has told me to some extent of Verri, and the other elements of her past. However\u2026\u201d Brandishing a single finger, Naoki makes her distinction very clear, \u201cShe has not, in the past few months when we have learned of Jill\u2019s involvement in Goraia and her ascension to the top of the metaphorical ladder, mentioned that she was once closely acquainted with the woman.\u201dFalling silent again, Naoki relapses into thought, rubbing at her chin. There must be some manner of reasoning behind it, but she cannot for the life of her figure out what it might be. Admittedly, Naoki isn\u2019t quite sure if Jun is even aware that Jill is currently the \u2018Empress\u2019, but\u2026 she has no excuse not to be, really. And if she is, Naoki can see no reason why Jun wouldn\u2019t mention to someone that she has a history with the figure. That seems like a good detail to share. From there, Naoki proceeds into other lines of thought, more fully analysing the information she was just given and considering how it all fits in with what she was already aware of, and what conclusions can be drawn from it.It would stand to reason that Camilla\u2019s mind was fooled with by Zephidel or the other members of the coup, removing her memories and such, of pregnancy. However, it doesn\u2019t make sense- why they would use her to open one of the elemental gemstone boxes, tamper with her memory, and then leave her somewhere to die? It would have been preferable on their part, Naoki thinks, to either keep her around- imprisoned, in the event that they are ever able to locate any more of the gemstones, or to simply kill her, and prevent her from becoming the thorn in their side Naoki intends to make her, ending the lineage there and then. Leaving a loose end like that is suspicious, and Naoki, always one to err on the side of caution, wonders if any lasting effects of their tampering remain with her. With her own research into the magics of the mind, Naoki thinks that some sort of relay, or remote observation spell would not at all be out of the question. Heck, they could have simply planted a mundane scrying focus in her head and sealed it up. Though Naoki supposes it\u2019s a bit late in the conversation to, Naoki resolves to inquire further about the matter and perhaps ask to have Camilla thoroughly examined before showing her any particularly sensitive information or warplans. However, this line of thinking leads to another question, which Naoki articulates as such, \u201cI do hate to keep you on this topic, but I must ask- do you have any insight on this \u2018Zephidel\u2019? He is almost a complete unknown to us, and even if he is well and truly out of the picture at this point, I remain curious as to his involvement.\u201d", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Sitting quietly, hands folded in her lap, Naoki\u2019s attention remains focused on Camilla as she relates her tale.

There was nothing but honesty from the Princess, and one could tell because she had every reason not to lie, for one thing, and for another, it was not part of her nature to lie. That was crystal clear.\"But I digress, Jun brought the girl to me soon after I married Prince Evrand... And I took a liking to her-- I had no reason at the time not to like her because she did not seem like she would do what she did. It might be that Jun didn't speak of Jill because she doesn't know much of anything about her. She knows as much as I. I cannot speak for the girl but I can honestly say that she had my best interest at heart. Jun is as honest and forthcoming as I have ever known anyone to be, she would have to have a very good reason to keep something to herself. Jill... I tend to see the best in most people... I believed in her.\" She sighed softly and pondered silently for a long pause.She sipped at her water until it was empty, then set the glass aside and reached to touch Blake's hand to let him know it was safe to touch her again. It felt kind of like a weight was being lifted off of her shoulders to have someone else of influence to want to know what people only speculated about. It was nice to be asked and listened too when many people spoke rumor.She then looked Naoki in the eye, the caramel eyes sad, now, tired. \"I carry the weight of much guilt on my shoulders... For running away when I was betrothed to that prince and hiding for as long as I did, to letting that artifact fall into the wrong hands because I thought it was my destiny to save the world. So many people have died...Verri... then Medan... The reality is, it will happen again if this doesn't end soon... Not by me, but by my descendant... I cannot live with that. It has to end, even if it means it kills me.\" And that was her revelation. She had much to think about, especially now as her hand found her unborn child... Tears spilled, finally. It didn't seem fair.She looked to Blake with the understanding she now had and said softly, \"I may have to be the one to destroy the scepter...\" Which meant that she could very well die along with the babe in her belly.
