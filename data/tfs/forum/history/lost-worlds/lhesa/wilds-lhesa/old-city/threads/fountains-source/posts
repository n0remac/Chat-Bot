The beauty of its craftsmanship is a wonder to behold. And yet, the people of the city do not gather here. Artists do not seek inspiration. Lovers do not cast coins in and wish for a kiss. Those that do pass rarely stop for long.Elsewhere in the city, fountains flow with clear, clean water. Some were restored by workers hired by various merchant houses seeking to beautify their surroundings. Some have never stopped, the water still pouring after long centuries had passed. But this fountain stands quiet and dry.The city is seeking to hire an individual or group to find the blockage and restore flow to the fountain. Hardly the most glamorous expedition into Old Lhesa, but potentially a lucrative one. In addition to a reward in gold, the contract comes with a license to retrieve artifacts and treasures from the old city, which always carry a reward of their own for recovery.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "In the populated portion of the reclaimed City of Lhesa, in what was once a town square or forum, stands an ornate fountain of marble and gold.

Which is to say that lots were drawn among the rookies, and these were the four whose names were pulled from the hat. Marrick, Vince, Gino, and Evaasi, a tall woman from the north the others called \u201cRed\u201d despite her blonde hair, followed behind him as he set out.They were all green, only in the watch for a month or so, and also noticeably younger Thal. They knew it was something of a testing assignment for him, to act as the officer on this, and to their credit, the group seemed determined to do their best and give him a fair shot. They were also quicker to speak up with their own input, suggestions, and opinions than they might otherwise be.\u201cAny idea where the pipe even comes from?\u201d Vince rested his hand on the side of the fountain, leaning down to look into the drain.\u201cThat\u2019s the exit pipe, kid.\u201d Marrick laughed and pointed higher up the stonework. \u201cThe water is supposed to come out from there. The pipe comes up from underneath, runs through the middle here, and fills the top. Then each level overflows, and the water spills out to the one below, until it gets to her. That pipe probably takes it out to sea.\u201d\u201cSo where does it come from, then?\u201d Vince bent the other way to try to look under the fountain.\u201cThe mountain, probably.\u201d Marrick pointed to the rocky peaks in the distance. \u201cRunoff, or springs, or something like that. Just like the canals. The pipe here runs under the street, but it\u2019s got to start from somewhere higher than the fountain. Otherwise, it couldn\u2019t go up and out the top. Unless there\u2019s a pump somewhere.\u201dGino interrupted another question from Merrick to interject. \u201cHow do you know so much about it?\u201d\u201cI was apprenticed to an engineer before I ran away to Lhesa. It was boring, though. No one sings songs about engineers. Who knows? Maybe I\u2019ll go back to it one day.\u201dAnd so the conversation went as they stood around, inspecting the fountain and waiting to see if more specific orders would be forthcoming.", "link_list": ["/user/2489"], "image_list": [], "html": "<span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-2489 group-0\" href=\"/user/2489\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@thalricdale\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Thalric Dale, Paladin</span></a></span>"}, "post-72976": {"user": "Thalric Dale, Paladin", "user_num": 2489, "timestamp": "1505342461000", "message": "\"This works in our favour today, we'll be singing your name at the tavern tonight, Merrick,\" Thalric replied, observing the details as pointed out by the one-time engineer.

No townsfolk coming in after us, not that I think we'll have any volunteers at this point. Primary objective is the water; this isn't a treasure hunt. Any questions?\" he said, quickly getting to business as he let Merrick find the point where they could enter.
