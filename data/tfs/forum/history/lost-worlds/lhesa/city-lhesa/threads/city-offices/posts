Captain Vargo questioned Thalric Dale, Paladin  about his experience, his past, and his outlook s it might pertain the job at some length. He was thorough and detailed, but always in a way that came off as polite and professional rather than abrasive or harsh.Overall, the captain was a man that took his job seriously, and he took the recommendation of the woman that paid his wages somewhat less seriously than that. He made it clear that he expected the city watch to be shining examples of civic virtue and upstanding members of the community they were protecting. He also expected them to break skulls in the name of peace and justice, if needed, contradictory as that might seem.Lhesa\u2019s light-touch and low-detail laws attracted more than a few that were trying to avoid the tighter restrictions of other places, and some of them were criminals at heart intending to take advantage. The job of seeing that the city was a haven of freedom rather than a hive of wickedness fell to the watch.Most of his coworkers were former adventurers that had decided steady, reliable pay was the better bet than treasure-hunting, or had simply decided this was as good a place as any to settle and make a home, and chose the job closest to what they knew. They knew the city well enough, and had connections with the people from that shared history. But few had any real experience in law-enforcement before signing up. Given all that, it seemed that Thalric and the people he would be working with were going to be training each other.At the end of the interview, Vargo stood up to shake Thalric\u2019s hand. \u201cWelcome to the watch, then. Probationary, in-training, so on and so forth, but I think you\u2019ll be a good fit here.
