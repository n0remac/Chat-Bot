At first, it was simply a place for explorers and adventurers to trade among themselves, but soon enough professionals turned up to sell gear and equipment to them.Now, the market is a thriving trade hub, dealing not just in supplies and treasures associated with reclaiming the lost city or exploring the jungles, but in virtually every sort of goods. Lax regulations on trade and low taxes bring merchant vessels from far off nations to deal in exotic wares that cannot be purchased anywhere else within a thousand miles or more.\u00a0Shortages and the volatile market associated with such a young city create and dash fortunes quickly here. If the rapid growth can be maintained and stabilized, Lhesa is on track to become the go-to location for exotic trades, but for now, the market remains a high-risk investment.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/K9i6IJf.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"Lhesa Market\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/K9i6IJf.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/>"}}
