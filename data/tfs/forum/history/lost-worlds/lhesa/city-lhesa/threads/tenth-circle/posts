Named The Tenth Circle, all of the de la Fierna bloodline are welcomed to come live at the Gothic inspired mansion.

The ring finger of her right hand bore the signet ring of the House de la Fierna, a family heirloom that had to be altered to accommodate her tiny finger. Pleasant music from the pipe organ below swelled throughout the estate. Despite the distance from her suite to the room that held the massive instrument, the music could be heard throughout The Tenth Circle when Ultio Ridet de la Fierna sat down to play. The corners of her lips pulled up in the smallest smile. Her twin's choice of music spoke volumes of his mood. Little touched Retaliation, but joy felt by one of her siblings was the closest to happiness she ever felt herself. Rising from the velvet lined bench, she turned and walked out of her rooms, her long skirts and tail flowing behind her. Retaliation looked over the halls as she went, seeking out any final imperfections that would need to be seen to. They had purchased the largest estate on in the city of Lhesa and then had the insides gutted and redone, a project requiring sweat, blood, and magic. She descended the grand staircase and made her way to seek her brother. Every servant she passed bowed or her curtsied to her, whispers of, \"Your Grace,\" trailing in her wake. When finally she reached the music room, one wall of which was now engulfed in its entirety by the magically crafted organ, she moved quietly across the room until she stood behind her brother. She placed her hands gently on his shoulders, a rare offering of affection from the de la Fierna scion, and leaned her forehead softly against the back of his head. She remained like this until the song was finished, refusing to interrupt. When the music faded away at last, she said, \"Lhesa agrees with you, then?\"", "link_list": ["/user/2476"], "image_list": [], "html": "With deft fingers, Tali fixed the jeweled hoops to the curved silver tips of her horns.

A family with no title, no standing, no well known history that appeared from seemingly nowhere. Yes, of course she could understand how a merchant family could build themselves up in a single human generation, but to have the kind of wealth necessary to finance not just expeditions but to lay claim to what was found... that would be nearly impossible to accomplish in just a few decades. \"To amass such resources... what kind of merchants are they?
