The distinct taste of metal is in the airalong with the methodical chime of chains pulling ore to the surface and workers below thefrozen rock, bringing more to the surface. The shops set up close by because the workers themselvesdo not have much time away from the mines to get what they need.The Markets here are not as colorful or varied as those that you will find in other cities, but thewares sold are sold out of necessity. Anything frivolous and colorful will most likely find itselfdirtied with coal or grime within the hour, and will usually be looked down on by the citizens themselves.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://www.fontsquirrel.com/widgets/test_drive/f967dd1951676aaa8949a93c8f5d7dba?s=36&t=The%20Mining%20Market", "https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/b6/34/92/b6349240aa6cc4ab79bc3a82f49b1436.jpg"], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.fontsquirrel.com/widgets/test_drive/f967dd1951676aaa8949a93c8f5d7dba?s=36&amp;t=The%20Mining%20Market\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/><br/></div>"}}
