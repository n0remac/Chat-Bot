It would not be easy to sneak past any of them, and yet...... there was indeed a small crack in the foundation. It seemed to be covered in other fallen rock and snow, however.

The lone warrior would be pleased to find the hole was just about large enough for him to squeeze through after clearing out some of the debris, and he would remove his iron sword from where it was strapped to his hip and carefully send it through the hole first to avoid it banging against the sides of the stony crack through the wall as he squeezed through it. He would also send his bow and quiver of arrows through ahead of him in this manner as well, before squeezing through himself. Once on the other side he would gather his things.He would listen carefully for any approaching patrols atop the wall before moving away from it on the other side.
