Her starlight hair continued to sway and sparkle and gleam off the light of the sun, but the ring on her finger truly caught the sunshine and glowed. It made her feel... wicked.

At the very least curious.She wanted to see what the little creature was capable of, because that was the sort of fae she was. A tricky, mischievous, completely self-ish and self-absorbed fae-- but a queen and a powerful sorceress none the less.So with her fingertip, the snow of the white-draped forest near Strike Fist began to swirl in its own little tornado, whirling, whirling, whirling, until with a ferocious roar that ripped through the skies, one of Neia's favorite pets came bursting from the snowstorm and launched itself at Strike Fist, as large as an elephant, as ferocious as a tiger attacking its prey.Neia laughed, a beautiful, chiming sound as she watched it barrel towards Strike Fist.

The chill and winds of the blizzard did bite at first, but it numbed the feeling of your skin. You shivered, but felt no pain, only stiffness. Only a cold that seeped into your bones until you could no longer feel it. And then, instead, you felt only sleepy.Rest your eyes. Go to sleep. The snow was cold, but it was so soft, and the shelter of the rocks kept the winds at bay. Go to sleep, darling.Go to sleep, darling.And then but distantly, faintly, like a bird calling far, far in the distance, a gentle and muted scream could be heard. Far away from here, an hour's distance from here or perhaps even more, the creature that Neia had summoned to deal with the first trespasser had found the scouting party that had come for Rose again.Yet their screams and the creature's roars seemed but a faint whisper, almost a lullaby, as they faded in and out intermittenly, sometimes carried by the wintry winds, sometimes smothered by them so no one could hear their turmoil and struggle.Rose's eyelids were heavy, drooping. It would be so easy to give in, wouldn't it? The cold embraced him, loved him, sheltered him like nothing else had or could do with his future raped before his very eyes. Destroyed. Shattered.Go to sleep, darling.But when his eyelids did sleepy lift, reminded to stay awake by his warriors intuition, by the red glow of the pendant that hung around his neck, he saw not winter before him, but a woman instead. A beautiful woman with hair like starlight and eyes as pale blue as the glaciers of the mountain. Her lips were pale pink, and her body was clothed in ice that sparkled like diamonds. She smiled at him, beautiful and loving and serene, and when she stepped towards him the snow parted as if water. The long sparkling veil she wore over the back part of her hair swayed, but not by the wind that blue but by a deeper magic instead.\"You have wandered very far from home,\" the tall and magnificent woman told the young boy freezing to death in the nooks and cranny of rocks. It would be too hard to spreak. The freeze and the cold alone would have locked the muscles of his jaw, making it too difficult to move. \"Sh, sh, sh, my darling,\" the beautiful woman said. She was perfection. Perhaps an angel? She was almost too lovely to look at, her gaze too enchanting, her voice too spell-binding. \"I will take care of you.\" And her snow-soft hands reached for him.Darkness consumed him, blessed darkness... and with it, warmth.When Rose finally woke again, he was covered in warm furs on a bed, in a grandiose room that was made of beautiful sculpted ice and snow in hues of blue and white and purple and even green, shimmering like crystal.s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/c4/95/ed/c495ed30c15b13362335ae262f7ab3b9.jpg", "link_list": ["https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/c4/95/ed/c495ed30c15b13362335ae262f7ab3b9.jpg"], "image_list": [], "html": "It was harder to burn to death.

Please be cautious if torture is not something you can handle.))Four days would pass as Rose lied defenseless in the bed. His body remained stiff as a board and his breathes almost unnoticeable. The boys skin kept a pale color that implied illness. The frost bit Rose in many places, leaving fiery red spots on every part of his body that the bitter weather could touch. The warm and lush covers that hid most of his body also hid much of the damage. If one peeked into the room they would think it was just someone sleeping.Resting on a large and fluffy pillow the head of Rose. Thin white hair surrounded the boys head, revealing the damage his head received. Around his left eye and around his right ear had a smokey grey color as if it had been burnt by fire. His lips had turned a purple tint that faded at their edges into Rose's pale face. The poor boy still had an elegant and solemn look even on his death bed.\u00a0In his dreams for the entire period of time, Rose was reliving his life. Days were seconds in the real world. The pendant Rose wore continued to pulse subtly so that the light would not disturb his slumber. \u00a0For the first day and a half Rose rested, the pendant was what kept him alive. Once Rose's body could sustain itself, the pendant was working on other magic.\u00a0The dreams would all fade and the void would set in on Rose. The nightmare would begin again, replaying the scene over and over in his mind. To show the separation of mind and body, Rose's body made no movement, just a slight twitch in his charred left eyelids. This scene played thousands of times before they ended by a nightmare in another form.Chained upside down to the Unworthy Cross was Rose. The cross itself was made of Onyx and the chains crafted from blood. Serpents crafted from holy energy slithered all over the body of Rose before wrapping itself around the top of the Unholy Cross. This same serpent would look upwards and begin to show it's fangs. In a flash the serpent struck the air with fangs dripping with blood. As the Serpent lashed out it exploded into a cannon of blood on the ground in front of Rose's upside down body. No matter what Rose had been through, things were still scaring the timid young man.\u00a0The pool of blood would begin to rise and form two legs. As the blood rose higher, more of the figures body could be seen. The blood eventually revealed a blood version of Rose. Darkness had set in on Rose's mind and now the Darkness would claim Rose.\"The Holy Serpent of lies and blasphemy have killed your family... The Holy created the Incubus and Succubus to please the Angels of the Light. When they polluted the Heavens, the Holy cast them into the Darkness to blame us for what would happen in this world by their touch. Your leader welcomed these despicable Holy creations into your home... Much of the world will fall to the Holy powers who kill any who reject their word as your tribe fell to these Holy abominations...\" a deep voice bellowed from the blood Rose.\"Why would they do something like this? Why would the Holy create an abomination they knew would taint their Heavens? Why would they curse mankind with these creations?\" Rose spoke while tearing up.\"The Holy created your world for it's pleasure. Those who oppose their rule and can survive are pushed into Darkness. The way of the Holy is trickery and you have fallen for it. Your father was different... He accepted the Darkness and knew himself that the Holy created Sin and that mankind should not be punished for the actions of the Heavens. He rose up to the cause and showed your tribe that they did not need the Holy to provide. Accept the Darkness as your father did and I promise you will be able to rid the world of the Holy.\" The deep voice rang again before dropping back to the ground.Rose hung on the cross rethinking everything he knew. The blood Rose was right, that the Holy created to create everything; they should be responsible for the Sin and tragedy in this world. When Rose finally convinced himself, the blood on the ground moved again. The blood would creep up the cross to engulf Rose and the Cross, coating everything as it was. This was a sign Rose accepted the Darkness.The blood would pull off of Rose's body and turn into a small blade the size of a razor blade. This blade formed in front of Rose's face and rose to his chest. When the blade reached the chest it dug into Rose until it reached bone. Rose could do nothing but scream as the blood blade cut deep into him and began to carve him. Following each bone in the body the blade made it's way from bottom to top. When the blades reached his eyes, they stopped just long enough for the blood Rose to appear once again but with the blade in his right hand.\"One must be able to see the truth in a blind world.\", the blood Rose whispered in Rose's left ear.\u00a0With a quick jab of the blade, the blood Rose began the first part of conversion to it's darkness. The blade would carve into the eyelids while follow the socket structure in his cranium. When the flesh was completely detached, the blood Rose would inject blood into the cut that would lift flesh out that had been carved. With it's hand, the blood Rose removed the eyeballs from the skull, sending fluids everywhere as the eyeballs were crushed in his hands; some fluids even trailing back into the holes in Rose's face. Blood poured and screams continued, but Rose did not die.\"One must be able to speak in tongues to understand the lies of Holy across the world.\" The blood rose whispered into the same ear on Rose as before.The blood Rose used to the blood like hooks to pull Rose's mouth open while holding the skin back farther. The blood blade in the blood figures right hand was slowly pressed into Rose's gums at the farthest point back. The blade would find itself gliding through the gums across the teeth roots like piano keys. The blood rose would have to cut the gums from the outside and inside of the mouth, making sure to take it's time. When the gums were fully cut, the blood Rose would take hold of them with his index finger and his thumb, ripping teeth and all out of his head. With a quick toss the gums and teeth were gone and the blood Rose had a hold on Rose's tongue. With a power pull, the blood Rose ripped the tongue out of the mouth.\"One must be able to hear their lies to know the truth.\" The blood rose whispered again.Cutting deep into the flesh behind the ears, the blood blade would begin it's duty again. Blood spewed this time as the blade entered the flesh. In two minutes the blade had cut Rose's ears off and into his eardrums. Bloods poured from the ears also, adding more mess to the scene.A seal formed around the cross that caused the blood to pulse a neon red. Dark magic began to fill the hellscape in Rose's mind. The blood would begin to spiral like a vortex on the ground and pulled out of the blood into it. Rose's blood began to run from his body and into the spiraling void of blood. In the last seconds of the actions in his mind, the cross was consumed into the blood void with Rose.Once everything was gone and Rose was floating in the blood void, the voice echoed one last time, \"Your new life is waiting. Open your eyes.\"Rose laid motionless on the bed still, but his eyes shot open, including the burnt one. His silver eyes rested on the bed he was in and the room around. The boy couldn't feel his body for \u00a0moment before the pain set in and tears began to fill his eyes. The thought of being in this room soon left his mind as his attention focused on the intense pain in his near dead body. In this pain a hunger was forming, but not even Rose would know how to fulfill it.

The boy didn't eat fast at all, each bite having a slight distaste in his mouth that left an aftertaste similar to blood. Although the new hunger with Rose was growing, he had received enough sustenance to slightly tame it. Now staring down at his Frosted Plum, Rose contemplated on eating it. Rose took his right hand and picked up the frosted plum from his tray to take a better look at it. The Merosiky family was nobility in their tribe, but foreign foods, especially desserts, peaked their curiosity. Rose would sniff the plum and tap it with his tongue to get a quick taste. The sugar was delightful and covered the aftertaste much better than the salty foods. The poor frosted plum stood no chance as Rose ate it with haste. It did little for his hunger, but his mouth tasted more normal to him.When he was done in with the frosted plum, Rose spoke again in his soft and lifeless voice, \"Many legends have been spoken of the The White Mountain. Only hunters and soldiers knew the truth. I was the second smartest student in my tribe, my father was a doctor, and I studied warfare and combat under the leader.

These were the first moments he had to look back on the events without fear or pain surging through his body. The thoughts angered him now instead of making him fearful. Rose's jaw began to clench as a sharper set of teeth emerged within his closed mouth to keep them hidden. His eyes shifted and remained slitted as the anger and thoughts surged through him. When the memory was over, Rose's mind drifted back to Neia being present, his mannerism kicking in as he calmed himself.Rose looked up to Neia through his silver strands of hair that hid the tear trails on his face, \"This may sound rude since I am the guest in your humble abode, but may we not speak of why I am here and accept it as Fate? Things have been very tragic for me. If you could please tell me about who you are and why you are here to distract my mind for awhile, I will tell you when I can handle myself better since I feel very ill at the moment.\" \u00a0With his meal now finished and his focus on Neia, Rose set his dinner tray to the side of the bed beside Neia. With a slight gesture using his left hand, Rose pushed his hair flourescent white hair behind his ears to fully show his eyes and attention.

Her hand sliding out of his own hand felt like water flowing over his palm. Neia would find in time that her frosted plums would not hold him prisoner like a mortal being, but that they kept his mortal side present while they tamed the beast within. As time would reveal, the traits these plums had on mortals were traits Rose already possessed even if he did not know this himself.When the hand placed itself on his chest, Neia would feel no flex in his chest. His heart did not seem to beat or his lungs expand. The warmth that normally radiated from a mortals flesh was false. The warmth she felt was the coldness his body carried that remained at a warmer temperature than Neia's touch. In the hands of a mortal his flesh would feel as if it was steel that had been left in ice for days. As his body produced a false warmth, her touch produced the soothing feel of menthol on Rose, casting the only thing he could feel.\u00a0He felt her finger tips on his bare chest, tantalizing his young muscles. He touch called to him, his mind taking in her beauty, mercy, and touch at once, Rose's mind forming an admiration for the woman. Many traits about him had changed while others had not changed, but rather increased and intensified. His silver eyes rested on Neia's while she worked her feminine magic granted to her by the gods. Her soothing voice speaking to him while mixed with her touch and the frosted plums, made Rose feel like a king who wanted to please his queen no matter if it was blood or pleasure that she wanted from him.\u00a0\"My father told me the same thing when he was around. Even with different words, that was one of the last things I was able to hear from him.\" Rose spoke to Neia in his lifeless voice while focusing on her eyes that he marveled like diamonds he wished to possess.In such a calm moment, Neia made a mistake. As the mortal angel placed her touch on his pendant, a reaction occurred. Rose's right hand shot over her hand on the pendant; his strength showing no mercy as it clenched around her hand forcing her to hold the pendant in fist. His silver eyes remained locked on Neia's, but they would instantly changed to the slitted eyes of a predator as the new situation unfolded. Neia's brief touch was likely to leave a scar forever on her mind; whether it be for good or bad.Blood spewed from the pendant like a web immediately following her contact with the pendant. This blood would wrap around the hand of Rose and Neia, magically locking them in place. Even with such restraints put on Neia's hand, she could feel Rose's hand lighten up to a softer hold. Neia would feel something run around her hand as Rose's blood pulled from beneath his skin and mixed with the frost her touch naturally created.\u00a0Once her hand was held in place, the purpose of the pendant would become relevant to Neia. Everything that had occurred to Rose before his arrival, good or bad, would begin to flow into her mind. The scenes from life before the horror would show a pleasant and humble life for Rose as he studied and trained. Seconds later, after a lifetime of memories flashed before Neia in her mind, the horror would take place. These horrors did not move like the good memories or even act like they did. The horror took place in real time, but instead of Rose being in the scene, Neia was in Rose's position to see and feel everything that he had to deal with on that fateful evening. The magic from the pendant wanted Neia to be aware of everything about Rose.When the horror was over, all went black. Brief scenes of blood and destruction filled her mind, Rose being the center of each scene. As each futuristic scene became clearer, she would notice Rose was wearing her mark on his garments. Further on with these scenes, she would see Rose in garments fit for a king and a ring around his finger. The final scene was Rose standing on a balcony overlooking the Norkari Mountains covered in the brutal effects of an eternal winter. \u00a0When all was over, her mind went black one more time; a voice would rise this time instead of an image, \"Cherish him. Your will is his command and his heart can be yours to control. The Darkness has chosen him to carry it's will, make sure you do not defy it's will. While the mortal live and die, the Darkness has given him life within death. Cover your mountains in the will of Winter and stain their cities in the blood and snow. With or without you, Rose will carry the will of the Darkness. It is your decision to stand beside him or stand against him, for all his enemies will know death. You are stained with the Merosiky blood, no matter how far you try to separate yourself from him, he will find you, even if in your dreams.\" Neia's desire to touch his pendant had side effects that protected it; as Rose grew stronger, so would the pendant's power.When the Darkness finished it's short speech, energy pulsed from the pendant. The energy would blow Neia and Rose's hand off of it while spattering the blood across anything within it's range such as Neia, the bed, and Rose. His eyes returned to normal, still never letting go of their hold on Neia's eyes of ice. Rose felt a chill stretch down his spine as his body returned to normal, but Rose had no idea what happened as the Darkness had taken control of the situation. The only thing Rose noticed was the odd feeling in his mouth as his teeth returned to normal despite never revealing their fanged form beneath the confines of his lips.\u00a0Rose wondered when he seen the blood stains on himself and the surroundings, \"Where did this blood come from? Neither of us are bleeding?\"Rose glanced above him to see if maybe something above him was bleeding. When he seen nothing but the cloths that covered his bedding from above. His eyes moved down to his chest where he noticed a larger amount of blood around his pendant. When he noticed this, he looked to Neia where he would take noticed of her hand that was covered in blood like his chest was. \u00a0The final thing he noticed was the blood on his hand that he used to hold hers. Rose was dumbfounded on what happened and hoped that the angel he found could explain the blood that stained the two.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The blood from beneath his skin that slowly rose to the surface where her frost touched would slowly subside. Her hand sliding out of his own hand felt like water flowing over his palm. Neia would find in time that her frosted plums would not hold him prisoner like a mortal being, but that they kept his mortal side present while they tamed the beast within. As time would reveal, the traits these plums had on mortals were traits Rose already possessed even if he did not know this himself."}, "post-39644": {"user": null, "user_num": null, "timestamp": "1464582892000", "message": "Oh, she did not\u00a0like that.She did not like that at all.When the experience done, when the blood splattered across her dress, across the sparkling white of her skin, when Rose came back into himself, she turned and forced herself away from the bed, the icy heels of her shoes tapping against the cold floor as she walked away. The temperature of the room dropped, dropped...as cold as a grave, and the air was still, where the sparkles of snow and ice floated, suspended in the air on the will of their mistress. Rose was not the only one that possessed an item of great and terrible power, and the ring upon Neia's finger glowed, all but pulsed... and Rose would see on his pendant that it's black filigree turned... turned almost silver, almost as if it were now made of ice.He now wore a pendant that was of the blood of Darkness, and the touch of Winter.But truly, truly what Neia wanted to do?She wanted to rip him to pieces.Who did he think he was? He was but a boy, and she was an ancient being of catastrophic power. And he thought he would rule her\u00a0kingdom? No. It wouldn't be done. She would not have\u00a0it. What was Neia's, was Neia's. And what was not hers, would become\u00a0hers.Neia was indeed trembling with her anger, but her back was turned to the boy and his stupid\u00a0question. Her palms were pressed together, and she finally let out a breath, although like Rose, she did not have to. Instead, it came out like a wind of frost. She turned then to look at him, her starlight hair flowing down her naked back, her dark blue velvet gown wrapped snugly around a body that made men cry.But her eyes... those swirling eyes of her were steady on his face.\"You play a dangerous game, child,\" she told him, and lowered her hands, turning to walk towards him. \"What you wear upon your neck... either you will master it, or it will master you. In the end, however, one of you will be the slave. Will it be you?\"A snowy owl came gliding through one of the windows, and it twirled and then landed, taking the form of a humanoid creature with talons for hands and feet. It seemed to be made of snow, and its eyes glowed like a light shining through a glacier. It held out its hand and Neia walked over to it.It dropped what appeared to be a rag in her hand, and Neia smiled. She tuned to look at Rose and walked towards him, her mood restored as she reached out to stroke the back of her knuckles down his cheek. \"Rest. You will join me once your health has been regained.\"She waved a hand over the bowl by his table and more sugared plums appeared. Then, she turned and walked out of his room, the doors opening for her without any help from her and shutting as well. The snow-fae creature turned to look at Rose, and then it morphed back into the owl, gliding forward to rest upon the foot of his bed and stare at him, blinking its large glacial eyes once.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Oh, she did "}, "post-39705": {"user": "Fenrir Skargard", "user_num": 1568, "timestamp": "1464635814000", "message": "The hunched over figure of a White Wolf powered its way through the blizzard at the peak of the mountain.

When Rose became aware of her temper he knew he needed to avoid it being towards him and direct it towards her enemies.\u00a0The only time he looked away from her was when she cast her magic on his pendant. Half of the pendant became a reminder of her magic and how strong she really was. The frosty part of the pendant didn't serve an aggressive magic, but a defensive magic that completely nullified the harsh realities of the cold. Despite the disgruntled appearance of Neia, Rose was aware that this magical edition to his pendant was a gift. Since the origination of this pendant was crafted from the blood of his family, the frosty edition meant much more to him that was Neia would have expected.\u00a0\"I will control these powers, you will see. I accepted the Darkness as my weapon, not my master. If the blood is not yours, then it is a reminder of my father and what I have become. You are my queen and you will see that I will make you proud.\" Rose spoke as she left the room.A minute passed and Rose looked to the owl at the foot of his bed, \"You're more than welcome to come with me if you want, but I don't expect you to know what i'm saying and to stay right there.\"Rose couldn't rest, he wasn't tired. With a quick tug of the sheets he ripped them off of his form to see he was still in tattered clothing. Rose looked around the room for a minute before he spotted a wardrobe. Live everything else, Rose expected some kind of magic from this wardrobe while he hoped there were clothes within it.\u00a0Rolling off of the bed and to his feet, Rose staggered to the wardrobe. Rose had not been on his feet in many days so walking again was a little odd for him. After falling twice, Rose made it to the wardrobe. When his hand pressed to the hand, a white glimmer of frost raced through the designs on the doors and the doors parted an inch. Rose finished opening the doors to find a black suit made of leathers and armor padding.\u00a0The young male immediately began shucking his old cloths off. Even in ruins, the layers of clothe he had on had to be taken off step by step. After two minutes, Rose stood bare in his room. Looking to the right of the wardrobe, Rose noticed a mirror. Since the boy had felt different, he thought he would look at himself in the mirror. When he did so, he had no reflection. With no reflection he was forced to look at his body himself and feel it. The muscle density and carving was impeccable, \u00a0nothing like what it was a week ago. His tribe had no stories on such creatures like himself, so Rose had no clue that he had become a species of Vampire.After reflecting on himself and trying to figure out the mysteries of his new body, Rose slipped into his armor plated leather suit. The armor carried no weight on Rose like it would have a normal mortal. This leather armor carried a magical effect that fit the leather suit to his body, outlining his muscular tone and young physique like it was spandex. Rose looked again in the wardrobe and the final pieces of his outfit lied at the bottom of the wardrobe. A pair of black knee high boots that latched with straps that would give Rose all the leg and ankle support he needed in the mountains and full control in combat. Beside the boots was a pair of black gloves with nothing special to them except that they matched his outfit and fit like spandex.\u00a0Once Rose was fully dressed again, he brushed his hair with his fingers while walking over to the bed. When he reached the bed he removed a pillow from it's case and poured the frosted plums into the sack. Rose tied this sack to his waist and made way for the door. When he opened the door he would search for Neia.When Rose reached the location of Neia, the first thing she could hear were the boots lightly clapping on the floors. When Neia finally takes notice of Rose, she notices that he does not look like a boy on his feet and in his new garments. Rose looks like a warrior, one of sophistication and a predator.\u00a0The young mans fluorescent white hair fell straight down the sides of his head till it touched his shoulders while two thick bangs crossed over his face. These bangs fell directly over the center of Rose's silver eyes that carried a more lively glare in them. His skin had changed from a sickly pale to a pale more like not getting enough sunlight. His lips were a peach color instead of the sickly purple they once were, but not like the rosy pink lips he had before. The young mans appearance was much different and Neia would probably look twice at Rose and his body groping armor plated leather armor.\u00a0Rose would bow to Neia by lowering his head to her. At first, Rose closed his eyes, but when he opened them, he found something else in his line of sight that perked a juvenile interest as he was still a virgin.\u00a0When Rose caught himself staring at her bosom from the shadows of his lowered head, he knew he was still alive. The depression and morbidness that filled his mind had washed away. He still had his thoughts and memories, but it was like he shut them off with a switch when he put on his new garments and decided he was going to do something. Rose never claimed to be perfect and even with his changes, he was still a young male with more issues than his Darkness within. Never the less, the marveling of the two gloriful frosty moons known as Neia's breast hidden behind her garments assured him he was still partially human and still alive.\u00a0Rose stared for a moment before the thought of bowing too long might make he suspicious or what she would do if she caught him staring. He blinked his eyes a few times and looked up at Neia. He would give her ample time to say something, but when the time came, he would speak.\"I will understand if you say no, but I would like to leave for a day. I feel stronger and more alive than I have ever felt before and I have something I need to do before it is too late. I invited your owl, but I don't know if an owl would want to go where I am going.\" Rose spoke in a soft and polite tone that carried a subtle bass tone in it; just enough to give him a proper male voice of a 15 year old.When he was done speaking, Rose noticed the other beings in the room. He didn't know them, nor was he interested in them at this moment. His attention would stay focused on Neia, giving the other the 'cold-shoulder' towards the existence.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Rose could definitely see Neia was upset about something and it was probably him.

To cross a line or give intended rudeness to the guest of the Fae, or the hospitable Fae yourself, most times meant certain death.

The same way that Fenrir smelled her terrifying power, she could sense the warmness of him and those that were upon the very mountain itself.The Frost Queen pushed up from her throne, and her starlight hair sparkled, the icy diamonds on her low-cut bodice shining, the whisper of her elegant snow-white gown sliding down her legs as she stepped, stepped, stepped down the stairs, closer and closer to where Fenrir was bowed.\u201cDo you know what it means to pledge yourself to the Fae?\u201d she asked of Fenrir, standing before him for a moment before she slowly circled. \u201cIt is not a pact to take lightly, and not one that can be broken as you would any other creature. In fact, breaking it may cause your death,\u201d she said with a chiming laugh as if it were a game she played. And to her, it was.\u201cOf course, it means quite a promise on my end as well. Who is this terror that sends such an astounding, mmm\u2026 virile creature, such as yourself to come upon his knees at my feet?\u201d She asked, and her voice was like the frosted plums she so favored; sweet, but with a soft chill to her words. She reached out and touched the \u2018chin\u2019 of Fenrir\u2019s maw, to tip his face up so that he looked into the swirling, enchanting blue depths of her eyes.And then, of course. She was interrupted.The young man that she had rescued from the cold upon her mountain, Rose Merosiky. He appeared, clothed in tight black leather, and his gaze focused on her\u2026 gloriful frosty moons. The vain fae was pleased for a moment, and then annoyed the next and snapped her fingers loudly, the sound thundering out in the large and spacious throne room\u2014so loud for a moment that it made the chandeliers above them chime ominously.\u201cSpeak, child,\u201d she commanded of him, and then heard his request.

She lowered her hand, and smiled at Fenrir. If either Rose OR Krypt tried to interrupt her again, there would be sore consequences.
