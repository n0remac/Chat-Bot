What could they do, truly? The frost crept over everything, every stone, every wheel. It froze the water of the river, thickening and thickening until it trapped boats in the harbor and caused panic to rise. The temperatures dropped. Children cried. Elders shook. The quick cold naturally caught immune systems by surprise, and people scrambled for their homes; for warm hearths and blankets and clothing to keep themselves warm.Ice followed the frost, hardening, making it hard for fires to stay alight. A party went towards the woods to go to the Witch Upon the Mountain that surely must have done this, but great fae beasts emerged from the forest line, towering mastodons of white fur and tusks and spikes that sprouted from their body -- razorsharp and made of ice.\u00a0The men fell back under their strength, their great trunks swinging men from left to right. They were able to minorly wound the beasts, but they couldn't stop them as they came towards the walls and the towers. The javelins they threw caused the beasts to scream in agony, iron making them steam, but it wasn't enough.And as they crashed into the walls, the ice army came upon the city like a scourge. This army made of ice and snow were not effective as warriors, but the Frost Queen didn't need effective warriors. She needed numbers, and the numbers overwhelmed.With the first wave of this ice warriors, a second wave then did come, of winter fae creatures that were far more skilled than the others. Terror reigned in Aramoor as snow and ice and frost covered every building and every person that stayed too still, that tried to hide in closets or cupboards.Some remained living. Many, in fact, although they were mostly women and children and the elderly and they were herded into the main square while the last of the warrior-like men of Aramoor were hunted down in the city streets to be slain if they did not concede. A great gale swept over the city, making all turn their eyes and faces away who were of warm mortal blood, and there...... in the center of the square...Stood the beautiful, enchanting Frost Queen herself. Her starlight hair swayed down her back, a beautiful, sparkling crown within the tresses. Her gown was white and silver, made of ice and frost and snow and it was as enchanting as the rest of her. Indeed, it was hard to look away, and her red, red lips smiled at them.\"Do not be afraid,\" she said to them as she stepped forward, her long, long train trailing behind her and chiming quietly, like icicles caught on a wintry breeze. \"I am here to protect you,\" the Frost Queen told the mortals that shivered beneath her swirling blue gaze. \"I am here to nurture you, and mother you, and be your deserved and beloved Queen.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The first thing the City Watch saw from their walls and towers was the frost creeping over the forest and across the meadow that separated Aramoor from the dark forests that covered the Norkari Mountains.

He appeared to be in his late twenties, with brown hair cut short and icy blue eyes. There was a cut over his left eyebrow from previous fighting that bled slowly, obscuring his vision. Besides that wound were only bruised where his armor absorbed previous blows, as well as exhaustion. Still however he held his bloodied sword before him, ready to slay more of the damned creatures as they came.The only thing that held his resolve was the chance of perhaps fighting off the creatures to save his family.
