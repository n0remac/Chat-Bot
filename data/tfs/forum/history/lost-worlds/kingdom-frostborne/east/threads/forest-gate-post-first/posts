There is not much mythos surrounding the Dark Forest. It remains a mystery and an enigma as ever before. It has existed for as long as creatures have been there. None venture in, other than to travel upon the Ranger's Road, a road protected by the Peregrine Rangers.Indeed, the Forest Gate itself, made from the Dark Forest, is patrolled by the Peregrine Rangers, and where the patrol eats and sleeps. They are leery of people who would come through this road, for even the lone Ranger's Road is not safe from whatever lurks within the Dark Forest.... Not to mention, the Dark Forest itself has become a place far more wild with magic now that the Frost Queen has taken residence within the kingdom of Frostborne.Beware, Traveler. Stay to the road, and keep your lantern lit.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://www.fontsquirrel.com/widgets/test_drive/f967dd1951676aaa8949a93c8f5d7dba?s=36&t=the%20Forest%20Gate", "https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/cd/9b/14/cd9b14b152d005595490b3ecaf2e44f0.jpg"], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.fontsquirrel.com/widgets/test_drive/f967dd1951676aaa8949a93c8f5d7dba?s=36&amp;t=the%20Forest%20Gate\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/><br/></div>"}}
