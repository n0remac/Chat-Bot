Everything under the queen's domain has been turned into winter, and those who can sense or feel magic can feel the pulse of the fae magic althrough out the kingdom. Heck, even if you can't usually feel magic, you'll feel it's soft and gentle tingle along your skin and shadowing at your dreams as you sleep under the Frost Queen's skies.Everything here is susceptible to the magical influence of the Frost Queen, which turns minds in favor of the Frost Queen -- not meaning mind control, but the longer you stay in Frostborne, the more content you are to be under the Frost Queen's rule. You do not lose all manner of decision making, you do not become a brainless yuppy, you simply become more Pro-Frost Queen the longer you remain in Frostborne. Those who live here find themselves becoming immortal, becoming immune to the cold. The people even begin to look a little more elfin, a little more beautiful. In short, the longer you stay under the Frost Queen's winter, the more fae-like you become.Another note?The skies are always alive with the Frost Queen's eternal winter magic, much like the Aurora Borealis, although not always visible as snow storms and blizzards are known to make their occasional way across the land of Frostborne.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://www.fontsquirrel.com/widgets/test_drive/f967dd1951676aaa8949a93c8f5d7dba?s=60&t=Frostborne", "https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/50/11/52/5011521061dba62f47a2298dead02571.jpg"], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.fontsquirrel.com/widgets/test_drive/f967dd1951676aaa8949a93c8f5d7dba?s=60&amp;t=Frostborne\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/><br/></div>"}}
