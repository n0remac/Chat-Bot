A sprawling dome with countless support columns attached, the Central Magic Dispenser provides for all of the Steelscapes magic supply needs, powering the various runes, scrying equipment, rituals, portals, and other constant needs in The Steelscape. Under the constant expansion, numerous magic producing stones are placed in the Central Magic Dispenser and from there become hooked up to the cities network.It is under constant supervision from mages to ensure everything runs smoothly and also features a contingent of guards to ensure no tampering will take place. The location of the Central Magic Dispenser is directly beneath the base of the Sorrowful Spire, only accessible from the inside of the Spire as there are wards permanently in place to prevent teleportation into it.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/OTr56Tg.jpg"], "html": "<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/OTr56Tg.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}}
