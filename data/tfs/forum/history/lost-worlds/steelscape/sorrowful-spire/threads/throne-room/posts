Only when guests of extreme notoriety and status visit is the room unlocked and used. Despite the lack of use, the room itself is quite impressive and is kept in good condition year-round. The floor is made of a reflective metal-like substance and pillars and statues flank the way on the path to the throne itself. Although there is no noticeable light source, the entirety of the room is well lit, presumably by magical light sources.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/3LmvO1B.jpg"], "html": "<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/3LmvO1B.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}}
