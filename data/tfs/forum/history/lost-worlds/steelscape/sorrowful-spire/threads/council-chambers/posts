The room is circular in shape, with vaulted ceilings and columns forming a circular outline around the table that sits in the center of the chamber. The table in the center of the room is rather sizable and made of a white marble, with thirty chairs surrounding it. There is a single entrance into the Council Chambers through two sizable metal doors. The rest of the walls are filled with windows looking out onto the circular hallway that is around the Council Chambers, allowing onlookers to look into when opened to the public.Although usually only the Archlord and his Directors are in attendance, there are times when numerous people of importance from the city are let in and can make suggestions for the Archlord and Directors. This room is also sometimes used for high profile trials that the Archlord oversees personally.
