Bedrooms, baths, a private kitchen staffed at all hours, private portals leading to specific parts of the city, a library, and countless other rooms can be found the Archlord\u2019s Chambers, all decorated in the most opulent manner. The Archlord\u2019s Chambers are also heavily guarded, all entrances constantly under watch from the central scrying tower. Plenty of other security measures are also in place, making it an incredibly safe place to stay. Do to this fact, it is quite common for visitors of importance to be invited to stay in the Chambers as many might be fearful of assassination attempts in other parts of the Steelscape.
