The monstrously sized tower starts at the floor of the Steelscape and reaches all the way up to the ceiling. Widest at the bottom and slightly tapering off as it goes up, the \u201cSorrowful Spire\u201d as it is called reaches the very top of the cavern. There are countless entrances to this structure, as hundreds of sky bridges branch from the walls of the cavern to the tower itself, but all are guarded in a similar fashion. Instead of reaching an actual entrance into the tower, one will find themselves walking through a portal that will lead them to another portal on the same level of the tower. These portals are capable of being turned on and off by the main monitoring stations. Due to the strict security of the tower, the crime rate inside it is extremely low.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/NTiz0Ak.jpg"], "html": "<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/NTiz0Ak.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}, "post-49169": {"user": "Nash, Lord of Bones", "user_num": 580, "timestamp": "1473534317000", "message": "Nash had entered the underground city out of curiousity and learned that this was a place he could make home.
