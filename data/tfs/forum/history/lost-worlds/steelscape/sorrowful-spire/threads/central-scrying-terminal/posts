Using numerous scrying orbs and other devices of a similar nature allow those in this room to keep an eye on a good majority of the Steelscape\u2019s activity. Although the coverage is quite good, it is an unspoken rule of sorts that for normal crimes the Scrying Terminals won\u2019t be used to call in the Security Branch. Only for things that endanger a large amount of the city's populace or Equinox Industries directly are considered threatening enough to call in security via the Scrying Terminal.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/rlR9lZp.png"], "html": "<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/rlR9lZp.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}}
