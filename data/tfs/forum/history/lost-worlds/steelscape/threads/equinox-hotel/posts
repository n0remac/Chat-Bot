Magical lifts, manned by attendants, are used to get to each floor swiftly.The only part of the building, not rooms is the first floor, fifth floor, and tenth floor which each contain dining halls, bathing facilities, and the check in/check out desk. Those staying will be given a key to their room along with a room number. The rooms doors are reinforced and also contain a magical alert to those inside if forced entry is attempted.
