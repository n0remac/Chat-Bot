Although there are several independent companies based down there, the largest and most notable is that of Equinox Industries. Based in a number of towers with connecting bridges, one can order just about any metal they want in any quantity they want from Equinox Industries mining. One can also access various portals to different mining sites from these buildings, assuming proper permission has been granted. In addition to the portals, tunnels lead out from this location, most heading to long depleted mines that are located near The Steelscape. Those interested in purchasing or speaking to someone in charge can simply ask one of the many employees who stand watch at the bottom of various towers.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/OHcDwWQ.jpg"], "html": "<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/OHcDwWQ.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}}
