Built primarily for the processing of large amounts of ore over speciality work, the Equinox Forges sprawl across quite a large area on the Steelscape\u2019s floor. The only part of the Forge is visible from above as approximately half the Forge extends into the wall of the Steelscape, mainly done to save prime property space. Although manned by all manner of creatures, the most common workers to be found in it are dwarves and demons.There is an office out front of the large complex that can be used by those wishing to order a shipment of the various metals or talk about selling mining rights. Those looking for speciality weapons and armor should go to one of the smaller forges located in the city.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/j9oWce1.jpg"], "html": "<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/j9oWce1.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}}
