These doors are located in the northern part of the valley, embedded in the side of a mountain. After a recent change, the doors have been opened to all who wish to visit the Steelscape. Once one passes through the doors, they will find themselves in a large room, filled with portals of various sizes and signs denoting to where the portals lead. This room is usually rather busy as many of the inhabitants of the Steelscape use this portal hub to travel around the city with ease.
