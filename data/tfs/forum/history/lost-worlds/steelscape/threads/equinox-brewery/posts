Although there are numerous other businesses that produce such things, Equinox Brewery is most definitely the largest producer in the Steelscape. The brews are made in a large warehouse which ships its products to various suppliers both in the Steelscape and on the Overworld.In front of the warehouse lies the main branch of Equinox Brewery, a single story building that features several entrances. Beside the door of each entrance is a sign denoting what type of speciality that section of the building produces, whether it be drinks, potions, poisons, etc. Inside customers are free to browse the various brews that are inside labeled glass cabinets. Some of the more expensive brews are stored in the back section of the store and must be requested from the clerks personally.
