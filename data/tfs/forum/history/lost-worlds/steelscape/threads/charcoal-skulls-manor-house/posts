Although there are plenty of other hideouts and storage areas for this gang scattered around the city, the Manor House is one of the few known about by the average Steelscape citizen. Unlike most of the other buildings in The Steelscape, this one takes the form of the\u00a0typical nobles house. Large windows, high-quality stonework, a typical slanted roof, and even a yard of sorts around it, the Manor House sticks out in The Steelscape compared to the other metal buildings packed in tightly together. Despite its appearance, it is still quite sturdy and features a number of defenses. Guards can be found at both the entrance into the yard and at the door to the house itself. The windows and stones are warded to make them more durable and the entire building will repel scrying attempts. There are also almost certainly secret entrances and exits within the building for a quick getaway if needed.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/6Ka1H26.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/6Ka1H26.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/></div>"}}
