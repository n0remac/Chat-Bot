Supplied by merchants who bring down dangerous artifacts or even by dark magicians selling their own wares, Equinox Magic sells many hard to find items. Several mages who know their trade well can be found manning the shop to give out information and advice to potential clients. Most of the artifacts and rarer items are locked inside warded cases or in the vault in the back.One of the primary draws of this shop is the ability to put in a request for an object of a specific nature. Once the request is put in, the suppliers will be notified to be on the lookout for such items. Of course, purchases made in such a way will cost a bit extra.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/taMxtPG.jpg"], "html": "<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/taMxtPG.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}, "post-50049": {"user": "Jun of the Celadine", "user_num": 108, "timestamp": "1474404821000", "message": "Cautiously, Jun passed through the entrance and into the large shop.
