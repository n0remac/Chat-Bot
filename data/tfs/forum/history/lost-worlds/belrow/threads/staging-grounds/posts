Hundreds of undead soldiers marched, perfectly silent, the only sound from them was the beat of the feet on the sand, and the rattle of their armor. They reached the staging grounds at the main entrance to the ruins. There the sense of chaos ended, these hundreds of dead began to create huge blocks, each one containing over a hundred guardians. To the living sightseers it was a harrowing experience. After five minutes the last soldier had reached it's place. Creating ten blocks of a hundred troops. One thousand dead stood, perfectly in unions. Any general would shed a tear at the precise movements that they had enacted, not a sound was said, not a single collision.\u00a0Then out of the ruins came the next wave. Huge scarab like creatures came out of the darkness. Bright green eyes shining in the dark. From the distance they looked like a foul creature of nature, but as they became closer to the light, it could be plainly seen these where not natural. The eyes where that of bright crystals pulsing with inner light, their bodies made of the same materials as the buildings themselves. The worse thing of all about them was not in their looks but in their sound, or the lack of thereof. Instead of moving on the scuttling legs they had, the floated lazily through the air, levitating half a meter off the ground. When they reached the waiting undead, they moved between the ranks above the dead, tending to armor plates, or exposed or rotting flesh, fixing and mending. Their long spindly legs being used as fine instruments.\u00a0The last thing to rise from the ruins created an earthquake in the very sand. Vibrating sounds could be heard across the desert of hundreds of miles. For out of the ruins rose one of the platforms themselves. Centuries of sand tumbled off its walls as it rose from the ground. Getting wider and wider, creating the shape of a black pyramid. Finally it stood over twenty meters tall. From inside, where once the platform stood, a giant crystal rose from its mass, setting itself like a green vivid beacon at the top of the machine.\u00a0Once this crystal was in place, the true horror of the war machine was realized. The air was full of magic, it could be felt even by those without powers themselves. The war machine began to rise above the ruins, into the very sky. Once it was higher then the tallest buildings in the sand, it began to slowly float towards the staging grounds, slowly levitating over the dozens of ruined buildings. Once clear of the entrance way it slowly lowered itself to the ground and assumed its positionat the end of the waiting army, a single massive black monolith, basking the dead in unnatural green light blazing from the huge crystal at its peak.The grand army was ready once more.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/3c/79/a6/3c79a6d0cc2b6f1e74f4a4c6cc738da5.jpg"], "html": "From the ruins of the city, during the fifth day since the word had been spread the Grand Army marched from the tunnels into the light once more.\u00a0"}, "post-36011": {"user": "Attla, the Conniving", "user_num": 1225, "timestamp": "1462263083000", "message": "Attla was awestruck as the army moved with such fluidity.
