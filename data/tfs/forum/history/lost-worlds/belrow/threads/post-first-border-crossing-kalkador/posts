It was only thanks to the orisons of her clerical training that she had managed to stay alive during the trek. The days were blistering hot and the nights were bitter cold. The divine energies of the orisons kept her temperature somewhere between, sometimes still uncomfortable, but not deadly. Creating small amounts simple food and water was also within her power, thanks to Xivri's diving blessings.<br><br/>\u00a0 \u00a0Finally, after several days of travel, a city had risen over the horizon. What on earth was a city doing way out here? They must have a large oasis to provide them water and food. Treva looked forward to being able to bathe again, as she hadn't seen water in days. As she approached she saw the tail end of a long caravan of large carts being pulled by some horned, grey beasts that looked heavier than any bear she had seen. The whole thing was bristling with magic. This city must be quite something for it to have caravans with that much value.<br/><br/>\u00a0 \u00a0She took a drink from her waterskin and then hurried her pace. Hopefully catching up to the caravan before it made it into the city, she planned to inquire what exactly a city was doing way out here and to try to get enough information to determine why Xivri would send her way out here.<div class=\"quote_clear\"></div></br></div></div>"}, "post-35910": {"user": "Ern of the Rambutan", "user_num": 1452, "timestamp": "1462217276000", "message": "A tall, imposing figure approaches the border, munching on what appears to be a boiled rutabaga.
