Her stomach clenched, but she bowed her head with respect to the priestess as she spoke.<br/><br/>\"I thank you for your time, Yaresh Ral'kan,\" Fairuz said, trying her best to mimic the woman's name. The names of those that were within Belrow seemed at least similar to the languages of Sakand. It was perhaps a reason why the desert heat did not seem to bother the ambassador and her retinue.<br/><br/>Fairuz turned and gestured to her party, and walking beside Yaresh, she led them into the Obelisk.<br/><br/>\"I must make my most humble apologies. I had not known that the Kingdom of Belrow was at war. I should have scheduled my visit for a more convenient time.\" It was very much a rookie mistake, and Fairuz already knew that the knowledge would displeased Lady Zaiyandorel and, more importantly, Lord Zephidel, greatly to know that Fairuz had gone ahead with a diplomatic visit when there was no monarch upon the throne. \"Is there any way that I might offer the assistance of myself or of the Kingdom of Goraia?\" she asked.<div class=\"quote_clear\"></div></br></div></div>"}, "post-39902": {"user": null, "user_num": null, "timestamp": "1464794406000", "message": "\"Then my congratulations instead of my apologies,\" Fairuz said in regards to the Belrow(ish?ian?an?) victory with Aeadan to Yaresh with a small smile.

Finally at the end of the hall was a large bronze leafed gate, currently closed it was over two meters high and able to fit three people abreast. Pushing on it Yaresh opened the gate into the meeting place, the\u00a0Kal'bador.\u00a0It was a large room, exiting on the ground floor the visitors saw clearly that it was a room meant for debate. Surrounding a central platform slightly raised from the entrance floor were series's of terraced blocks, made out of the same black stone they were made to be sat on.
