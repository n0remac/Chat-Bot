Anything further than 100 feet is obscured by the soupy mist, and on the worst days its hard to see more than a tenth of that. To make matter worse for any unsuspecting travelers, icebergs and threatening strange creatures plague these waters. Should one have experience of the sea they might know it to be wise to cover the lamps and cruise in silence, lest you draw the attention of a creeping monster eager for it's next meal.Passage through this sea is restricted, and should you wish to pass include in your post a number between 1 and 100 for a possible (10%) chance at a random encounter.

His clothes looked ragged, like he'd been drug by horses through a field full of rocks. His bag was in the boat next to him, looking about as beat up. Rummaging through it, he found most of his gear gone. Oddly, his purse of gems was still buried under the false flap at the bottom. His boots looked like they'd seen several months of hard use, which was odd since he'd just got them from Naoki's people in Isra.\u00a0\u00a0 A nervous thought took him, but he felt the familiar crystal shaft of his sword wedged under his right leg. He rolled off of it and picked it up off the floor of the boat. It seemed intact, though it would be odd to find it in any other condition.\u00a0\u00a0 How did he even get here? The last thing he remembered, he was floating down a river with a lieutenant from Isra, headed towards Port Silverion. And where is here?
