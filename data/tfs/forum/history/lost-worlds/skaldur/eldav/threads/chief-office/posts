Its grey stone exterior is nothing to marvel at, and like most of the city seems to serve a more functional purpose than anything else. The words \u201cChief Office of Eldav\u00e9l\u201d are ornately carved into the arch surrounding the finely detailed doors, depicting the legend of the city and explaining the supernatural heat from the earth as the still boiling blood of an ancient and long defeated monster.Upon passing through the doors stands an desk and waiting area with benches carved into the wall. In busy times the desk would be manned by a receptionist and several beings would sit and wait to meet the city\u2019s Chief, but now in this time of inactivity and stagnancy is all but empty.Should you have any readon to meet with the city\u2019s Chief, you\u2019d be directed upstairs to a more private office, with a stone desk and several shelves lining the walls. The shelves are half filled with scrolls coated in a thick layer of dust and arranged in no particular order, containing long outdated information on the stores and the production of Eldav\u00e9l.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Somewhere near the city stands a building that looms above the nearby buildings and refineries.
