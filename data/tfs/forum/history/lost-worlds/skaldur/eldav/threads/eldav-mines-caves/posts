Several pools of supernaturally fiery lava are present and pulled from to provide the forges with a heat that not even magical fire can provide.Yet despite the seemingly endless series of mining tunnels built to supply the smiths for centuries, the unmapped and unexplored sections of caves journey further still, supposedly containing unknown mysteries and otherworldly places. Many who have ventured too far never return, and those who do often speak of strange and wonderous adventures, of foreign jungles and fiery hellscapes. Whether these things really do exist or they are the visions of a man made mad by the endless darkness have yet to be seen.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/2Fvex1C_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium"], "html": "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2Fvex1C_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&amp;shape=thumb&amp;fidelity=medium\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}}
