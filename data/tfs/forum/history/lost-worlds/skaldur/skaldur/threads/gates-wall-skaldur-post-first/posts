The only thing that stops them from springing into action is the words of the messanger and the commanding viking, who repeatedly reassures that he is not dangerous. Eventually they get back to work, but suspiscious glances are still thrown his way.<br/><br/>One such look originates from Thrand as he watches the skeleton with the messenger from a short distance away. While from what the messenger said it would seem like Nineteen wasn\u2019t involved, none could be certain. The fact they showed up at the same time didn\u2019t help Nineteen\u2019s case much either. \u201cOi, skeleton, come on over here.
