The doors are decorated with fiery motifs, as well as with an sign that dictates whether its open or closed.The inside is brightly illuminated and filled with benches and tables populated with vikings and Berserkers, attracted by the ale and mead and the chance to talk and place bets on upcoming fights. Although it\u2019s a rare occurance, Mineraali and the occasional Valkyrie can be met here, often there to simply place bets and speak with old friends.Upstairs several rooms are available to the occasional visitors, or to those who wish to disucss something in secret.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The local tavern of \u00cdskaldur, The Burning Blade, stands somewhere on the main road between the Gate and the Castle.
