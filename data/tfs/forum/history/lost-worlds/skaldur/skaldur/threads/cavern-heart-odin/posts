It's guarded at all times, although this is more of an honorary duty, as no native of the nation in their right mind would dare disrespect it. Citizens of \u00cdskaldur are allowed to enter the cavern freely, although none but those going through the Berserker Trials are allowed near it. The Heart creates a barrier preventing access through magical means, and foreigners are only allowed to view it on special exceptions.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/CXTBaNs.jpg"], "html": "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/CXTBaNs.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/>"}}
