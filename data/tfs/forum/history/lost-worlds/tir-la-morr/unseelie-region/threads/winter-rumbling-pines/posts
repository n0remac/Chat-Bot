The cheerful tweets of songbirds, the vixen calls of foxes and the bellowing of elk and deer fill the air as life takes its course, and a soft chilly breeze rustles the needles of the towering pines. That breeze carries upon it a flitting orange ball of light that appears above the trees, moving rapidly and bobbing back and fourth as if surveying the area. Abruptly, it dips down and dashes below the canopy, leaving a charred hole where it touches the needles, smoke rising from the spot as glowing orange embers creep, turning green growth to black ash.As the ball settles down upon the forest floor its blinding light dims, and the figure of a two foot tall woman appears in its wake. She is scantily clad in a pair of sheer red-orange harem pants that ride low on her otherwise bare legs, her bare feet adorned with beaded anklets, and a strap of cloth fashioned into a sort of cropped halter top wrapped about her upper torso, barely preserving her dignity. A pair of jagged, pointed butterfly wings sprout from her back, fluttering gently in the cool breeze. Her eyes are solid gently-glowing orange and her hair is a flowing mass of what almost appears to be fire, constantly in motion, regardless of the wind. When her feet touch the grassy forest floor, they leave charred black marks, smoke rising from where she stands.\"Let's see here...\" she murmurs to herself, peering about inquisitively. \"Too many old trees. Choking new growth. Stagnation. No good!\"She rises back up into the air and begins to flit from pine to pine, laying hands upon each one. As her fingers brush against the bark, sparks fly and wood slowly begins to burn, starting with small flames that work their way up the trunks, searing the bark and the needles, as well as any creature too slow or too unaware to move in time. It's not long before the fires she creates begin to spread, tongues of flame licking at surrounding trees and setting them aflame, that process continuing one old pine after another. It won't be long until a great portion of the forest goes up, unless someone intervenes, and fast.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "It's midday in the Rumbling Pines.

Strapped to his saddle was his head, black eyes staring at the destruction around him. Both the steed and its rider had no fear of the flames themselves, but this forest was an important territory shared by two houses. He sought only to quell their destruction. Pulling on the reins, he reared the undead horse back, allowing the creature to let out a chilling howl unbefitting of its nature.It was then that the ground began to tremor.Forever roaming the fields that lay just beyond the pines, the giants of Winter, responsible for spreading frost to the border, stampeded in. The dullahan rode past them after directing them to the burning trees. \"Take your attention to the fire. I shall take care of the perpetrator!\" he commanded, and the frost giants pushed forward to do just that.Treasach urged forward, searching for the one who spread the flames. Was this an attack by Summer? No, Lonan would not order such a thing knowing his position. Perhaps Spring was behind this one. They were a mystery, still. This could have been their way of letting themselves be known.Up in the trees, the dullahan spotted a figure flitting through the branches. Without hesitation, he cracked his whip toward her.
