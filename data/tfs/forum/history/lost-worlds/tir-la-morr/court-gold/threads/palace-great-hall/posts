He cared not how Lonan comported himself in word so long as the Summer Lord did as he was told. The Tyrant knew that trying to crush the flippancy from the Seelie was a fruitless endeavor and would not waste breath chastising the once king. However, a reminder of the potential cost of disobedience was certainly fitting. The Tyrant's punishments on those who disobeyed him were quickly becoming the stuff of legends and nightmares. \"Morrigan has been delayed but we will start without her.

He did not particularly care that the Autumn Queen had spoken out of turn, to expect Fae to honor all but the most basic speaking order was pointless. However, her questioning of a fellow ruler in regards to his will was not to be tolerated. Now those burning embers turn upon Hayzea displeasure creeping into his voice.\"Isolde will tear down the crags on her own. Do not interfere in this Hayzea or you will draw my ire.\"The destruction of the crags would help cement the idea that the Winter court was now part of a larger kingdom. It also served as a lesson for Isolde, having the new Winter Queen destroy what was left of her sister's legacy was a potent reminder of The Tyrant's power and Isolde's subservience. It may brew animosity within Isolde as well but that was fine, he desired obedience and fear and the latter could not exist without hate.Still, he was not overly worried about Hayzea disobeying him on this, the Autumn Queen was loyal. However, she was also unstable. He was well aware of the tactics she'd used to quell rebellion in her court. They were not dissimilar to his own methods but she lacked his cold calculating malice. If she became more erratic she may prove to be a problem, unpredictability was good but if it slipped into insanity then it could no longer be controlled. The Tyrant had no use for something he could not control.Lonan's report was the most detailed but that was not a surprise. The Sidhe had been ruling his court for eons prior to The Tyrant's conquest. The king's movements were in line with The Tyrant's own designs but he was no fool. The Tyrant could see how the same actions Lonan was taking in his name could help the summer king in eventual rebellion. Of his underlings, Lonan posed the most potential trouble but the Summer King's experience also made him an invaluable asset. \"I am pleased with your progress.\"The Tyrant's burning embers once again take them all in. They likely knew as well as he that their reports were largely superfluous. If they did not already know of the spies The Tyrant had within their houses then they likely had suspicions. But the gain of information was rarely the reason a king called his Dukes and Duchesses to court. Part of it was to remind them of their place, to make sure they never forgot they were at his beck and call. But the real reason was to hand out new directives. But they would get to that.

The final voice that in those ringing words is as quiet as a whisper yet it can be heard as distinctly as the others. It speaks of dark and sinister things of ancient secrets and promises of power in exchange for obedience. Those gathered would be familiar with this odd phenomenon and those who treated with him often in the past, such as Hayzea would know his normal voice contained these three tones. However, they were usually muddled together and not so distinct. It was only when he gave an official proclamation or worked his magic that they split.
