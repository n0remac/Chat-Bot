Seemingly overnight this golden structure grew within the heart of Tir la Morr atop a large plateau that was once a meeting ground for the old courts. How it was made and of what is a mystery. The substance used in the palace's construction appears to be gold but lacks that metals malleability, a trait it keeps even when exposed to anti-magic. Either way, The Palace is grand and those who seek entrance should start here.

On had been watching the clouds the other had been observing the city that surrounded the plateau. When the man presents the scroll one takes it and pretends to read it while the other pretends to listen. \"Well, this is all in order.\" The one with the scrolls says whacking it with his hand. \"Ayup and the captain said that there'd be one more today. So you can go on through Vanhin.\" The second's tone suggests he knew the elder fae. Not impossible when you lived for centuries you tended to meet almost everyone and Vanhin was pretty famous.
