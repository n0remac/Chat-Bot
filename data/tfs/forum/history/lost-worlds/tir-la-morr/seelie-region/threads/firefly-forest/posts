It is a fairly large forest, packed densely with trees that range from very old to ancient judging by their appearance. As the name suggest, when the sun sets, the forest still remains quite well lit due to the swarms of fireflies that inhabit it. Although there are no towns or villages in the forest and the only structure of note is Vanhin\u2019s cottage and various ruins, a rather sizable number of Fae inhabit the forest, content to simply live under Vanhin\u2019s protection.\u00a0\u00a0Clean fresh water is quite abundant in the forest, coming from small creeks and streams that wind their way through the maze of trees. The trees themselves are constantly moving and shifting, resulting in the forest never being quite the same from one day to the next. The forest is also home to a wide variety of forest critters and birds, many of which travel from far away to raise their young in it. At times, those inside the forest will hear the sound of Vanhin playing his flute, which is rumored to be how travelers will know they have entered his forest.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/IVi5jYN.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/IVi5jYN.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/></div>"}}
