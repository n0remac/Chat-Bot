It is a rather plain two-story home with a thatched roof and walls of wattle and daub. On most days, smoke can be seen rising from a small brick chimney and the smell of roasted meats and other various dishes tempt those who pass nearby the cottage. In front of Vanhin\u2019s home lies a small pond filled with a water reminiscent\u00a0of sapphire in color. A small bridge of stone crosses an offshooting stream and leads to the path up to the front door of the cottage. Flowers of a variety of brilliant colors dot the landscape around the building, all of them clearly being carefully tended to.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/nOAgR8x.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/nOAgR8x.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/></div>"}}
