She looks at the two of them, lingering on Lisere. The thoughts going through her mind are obvious. Aesen was in a finely made black suit so he must be some nobles son. Lisere was pretty but very exotic. So she figures they must be eloping in defiance of Aesen's family. That isn't her business though. \"Do you have the fee?\"\"Yes we do.\"Aesen hands over a crisp banknote for the notary fee. The woman takes it makes note of the payment then heads into the back. A few minutes later she comes out with the contract.\"Would you mind witnessing?\"Aesen asks the woman. The woman is only slightly surprised by this.
