Most farming is impossible here, but there are some 'crops' that can be grown here. Blue oxen graze in fields of blue wheat , whilebgolden boar roam the forests for berries and smaller prey. Bears passed through either, searching for meat or plant so that it could be ready for the soon to be winter. Birds of many kinds found refuge in the fields and forests, feasting on the mass amounts of honeybees  and grasshoppers that buzzed across the land. Life was plentiful here in this massive crater, and like the blue wheat, no matter how much is gathered from it, within days it is replenished.Abandoned villages dot the landscape, but not a soul around to call it home. Everything is left as it was, filled with skeletons. It is unknown what awaits the hunters who stumble across these ghost towns, their horror and escape changing for each visitor.The Garden of Valhalla is two kilometers north of the camp and covers  the entire expanse till running into their borders along the rest of Aozora.If you have found this land in the south,younow stand on a ridge overlooking all this, your first step is to get down to this paradise that calls your name. If you come from the north, you stand on a ridge  with less than  a  fifty meter drop.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/287829722287570946/288178028809551882/large-vistas-space-down-below-meadows-fields-forests-se-villages-seen-top-high-mountain-photo-taken-tatra-mountains-36315138.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><b><font face=\"courier new\" size=\"4\">Garden of Valhalla</font></b></div>"}}
