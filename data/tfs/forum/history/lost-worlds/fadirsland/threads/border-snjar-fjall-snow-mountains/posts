These mountains run into another chain of mountains in Aozora, and protects the Garden of Valhalla. These mountains are the Northwest border.Skadi Elves are the inhabitants of the Snow Mountains.Skadi Elves are female, short, and love to ski. Overall, they are a peaceful race that is rarely seen. It is said a landv\u00e6ttir lives among them in the form of a dreki(dragon) that protects the mountains and all those who inhabit it peacefully.\u00a0These elves worship Modir and Fadir. They have no tolerance for magic, not even healing on their lands. Using their white bodies for camouflage, these elves will torment any unwelcomed visitors that try to pass through the mountains if magic is sensed, and killing them on sight if magic is in use or used.This is a strict NPC race that cannot be played by anyone but a DM with permissions If one was to try and leave, they would know and kill them when they had the thought. These elves can also be called the Daughters of Skadi.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/288060096846757899/288089201042391041/earth-landscape-spring-wildflower-canada-lake-mountain-reflection-appealing-wallpaper-88393-14297743537.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><font face=\"courier new\" size=\"6\"><b><u>Snjar Fjall</u></b></font></div>"}}
