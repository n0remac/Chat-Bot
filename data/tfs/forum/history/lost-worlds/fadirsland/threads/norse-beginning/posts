Their ships were blasted by hail, destroying sails and knocking out paddlers. There was little the vikings could do to defend themselves as they were smacked in the face by ocean waves and their backs beaten by hail. Their determination allowed them to look beyond the pain and continuing on with their duty to press forward. No Viking warrior with the duty of fighting this storm would attempt to hide; withthe Karl's paddling and the Jarls leading, they all vowed to die honorably. Fighting the storm for their cause, the vikings never let the thought of defeat penetrate their mind or faith.One by one the the storm knocked every Viking out and sunk many of the ships. One of the last vikings standing with his eyes open was Argimos. His right leg planted on nose of the ship which was the back of the dragons head decoration with the growing green flame, casting an image worthy to be painted. Green flames to left and right were consumed one by one, and yet he never turned to look at any of them.When the lighting started to strike the ocean and waterspouts split the clouds, Argimos took notice just as the few others who still could bare witness did. The wind began to blow even more vigorously, throwing bigger waves over the ships, claiming more and more \u00a0of the unconcious vikings. Cold winds clashed with warm winds while the clouds above started to spiral above the fleet, placing the water spouts and lightning among the portion of the fleet still above water.\u00a0The last second sArgimos would remember, or anyone else still awake, was a glimpse of three gods; Thor, Aegir, Hodr. Their godly figures appeared thirty meters ahead of Argimos, each with their weapons clashing. A wave of powerful magic ripped through the fleet and calmed the oceans for seconds. Argimos stood tall as his armor rolled the magical force dispersed itself evenly around him. Behind the wave of magic came three more waves of elements that hit simultaneously; first was a wave of frigid air that turned water instantly to ice, followed by a wave of lightning, and ended by a massive wave that revealed a gigantic whirlpool. Argimos stood proud as the ice first overtook his body, instantly turning his blonde and silver beard to a giant icecicle. No word could pass his mind before the wave of lightning passed through the ice and sent Argimos backwards, tossing him into the broken mast. After slamming his head, his eyes opened up only to see a tidal wave come crashing down upon him.Argimos couldn't move, his body paralyzed from the lightning wave, and now the piece of wood shrapnel lodged in his right arm pit that pierced into his shoulder. The Viking sunk, his eyes only seeing his bubbles and falling comrades in the green light still shining from the green fire in the dragon maw of the ship. The raiding Jarls mind refused to fade, fighting death to the last second, believing he would die from the injuries cast on him by the clash of gods and not by giving into the ocean.\u00a0Even though he believed he was dead, he took hold of his beard with his left hand and began to pray, \"Se, det ser jeg min far, ogSe, det ser jeg min mor, ogSe, det ser jeg mine br\u00f8dre og mine s\u00f8stre ogSe, det ser jeg mitt folk tilbake til begynnelsen, ogLo de kaller for meg, ogbyd meg ta min plass blant dem i hallene p\u00e5 Valhalla,Hvor modig vil leve evig.\"By the last word of his prayer, his eyes closed and the cold chill of death overtook his body. Argimos could feel his body shutting down as he slowly passed away. He'd open his eyes one more time to see a woman's face with a fish tale. Her body glowed like an angel in the green light, and then his eyes shut for good. The whirlpool forming where the ships fell started to pull everything. This was the last feeling Argimos felt as his body went into shock and shut down completely.Much later that day...Seagulls squawked and dolphins chirped up and down the coastline. The Sun was bright and the light it cast beat down on the golden sands and crystal blue waters. Palms and coconut tree branches shook as the warm seabreeze swept over the tropical paradise. Only one thing ruined the tropical escape; the wreckage of Viking ships and Viking bodies, spread out over miles of coastline.One of the last men to fall was one of the first men to wake. The sounds and feelings of the beach first brought him to his senses, but when he went to move his right arm, pain shot through his body and his upper body shot up to release a yell of pain. When he conquered his pain as best that a Viking could, he looked at the beaches, tears pooling in his eyes as he thought of all the dead people who sought a new life, while mixing with the pain his shoulder.  Argimos closed his eyes and prayed they all found Valhalla. When his short mental prayer was finished, he focus on the wood jabbed in his shoulder. Argimos stood up and looked for a small piece of wood he could place in his mouth to bite on, something he quickly found. With wood in his mouth to clamp on, he took hold of the shrapnel in his shoulder with his left hand and gently started to pull on it. Grunts and tears filled the vikings eyes, and with one good tug the wood came out with blood behind it. The wood in his mouth splintered as grunts and screams could be heard behind the clamped teeth on the wood. When the pain faded and numbness took over him, he searched the bodies along the beach to find something to wrap around his wound.As Argimos wondered the beach, he searched and shouted for any survivors. The Viking hoped that he wasn't the only to survive, and he wasn't. Others started to wake, all confused and all in pain.\u00a0After ten others had been found alive, Argimos took a knee and so did the others,\"Ullr!Til deg gir jeg takkfor dine velsignelser og beskyttelseGjennom tidene for chill og gale.Freyja!Til deg gir jeg takkfor dine velsignelser og healingN\u00e5r jeg er svak og blek.Odin!Til deg gir jeg takkfor dine velsignelser og veiledningN\u00e5r jeg er uvitende og tapt.Skadhi!Til deg gir jeg takkfor dine velsignelser og hevnN\u00e5r jeg er fort\u00e6rt eller krysset.Tyr!Til deg gir jeg takkfor dine velsignelser og offerGjennom tider med ondskap og usikkerhet.Bragi!Til deg gir jeg takkfor dine velsignelser og elocutionGjennom tider av romantikk og diplomati.Freyr!Til deg gir jeg takkfor dine velsignelser og begj\u00e6rGjennom tider av romantikk og hengivenhet.Thor!Til deg gir jeg takkfor dine velsignelser og styrkeN\u00e5r jeg utfordret og brutt.Idunn!Til deg gir jeg takkfor dine velsignelser og handlekraftN\u00e5r jeg er trist og trett.Hel!Til deg gir jeg takkfor dine velsignelser og roN\u00e5r jeg er tynget og rasende.Mine guder, jeg takker degFor disse enrichments som du gir!Hagl til deg, min gud!\"As the prayer finished, the survivors continued their search for others before they worried about the dead. No supplies remained and only a few ships were still afloat, but incapable of being used until major repairs were made. With so much destruction and suffering surrounding them, the living vikings were not in a mental state of despair or worry, they believed they fought the ocean and won. Those that passed, passed in belief they died honorably fighting the ocean as an enemy and refusing to bow to the watery wake of death it brought upon them.And in the Viking way, the honorable race pushed forward with the belief that nothing could stop a Viking, not even an ocean wrought with blood lust.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/89/6b/80/896b806244e4245f967efbbaec65a297.jpg", "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-nRKoNtEafH8/VZrcVqeOt-I/AAAAAAAATtU/EQGu-ySWJ_8/s640/blogger-image-1600611230.jpg", "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DGIXT7ce3vQ/maxresdefault.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/89/6b/80/896b806244e4245f967efbbaec65a297.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/></div>"}, "post-60208": {"user": "K\u00f6lla Jalsefni", "user_num": 2097, "timestamp": "1487029204000", "message": "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A nightmare; whatever this was, it was a nightmare. The wreckage, the dead, and the odd, calm sway of the ocean waves quietly crashing upon the shore. The blue sky, the bright sun, it contrasted what one would think to be Hell, except for the great heat that vibrated the air. Hell was the only thing K\u00f6lla could contribute as an adjective to what she saw on the shore.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hundreds of lifeless, limp men, some of the strongest she'd ever met, lost everything because of a bit too much water in their lungs. The lack of blood confused K\u00f6lla; her vital understanding of death usually included a red outline. But such red found itself absent from this scene. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was a mistake to come out, K\u00f6lla thought to herself, taking a glance over her shoulder into the bowels of the ship that once gave her passage across the great sea. Only, her eyes met not the wooden scraps of a broken dream, but rather the wooden scraps of a plank that broke under pressure and dug itself into her shoulder. The grain of the dark wood split itself around a knot, and then presumably sharpened to a point; presumably because it was veiled by her bloody clothes and the meat it had tore into.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was only when K\u00f6lla noticed the red she wanted to see upon the beaches that she felt the pain of a foreign object dug into her upper left body. She fell to her knees at this new information, holding in the vile scream that begged for release; ultimately, a whimper snuck through her lips and while she writhed against the sand below her that whimper raised to a violent yell that cut itself short.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then, it all fell dark, and for two hours her consciousness nodded between the decision of being awake and being asleep. Death himself seemed to have her life and her death in two different hands; like he was weighing the pros and cons of the two, before he finally choose life. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The bright, yellow sand that permeated the shore stuck to her bloody neck, but freely fell from her face as her journey to shade began; the tree-line was her goal, and later it would be water, but that was not important for now. With great trouble, she shakily took strength on her knee, using it to push herself up. With that, her seemingly broken body ricketed itself to that scarce shade under the green, thriving plant, and sat itself down on a hot grey rock. A cicada screamed its mating call, and K\u00f6lla began looking at her options.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was either die, or rip that piece of wood out and somehow keep it from leaking all of her remaining blood. K\u00f6lla meandered around the subject of grasping the broken half plank with her hand; it wasn't something she was ready to just do. It gave her goosebumps even thinking about slightly moving the thing. After ten minutes of failing to simply grab the wood, she gave up and looked at her now bloodied hand.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I think I'll be fine dying like this. The pain stopped,\" K\u00f6lla said to nobody but the insects around her, and maybe God. \"It's damn uncomfortable, but, I guess that's life. Give me oblivion...\" she wasn't really sure who to ask that from. Thor? Jesus? She finalized her sentence with, \"Somebody,\" and rested her head against a bigger boulder that dwarfed the rock she initially sat on.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>"}, "post-60215": {"user": "Iruka Naudir", "user_num": 1811, "timestamp": "1487037680000", "message": "The shapeshifter, Iruka Naudir, had managed to survive the crash of the ship he was on.

The only sound heard under the collaborative \"Rad, Rad, Rad\" was the oars splashing against the ocean. The sounds of the waves crashing against them and the wind beating against the sails had inured the men to the violence of the open waters. On days past whole ships had collided and been swallowed by Njord whose name the men of the Snekkja \"Wildsar\" had begun to curse. It became apparent that Njord was no ally of theirs on this voyage, however a foe.The morning had broken to clear skies and it was obvious Njord had to recuperate from unrelenting assault the Vikings and he had fought. The crew of Wildsar seated forty, ten oars were empty where Njord reached up and dragged his victims into his watery halls. \"Rad. . . Rad . . . Rad . . .\" The chant had died down considerably as those left had slowed pace to a lazy list. The men took turns dropping their lines in the water. Raw fish helped to supplement\u00a0the men and women's near-depleted rations. On one of the oars in the front Raunganga Leggrmen sat with his face soaking in the sun.\u00a0Raunganga was a man of middling height he did not stand taller, nor did he stand shorter than his counterpart. With a dirty blonde ponytail and a dual braided beard he sat dressed in simple cloth rags, drenched from\u00a0his prolonged travel, bone\u00a0ornaments hung from his arms legs and neck.\u00a0 He held in his hand a freshly scaled and filleted Haddock. Gently he busied himself with the creature's frame trying to pull apart two bones when the boat gave a violent kick and the fish broke in two. \"Double time!\" A voice called, \"Rad, Rad Rad!\"'It's huge' A voice from behind mumbled as another began to pray.Raunganga cursed, picked up his oar and began to row. A tidal wave loomed in the distance rushing right for the Viking fleet. The air chilled and the water dropped and a mist kicked up as the bones strung up to the Wildsar clattered against each other.The wave smashed into the boat and Wildsar was thrown sideways. Raunganga felt himself being thrown over his oar, sideways two rows up he collided with another viking. His body was a rag doll as his hands groped for something to grab ahold of. Water rushed over him, stealing the breath from his lungs. His body shook as a feeling of urgency overtook him. \"This is it, I am coming for you Valhalla\" He said as two of his comrades were dragged upward, and washed away. He could feel himself coughing only inhaling water as he went limp. WHOOSH!. . . The boat crested the tidal wave and slammed against the surf. The rowers were haphazard and some were missing. Another wave, not quite as big came on and nearly resubmurged the vessle. Raunganga still felt himself suffocating, gasping for air until he felt a boot to his back. \"Your debt to the gods is not yet paid.\" It was one of his kin he realized as he retched against the planks of the boat. It was in that moment, laying face down, struggling to rise he felt the toll fighting this watery battle had exacted on his body. He retched again, spewing saltwater and bile from his stomach against the floor before attempting to stand and was thrown into a seat. \"Rad, rad, rad, rad, rad, rad\" He rhasped meekly, his voice gone from him. Suddenly he saw it.\"Portside, stop!\" He heard his voice break as some of it returned to him. The storm stood still and he caught a glimpse of what looked to be a bright light in front of another longboat and a wave in the distance freezing the water in its path. The woodsman rushed to the portside and grabbed one of the men,\u00a0wrestling\u00a0him to the Starboard side to fill an empty seat. \"Thor give us strength, MOVE!\" The oars fought the water as the vessle spun away from the wave. \"Port push!\" The crew shouted, mustering what they had left of their strength to row with all of their might. The wave moved past, freezing the water inch by inch, encasing the last ten feet of the stern in ice just catching the ass end of the ship. The crew jolted forward. Another wave was rushing forward, and using the energy of the ships abrupt halt Raunganga flung himself from his seat and ran to the stern. He ripped a fingerbone from his necklace and flung it into the ice. The ship bucked forward violently as the ice cracked away and shriveled back a couple of feet.\"Push!\" Raunganga heard the Jarl shout near the bow of the boat. The crew started inching along slowly, as the next wave was near on top of the Wildsar. The lack of momentum made rowing a grueling experience the wave was headed right for the ship. It was then that Raunganga could see the wave had lightning coursing through it, almost imbued with the water itself. His eyes grew wide as the wave just grazed the bow of the boat, sending it careening away from the path. The crew immediately tried to stabilize the vessle as it spun violently away from a huge wave revealing a whirlpool. Luckily the Wildsar was just out of range. Hail beat down against the exhausted crew relentlessly as they rowed on aimlessly. The surf never let up but the tidal waves ceased. \"There goes Niraxees!\" Raunganga heard a woman shout out from behind. He turned and saw the wreckage of a skeid get taken by the current of the whirlpool. There was a sudden 'CRACK' loud enough to be a thunderstrike as the ship snapped in two and collapsed in on itself being swallowed by the whirlpool. Raunganga leaned forward and pressed his head against the oar in his hand, letting out a primal yelp of sorrow that lead off in short sobs. He began to fight against the wake of the storm once more only giving himself a moment to gather himself. His mind had been blank up until this point as he thought back to his shelter in the Naddovellir outskirts. Going on hunts and returning to praise and laughter. This was a grim ordeal. Many different ships had set out from all over the Nordic territory and each was different. While some took to intense prayer others took the oppurtunity to gorge on ale, already fantasizing about the songs to be sang, on\u00a0some ships old blood fueds were reunited and holmgangs performed. The Wildsar however was mostly quiet, everyone on it had an intense air of purpose in what they were doing. They were all for the most part woodsmen, and the Jarl of the boat\u00a0was not even a real Jarl, nor had been given the name until the first storm the crew had endured. The man distinguished himself by keeping a clear head and turning back when a Karvi had tipped over and spilled its crew into the water.\u00a0\u00a0Raunganga snapped back into reality as a bolt of lightning crashed into their sail and the wooden mast came toppling down. He froze, struck by fear and looked toward the skies. Thor himself was fighting against this voyage. He looked back toward his task and continued to row against the endless ocean, shaken. \"Gulls!\" A voice rose among a sleeping crew. Raunganga sprung awake. After breaking off from the storm the crew of the Wildsar sprawled out and slept. Gulls! It was true. He could hear the squawking now. . . Land. . . The gull circled ahead, inspecting the boat, before calling out and swooping back toward its home. Far in the distance\u00a0a faint outline;\u00a0breaking the monotony of the horizon could\u00a0just be made out when the crew of the Wildsar squinted hard.\u00a0Everyone remounted their oars and plunged their paddles into the water. \"Rad . . . rad . . . rad . . . \"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<br>The horizon stretched to infinity, the sky melding with the water as the Viking fleet crawled onward. The only sound heard under the collaborative \"Rad, Rad, Rad\" was the oars splashing against the ocean. The sounds of the waves crashing against them and the wind beating against the sails had inured the men to the violence of the open waters. On days past whole ships had collided and been swallowed by Njord whose name the men of the Snekkja \"Wildsar\" had begun to curse. It became apparent that Njord was no ally of theirs on this voyage, however a foe.<br/><br/>The morning had broken to clear skies and it was obvious Njord had to recuperate from unrelenting assault the Vikings and he had fought. The crew of Wildsar seated forty, ten oars were empty where Njord reached up and dragged his victims into his watery halls. \"Rad. . . Rad . . . Rad . . .\" The chant had died down considerably as those left had slowed pace to a lazy list. The men took turns dropping their lines in the water. Raw fish helped to supplement\u00a0the men and women's near-depleted rations. <br/><br/>On one of the oars in the front Raunganga Leggrmen sat with his face soaking in the sun.\u00a0Raunganga was a man of middling height he did not stand taller, nor did he stand shorter than his counterpart. With a dirty blonde ponytail and a dual braided beard he sat dressed in simple cloth rags, drenched from\u00a0his prolonged travel, bone\u00a0ornaments hung from his arms legs and neck.\u00a0 He held in his hand a freshly scaled and filleted Haddock. Gently he busied himself with the creature's frame trying to pull apart two bones when the boat gave a violent kick and the fish broke in two. <br/><br/>\"Double time!\" A voice called, \"Rad, Rad Rad!\"<br/>'It's huge' A voice from behind mumbled as another began to pray.<br/>Raunganga cursed, picked up his oar and began to row. <br/>A tidal wave loomed in the distance rushing right for the Viking fleet. The air chilled and the water dropped and a mist kicked up as the bones strung up to the Wildsar clattered against each other.<br/><br/>The wave smashed into the boat and Wildsar was thrown sideways. Raunganga felt himself being thrown over his oar, sideways two rows up he collided with another viking. His body was a rag doll as his hands groped for something to grab ahold of. Water rushed over him, stealing the breath from his lungs. His body shook as a feeling of urgency overtook him. \"This is it, I am coming for you Valhalla\" He said as two of his comrades were dragged upward, and washed away. He could feel himself coughing only inhaling water as he went limp. <br/><br/>WHOOSH!. . . The boat crested the tidal wave and slammed against the surf. The rowers were haphazard and some were missing. Another wave, not quite as big came on and nearly resubmurged the vessle. Raunganga still felt himself suffocating, gasping for air until he felt a boot to his back. \"Your debt to the gods is not yet paid.\" It was one of his kin he realized as he retched against the planks of the boat. It was in that moment, laying face down, struggling to rise he felt the toll fighting this watery battle had exacted on his body. He retched again, spewing saltwater and bile from his stomach against the floor before attempting to stand and was thrown into a seat. \"Rad, rad, rad, rad, rad, rad\" He rhasped meekly, his voice gone from him. Suddenly he saw it.<br/><br/>\"Portside, stop!\" He heard his voice break as some of it returned to him. The storm stood still and he caught a glimpse of what looked to be a bright light in front of another longboat and a wave in the distance freezing the water in its path.

Many found themselves asking the basic questions of where they were and how were they alive. As the vikings rose one by one they spread out to tend to bodies. Rows of bodies formed across the beach,  running in a pattern that looked like train tracks. As more vikings stood, they began using their weapons as tools to chop down trees, creating large piles in multiple spots on the sand.The vikings cutting the trees didn't take down random trees. They had actually cleared out an entire flat to build a camp. Some vikings continued to chop and stockpile the wood while others began removing what supplies they could from the ships that were destroyed along the coast in shallow waters. Some ships weren't able to be reached at first, but they were removing wood from the ships to build one ship. The palm and coconut trees wouldn't be able to be used for anything besides burning. Everyone was doing something; some laid out bodies, some cleared out land of growth, and others checking on those still not standing. All were beaten and bruised, but these vikings weren't going to let this stop them from doing what they had to to survive.Argimos was coming up on the last stretch of shore that had bodies still on the ground. The surviving population was between four hundred and five hundred. Most that stood were the hardiest of the bunch and their minds the sharpest and strongest. The idea took him a minute to piece together, but he thought on the scene of the gods during the storm. His theory was that the gods chose who to survive, his mind forgetting the last second before all went black. Argimos cracked open a coconut and started to eat it while he thought deeper into the god theory. His eyes would look over the survivors many times, but by the time he finished off his coconut, he really took notice of who survived and how well they worked together. In a situation like this, most would build separate villages, but every Viking worked as one, showing no distaste against another village; no matter their homeland.One Horn began to play with the broken horn in his helm. Making his way back down the shore, he noticed the two who were now there that were not just an hour ago. Argmios's nose began to sniff the air and licked his lips; the raider could smell and taste magic in the air. It was only when he saw one of his Viking comrades being healed did he have a second thought. Argimos slid behind the magic user and placed his hammer between their shoulder blades.\"barmhjertighet funnet din sjel i dag. fortell meg din historie ... fordi jeg er ikke barmhjertighet.\"\u00a0Cutting off the magic user, Argimos peered over to the Viking woman, \"har du det bra?\"__________________________Further up the coast one last ship came through, one that was rattled by the weather, but in all aspects, it was completely usable. On it came one last group of raiders, a group that was just a tad bit more aggressive when it came to their raiding.

The closer they got the more destructive the force, ships were already beginning to slow to his left and to his right where cowards refused to go honorably into war, but it did not matter. They would be the ones left to a shameful death in the netherworld of Loki's daughter, but at least they were spared the hellish ice the froze his form solid. A wintery wave at least ninety degrees below zero spread across the fleet turning Everyman into but an ice sculpture and from that a strike of Mj\u00f6lnir sent a shockwave so powerful that all men were scattered across or off their ships, but not the White Wolf. He was thrown back, his gargantuan body hitting hard on the mast to the point that his head whiplashed back into the wood setting his vision black. For several key moments he tried to regain himself, but upon getting his senses back he would see the titanic wave coming to take him away . . . He should submit . . . He should let the water wash him away . . . But that's not the Viking way . . . For paradise you must fight till death, and fight he would. The man arose to his feet and began to recite a prayer to the gods, but one that had been changed for him personally,\"Lo, detM\u00e5 jeg se min far.Lo, detM\u00e5 jeg se min mor.Lo, detM\u00e5 jeg ser en linje av mitt folkTilbake til begynnelsenLo der,Har de roper til meg, deres stemmer ulvene hyle,Lo der,M\u00e5 jeg se Odin,Og s\u00e5 han kaller p\u00e5 meg,Sl\u00e5ss till dagen er vunnet. \"Once his mantra was complete the transformation of a Berserker took place, his entire body was covered in the black living mesh that was the berserkers cowl. In his black armor he rushed to the front of the ship with his arms out wide to embrace the wave as he howled out,\"Videre!\"And no sooner did he scream than did the wave overcome him and crush his ship beneath it, swatting the vessel away as if it was nothing more than a gnat. . . Little did they know that while this wave would knock him unconscious and cast him adrift, that the strength of the wave would make him stronger. It would make him better, surely this was Odin's plan to make his loyal Berserker even greater . . . Sometime later . . . .How long hard the darkness consumed him? How long had he been asleep? Why was it still so dark? Oh, his eyes were still closed. Pale lids peeled open to reveal xanthous optics, \"Hodet mitt.\" Slowly his arms would find their baring in the sand beneath him as he pushed his hulking form onto his hands and knees, his hand slowly sifted through the sand to find his ax as his legs searched for their bearings and. At last he would stand upon the beach and cast his eyes around the beach at his hundreds of fallen brothers before hanging his head, at least they had gotten to Valhalla, but now was the time to act. He looked around for some of the other ship leaders he was aware of, the main sight he saw was One-Horn, a woman, and a man using . . . Magic!? That healer deserved death, but she was helping a sister so he would have to wait.

Good had been done for the Viking cause and this magic user was a Viking.

Although she had no jarldom, or any sense of money, there was once a time where she had a loyal crew, and a longship to boast control of the sea. Her feet rippled through the sticky red sand where she had rested at one point, and then she found the mouth of the destruction of her old life; the hull of the ship, which in all honesty, looked very similar to a madman's face as it laughed at the illusions of its own mind.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 K\u00f6lla hadn't seen a single member of her band, and unlike the other Vikings she did not think that their deaths were beautiful and awe inspiring, or that they now sit in the great halls of Valhalla; she was not so easily convinced to push her sorrow into happiness. So, her grief manifested itself in the way her eyes laid upon the broken spears and shields that once held onto the sides of her ship, the spears and shields that once testified their power. If only martial prowess transferred to swimming.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This was no longer her ship. There was no band to sing songs with. Nobody had her back anymore. K\u00f6lla was alone, on an island, with an uncountable amount of Vikings. The thought ran through her mind more than once as she searched for her crossbow in the wreckage, \"I've ought to find a way out of here.\" K\u00f6lla was not needed anymore; she had nothing but herself, and in this state, that was not something all that impressive. There wasn't anything she could really do about that though. This was a island. She had no ship. She had no friends.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Except for her crossbow. K\u00f6lla's grabbing hands pulled the wooden contraption out from under a post. Miraculously, it was unscathed; it wasn't even wet, and the bow string was pretty tense. Twisting a lever on the right side of the crossbow, she pulled the string back and after a few moments secured a thick bolt into the notch. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The water swished in the deeper parts of the hull, quietly, but just loud enough to be heard over the clamour the people on the beach were making. K\u00f6lla found herself resting with the lulls of waves. There was no clear future as to what her future had in store, but it probably would not be good. For a second, she thought about turning the bow on herself, and meeting her friends in whatever afterlife there might be, but cowardice proved itself stronger than her sadness and she strapped the crossbow over her unhurt shoulder.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Don't I have a job to do? Maybe if I do it good enough I won't be just a girl to be raped, but a viable asset.\" K\u00f6lla laughed, and found a large burlap tarp, which she wore as a cloak; her white skin was not made for sunny days, and maybe it would hide her features well enough to not have anybody make the mistake of calling her woman again. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Off to work she began, stealing an axe from a dead man's body to chop down the smaller trees that were more fit for arrows and spears. There were plenty of rocks and stones to grind into spear and arrow heads, and well, she spent the rest of the day working. Woodwork and construction were no foreign concepts to her, in fact, anybody with half a brain when they saw the products of her labor would understand that she was trained. Instead of tying the rocks to the wood like any other dumb Viking, she spent several minutes on every spear, slicing implicit incisions where the heads would slide in, and stay. At the end of the day, she made 53 strong, hardy spears and double that in arrows. Granted, she did not stop at the end of the day; she worked into the night, moving away from camp and to the skeletal remains of her ship when they found it right to stop working.

Men and women stood arm to arm and each spoke, clamoring. Some rejoiced, praised Thor and forgave Njord, others grieved their losses while some objected to this new land, claiming it was cursed. \"Brothers, sisters.\" A voice called from the back of the mob. Pushing his way through the crowd Raunganga made his way to the tip of the boat his cloth garb replaced with a near full suit of bone armor. \"If everyone here thinks what we just fought was the battle they've already lost. Don your armor, get ready for battle!\" He shouted at the top of his lungs with a primal hunger. He paused.\"We know\u00a0not what is ahead of us, if anybody survived if this land has people or monsters. Whatever happens, I know only this. The open water was just the journey we have a battle to fight!\" He began to bang his spear against the floorboards in rhythm. The crew came alive, the meeting transitioned into a stream of Vikings flooding to the cargo hold, donning their leathers bone stone and iron. . .Raunganga kept the rhythm, hoarsely shouting out commands as the Snekkja skimmed along the coastline scanning for survivors. The ship was alive with energy, people were stomping their feet and shouting, cursing and banging as they rowed along. The Wildsar came to an inlet as one of the Vikings shouted alarums. The Viking boat rowed right past a scene of men gathering dead and injured in a line. \"REVERSE!\" Raunganga shouted, his protective bones clanging against his ornamental loose ones as he thrust his whole body with the word. \u00a0 The men immediately began rowing in the\u00a0opposite direction and the symmetrical styled boat came to a near immediate halt, before reversing its course. The boat turned into the small inlet aroar with noise as only six more rowed. Everybody else stood, slamming the butts of their weapons down to the floorboards keeping pace with Raunganga. The sound could easily be heard a mile away. The ship\u00a0 crawled alongside the coast before stopping near a tree behind a rock bed. A woman vaulted from the vessel with a rope under her arm, clad in leathers and furs and a long Atgeir in her dominant hand. She tied the rope to the tropical tree as a large flat wooden walkway spilled over the side of the Wildsar. The entire crew let out primitive calls as they ran across the walkway, hungrily looking for an outlet to their new found energy. The party had the energy to wake even the dead as a body in the pile of corpses choked up a good deal of water and began violently coughing his lungs dry. The man was pale as a ghost as he sat up and turned to the party, who shouted approval at the man as he meekly put his fist in the air and contributed another coughing fit to the clamor. This only fed their morale.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Raunganga looked on now twitching in anticipation. That was omen enough for him. \"Everybody stick together, let the others raise the dead, they're doing it on their own anyway!\" He said\u00a0looking at the man who\u00a0was now refusing to allow\u00a0one of his kin help him up and rising on his own. \"This bay is ours now! Today we scout, take what food we find tomorrow we hunt!\" Raunganga's voice was high and already cracking from the strain he had already endured.\u00a0at least a dozen men and women in the party\u00a0were bone clad but\u00a0Raunganga's\u00a0garb stood out the most, he was the vision of death.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He and the party was clearly on a warpath as they began to march into the woods, four of the faster and lighter equipped breaking off to scout ahead. He knew it was not a very good move, they were all hungry and tired and knew nothing of the terrain, nobody even so much as attempted to get a situational report or so much as acknowledge another viking on the sands. This did not stop him from continuing forward, the party went forward and Raunganga leaned over to a wiry man with a gray unkempt face naked except for a fur tunic and a bronze shoulder pad with a matching ankle guard on his shield side.

Interwoven in the palm trees against the coast were small huts made for single vikings who didn't desire to be in the heart of the camp among others. Most of these huts were Karls who once had shops and other businesses in their homeland, but others were thralls who wanted to hide their face and break their chains to slavery; to become an upstanding Viking before they entered into the centralized Viking locations, Incase someone recognized them.Within the land that was logged, things had also progressed quickly. The addition of the giants quickly handled the logging aspect, allowing more people to build. An hour before the sun would set, skeleton structures filled the camp zone; consisting of supports and roofs. There was nothing pretty about the construction site, but the people felt safer from the weather. Small fires started to pick up around the the camp as people stopped working for the day. While it wasn't much, dinner for the night was mainly coconut unless they had the energy to get something to eat.In the giants search for a cave, they would stumble across two springs and a large cave. At the mouth of the cave was a large pool of pure water that had to be crossed to enter. In a search for a home, they found a necessity of survival; drinking water.The raiders of Raunganga who went on their own found very few animals to hunt, but they would catch a single boar creature.  Outside the aspect of food, they would find nothing but tropical plants and sand; no ruins, no paths, nothing. A beautiful scene with little ability to sustain life on its own.By sunset, everyone had stopped work and gathered on the shores for the mass cremation of their fallen Systkin. Fire was set to the piles of flesh and debris. The fire took off and the stench of burning flesh and thirty foot pillars of fire took over the senses. These fires would burn all night and keep the coast lit up while some kept watch for the night.Words were spoken and tributes paid, letting the people return to the camp and rest.

She had no allegiance to Thor or Odin, but she did have an allegiance to their ways. This allegiance, she came here to break it. The desire to annul her treaty she had with violence burned within her heart, but something held that desire under a locked key; it was hidden within a vault beneath the bank, where millions of transactions occurred a day.</span><br/><i><span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><br/></i></span></span></br></span></span>"}, "post-60999": {"user": "Ulrik Larsson", "user_num": 2104, "timestamp": "1488745449000", "message": "Ulrik overheard the speech, and could not help but growl a little under his breath.

He breathed in heavily, for he had to speak powerfully if he was too convey the respect for the old gods over.\u00a0\"I am Ulrik Sveinald, son of Lars. Hear me sons and daughters of war! The old gods gave us life, they gave us power! Wotan's strength courses through all of our veins, whilst the love of Freyja makes all of our hearts warm! What happened at sea, it was punishment! Punishment for weakness as a father scolds a son. We have not shown the devotion to Wotan and his family that they deserve, we have shamed them. See you the skies endless? That is the work of the Old Gods, not the new madness the Goths preach. They're drunk be it with bad ale or power but the truth remains that they speak of naught. The Old Gods watch over us, and they see these atrocities you do, your forgetfulness of your roots. They see you abandoning your makers, and they will bring punishment even greater! Avoid calamity, avoid our people dying. Wotan be praised! Down with the false gods!\"He stopped his roaring for a moment to catch his breath. From fury his eyes were red, and from the burn sun the skin around it making the man appear as a faceless daemon of some sort, aided by his armour and helmet's visor being decorated with all sorts of cryptic trinkets and items; even the shield on his back was still bloody from a face caved in. He looked around, and then continued.We must go, seek out new lands to go on Viking Raids, we must bring New Glory to the Old Gods!With that, he was done and jumped off the table to once more be part of \"the people\" though he kept his held up high should someone want to argue with him.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">Ulrik overheard the speech, and could not help but growl a little under his breath.
