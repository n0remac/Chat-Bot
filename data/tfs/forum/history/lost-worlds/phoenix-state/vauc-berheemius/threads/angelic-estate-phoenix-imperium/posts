A strange music bounced off the walls of the tunnel from which the boat came, and was now permeating the cavernous atmosphere surrounding it. It sounded a bit like a xylophone, but with a smoother, deeper texture. The woman responsible for the melody was middle-aged, tan, and covered in furs. She was carrying a baby on her back.Sangilak wondered what kind of people she was going to meet. Military generals were an unfamiliar concept to her people. All she knew was protecting her homeland and keeping promises. Her warrior spirit was fueled by the sanctity of life and the love that was demonstrated by mother earth and father sky. Her connection to the earth and its living creatures is what gave her strength, not the desire to conquer or kill. Maybe this was the reason why Elder Havador    had asked her to join the Phoenix Imperium, to bring a sense of honor and respect for human life to their campaigns.The child, Uglu, was sleeping peacefully. Sangilak understood that she wouldn't be able to take him on military campaigns, but that wouldn't preclude the promise she made to his deceased mother: guard him with your life. And guard him she would, to the best of her ability, not matter where she went. For anyone that threatened her or the people she cared about would face the wrath of mother earth and father sky.She continued to play her song on her shields as the estate loomed closer and closer to her. The baby enjoyed the music and was sleeping peacefully because of it. The rowing man appeared to enjoy it as well. He might not notice that after listening to the music that crick in his knee wouldn't bother him again for a long time.
