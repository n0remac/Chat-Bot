I was given a dream by Amun Ra of a fiery serpent. We believe it is a warning and we need to prepare. The walls of Vauc Berheemius are about to be raised, but we are deciding whether or not to begin resurrecting walls around the State. Whatever is going to happen, we need to prepare, we just need to decide what needs to be done first and where to begin stationing the men for possible combat. Whatever happens, it needs to be quick, no matter how much it costs...then we must discuss the tribes in the Gate of the Valheecius Desert, as their defenses will be lacking due to their small size.\"Promiethius turned to the group again, taking his position in the light, \"I say we raise periodic walls around the state, controlling what routes are available for heavy movement. They won't waste time destroying them, having no way to move the rubble for any equipment. We can use masons and terramorphers to build them. We can have the complete southern border completed in a month if we push hard enough. This means lots of food and water. We also have to think about the supplies being sent to the Free Plains for the fort.\"He listened as one being spoke, \"Dragon Season is in, so we have excess amounts of meat. We'll decrease the amount we export and use it to fuel the workers. As for the periodic walls, we can station one man per wall to light a large fire signal, in which all the walls will follow. We can use them for defense and a signal, letting us know if anything comes, be it a demon or an army. Like previously stated, we don't know what could be coming, so a warning would be nice. Also, with the reports, we can actually begin logging not to far out of the Gate. We can use this wood to begin work on our Navy. Our ships in the Black Sea are not made for travel in water, and our eastern and part of the north, are bordered by water. Just because it's fire, doesn't mean it couldn't come from the oceans...If you want walls, I want  a Navy.\"Promiethius spoke up again, \"And how long would it take for a successful naval structure? That's more strain on the economy...If I give you one month, could you have a fleet ready?\"The being responded, \"In one month, IF we can keep a steady flow of wood for that month, we can build three mediocre naval bases, nine large ships, eighteen smaller ships, and twelve medium ships. If our scouts are right, our eastern fleet could begin as soon as we get there, as it's wooded lands. We just can't use too much. It can be done.\"Promiethius nodded to the man before turning to Khan, \"As the representative in place of Grand General Sinn, is there anything you think may be needed to prepare for this unknown danger?

The only way i'll agree to such an absurd response is if we all join together, all branches, and act as the sole governing body. The only way we will survive anything is if we are one. The Scout Union will act as we always have and see what information we can get. If we can agree to place an S.U.I. in a few surrounding lands to see what's going on there, then, depending on the info, we can decide whether it's necessary to move quickly, or if we need to slow down and prevent destroying our economy for a month. On a good note, the Scout Union has opened trade with the Kingdom of Medan. This means we have our source of vegetation. The Land Tillers Expanse is also involved with us in talks of land and trade. Gold value is extremely high in the Land Tillers Expanse, so we could actually buy up land for farming and have their people work them. This would mean cheap land, cheap labor, high return. We'd have to build a fort there, but it would be cheaper to do this than import almost all our vegetation. So we will begin your missions, and in one week, return. In the next month, the Scout Union will begin making deals in the Land Tillers Expanse so we can fuel ourselves if necessary.

A small navy, large amounts of walls, and buying large chunks of land, all while we're already fueling a fort and trading post in the Free Plains and starting construction on a trade route to the Kingdom of Medan.

We may have plenty, but we can only mine so much at a time.\"Masu looked to the others, \"Well, the Gold Bear Tribe has spoken. I think what we have right now is enough.
