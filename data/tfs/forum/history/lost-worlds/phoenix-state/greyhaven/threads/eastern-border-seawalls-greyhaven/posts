The only way to reach this city by sea is by small paddleboats. The only cavern there is on this Seawall that is big enough for large ships is protected by the Phoenix Imperium Royal Navy. And troublemakers can expect to be caught by bunkers in the side of the cliffs with enchanted ballista and archers with fiery arrows.\u00a0The air here is nippy, as it sits not too far from a frozen tundra. The skies tend to stay cloudy and rain is regular. The people here have learned to make use of the sea for the vast majority of the food. Despite the rough look of the people beyond these Seawalls are very welcoming.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://slodive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/zbrush/cliffside_main.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://slodive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/zbrush/cliffside_main.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/></div>"}, "post-24838": {"user": "Goraia", "user_num": 76, "timestamp": "1456211060000", "message": "Invaders would indeed have much trouble scaling the cliffs in an amphibious assault on Greyhaven.It would seem strange, then, to any outsiders who witnessed the coming spectacle--a fleet of naval ships, bearing the new flags of Goraia, appeared on the horizon. Growing closer and closer, it seemed the people of Greyhaven had been prepared for such an event. While not everyone left their homes, those who desired to resettle or join with their leader Wolfgang would eventually board the ships with their belongings and families... all had been approved by Wolfgang as a cargo operation, though any Phoenix State naval resistance to what eventually unfolded to be the truth of mass exodus, would be met with firm military response in kind.
