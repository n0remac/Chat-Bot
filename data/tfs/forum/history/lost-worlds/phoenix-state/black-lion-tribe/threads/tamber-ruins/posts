When Rictzin and Jarkoopi first broke into his chamber, he thought that those who kept him trapped in the dark hall were releasing another animal to feed him. Enigma did not remember what happened after that, as undoubtedly he changed into his dragon form at the prospect of prey, his instincts having taken over. When he returned to his human form he was alone again, but something was different.\u00a0There were many new claw and scorch marks around the room and something else that seemed completely foreign to Enigma. A shaft of sunlight pieced through the darkness, illuminating the exit of the chamber. At first Enigma could not look at the light very long, even the brightness of this little sunlight blinding. After a long while though he managed to adjust to the light, and it utterly puzzled him, as much as it would puzzle someone who was blind their whole lives but could suddenly see once more. All at once he was introduced to tons of new dynamics of this world he hadn't ever experienced before. He could see colors, shapes, shadows, and of course, the light, which seemed the complete opposite to his old friend darkness.\u00a0It was then he saw his own hands in the light, and he sat there and looked at them for a long time, as well as the rest of himself. Enigma spent so much time marveling at his now brightened surroundings in fact Rictzin might have wondered if he would ever come up, but eventually he started to make his way towards the entrance. He had also found a cult member laying nearby, who was quite dead, but this did not seem to bother Enigma, and he needed new clothes since his previous garb was torn to shreds from his changing of forms. So, as Enigma slowly inched out towards the main chamber which had the opening in the ceiling to the open sky, he pulled the hood of the crimson robes he now wore over his head to block his eyes from the light.The opening to the sky was equally as marvelous as his first sight of light had been, and he couldn't help but steal a few glances straight up towards the bright blue sky before he would have to avert his gaze due to the brightness. As Enigma walked into the center of the room the elevator would begin to hum as it came back to life, seemingly triggered by Enigma's touch. He was so startled when he began to be lifted up towards the sky, he almost made to jump off of it before it raised him too high. He did not want to leave this place, this was has been his home his whole life, this place was familiar, outside was foreign. Rictzin's voice almost startled Enigma as much as the elevator's activation, but oddly he understood the words he said, yes... words, that is what they were called. It was similar to the sounds the lambs made when he caught them, but they were different, they had meaning.When Enigma emerged outside the ruins, he did not say a word to Rictzin, but instead peered around somewhat startled by his surroundings again, careful not to let the light get directly into his eyes past the hood pulled over his head. He saw trees, rocks, the outside of the ruins, Rictzin, and many others things. Rictzin seemed sort of familiar, his body was shaped like his but he was able to also see the parts of his body which he himself was not able to, albeit he had his face obscured. Enigma stared at Rictzin until he said something, his mismatched eye colors boring into the man. Did the voice he heard come from him or something else?
