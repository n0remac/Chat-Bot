Due to past events and the mass amounts of Dragonscale armor being produced, there has been a lack of need for their oil. The Golden Bear Tribe seems to be a large investor in this city, having a lean on the city. They are currently looking for someone to take the State Representative and High Druid positions.\u00a0The population is sad. Magic and past religions have brought this city to it's knees. Now, the only surviving religion was the Kiraxo Scrolls. Since the introduction of these scrolls, the city has cleaned up and learned how to smile in their despair. They knew their chance to be back on top would come, and each day they strive for it. Even if these people only half a loaf of bread, if a hungry traveler comes along, they will offer it to them.\u00a0Maybe you are the one who could bring this city back to glory? With a mass amount of oil and shale, their is a very good chance for a strong economy if the right trade routes were established. Maybe you can make these deals with surrounding lands? Maybe you could make the next magical breakthrough? Or maybe you could train the most powerful druids and mages of all time with the rich history and dedication to religion and magical sciences? If these things are what you are looking for, this is your opportunity.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://aetherforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Fan_Ming_01.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://aetherforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Fan_Ming_01.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}, "post-4284": {"user": "Arch General Promiethius", "user_num": 360, "timestamp": "1434332071000", "message": "Promiethius found himself outside the walls of Phoenix.
