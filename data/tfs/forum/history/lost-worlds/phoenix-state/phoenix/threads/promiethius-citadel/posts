The Six Faces and Amun Ra have blessed us again!\" One of the mages spoke out.The group scattered immediately, leaving Promiethius standing there. He would make his way to the top of the Citadel to a private chamber only he could access. With a magical chant, the lock clicked and he entered his chambers for the remainder of the day and night. He would step out on the balcony, overlooking the dark and poor city. He remember it being so beautiful, but things happen. He hoped that maybe the upcoming events would brighten it back up.
