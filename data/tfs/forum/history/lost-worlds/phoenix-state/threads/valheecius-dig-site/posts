The trench quickly became rather deep: even the taller members of the party would soon be unable to see over the buttressed walls of the trench. \"Welcome to our dig site. As you can see, the workers have been busy. Or rather,  were busy.  Their digging has been cut short by a discovery, the very one which warranted us taking on your contract.\"The magus would lead from the front, though observant people would notice his hand never strayed far from the holster he carried his blasting rod in. The path he took seemed random: they took left turns, and right turns, sometimes descending deeper into the ground before rising up back to the level they started at. Looking at the walls, one would notice the marks of shovels, as well as the occasional imprint of an artifact which had been removed. In the shade of the trench it was cooler than on the desert floor, though not by much. Eventually Hirhan would signal everyone to stop.\"Here we are, the top of the outer wall.\"The dirt and clay of the walls and floor had given way to carved stone: the wall of an emplacement. The stone was cut into even, squared rectangles, and was utterly black, devoid of any shine or color. It was clearly not like the sandstone present in the local geography. It was volcanic. Strangest of all was were the burn marks. While most of the wall was orderly and straight like tile, in others it looked like melted chocolate. At places it would appear as if the wall had melted, liquid stone forming strange, curvaceous patterns in places, and inverted bubble-like holes in others. At the end of the trench was a breach in the floor: a jagged splinter crack wide enough to accommodate a large man, though it would take a squeeze. Peering through the hole, one would see little more than darkness and the faint outline of a sand covered floor.   \"After the first worker went missing my colleagues decided to ward this crack tighter than the drawstring of a merchant's coinpurse. Only my colleagues or I can dispel this barrier... unless it is blocking something more powerful than all of us combined. But if that was the case we would be utterly screwed anyway, so no sense worrying! Now that I have shown you around, perhaps you would like to prepare a bit before checking the place out. Ralf, I notice your armor is missing, for instance. Of course, it would likely be wise to rest a bit from your travels a bit, maybe eat something. Up to you all, frankly. I'm not paying you by the hour, after all.\"Despite his smile the man was clearly grasping the handle on his blasting rod tightly. Faintly the smell of \"the first worker\" could be smelt in the air.

Evidently whomever had built the fort had equipped it with a remarkably powerful magical shield to protect the central courtyard from above. If there had been shields elsewhere they had been long since destroyed: the burial of the fort's outer walls was testament to that. The seal wasn't perfect, however.

The acid in the thing's mouth would splash about as it charged, leaving a wash of flesh-eating fluids in the daemon's wake.

In its place stood a naked drow woman, standing a good 30 feet tall, with a massive shell of spiked ice on her back.  She grinned and put her hands on her hips, oblivious to her nudity.\"And THAT is how an adventurer does it!\"  She cheered in a loud voice.  She looked around at the people below before realizing she was without her clothes.  She began to blush.\"...well, you don't have to look.....\"  She said sheepishly as she tried to cover up.  Almost immediately after it seemed Wendy continued to grow, the ice on her back melted back into its normal water tendrils as Wendy took up more and more room.\"CrapcrapcracpcrapCRAPCRAPCRAP!\"  She said as she was forced to her knees and was eventually squished into a space far too small for her.  At her massive height, she was stuck on her stomach.  Everyone and everything around her was pushed back towards the sides of the room, leaving only a little for everyone to move.\"....Icanfixthis.\"  She said quickly as she looked at the tiny fighters around her (or as best as she could with her limited movement).", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The demon's bombardment of attacks would cease to end on the fighters as they attempted to tear it to pieces, but to no avail.

The psychic daemon fared far worse. The rapid expansion of the naked drow woman from within it caused the thing's guts to explode out, showering the environs in a slick layer of gore. Wendy would swipe at the acid belcher with a spout of water, pushing the daemon into a corner and up the wall a few feet. With a disgusting squishing sound it would slide down the wall, collapsing into a heap on the floor. The room was silent for a moment. Then came the applause. A lone humanoid figure entered to courtyard, his flesh-less palms making a dull clicking sound as they resounded against one another. The skeleton glimmered in the light, his bones sheathed in a coating of lustrous mithral overlaid with electrum. Etchings reminiscent of circuitry glowed orange in the fading light of the artificial sunlight above, pulsing rhythmically like a heartbeat. It wore a robe made of scales of a dull grey metal which in turn glowed with runes similar to those on the being's extremities. One of it's eye sockets was empty, but the other... a gemstone glowed in the socket, aflame with eldritch power. The being gestured to the party's flanks. Shambling through opening in the walls came the remainder of the daemons Hirhan had seen. The bottom half of the creatures were regular human legs, while everything above the torso was replaced by a mass of bladed limbs and grasping, clawed hands on muscular arms. The being spoke, peering at Raena with his baleful eye.\"I thought I had sensed an ancient enemy. Well met,  Knight.  It has been so long since I have tasted the sweet fear of a full Knight of the Order of the Hammer.\"The creature hissed, it's jaw moving into what must have been a smile. \"I must thank the human wizard though. To bring his companions here, to this place. Easy prey, weak minds. I'm afraid you all have unleashed something unseen in millennia. Oops.\"As he spoke his last word each of the party would feel a pinch of pain on their foreheads. Their protective circlets would fall off one by one, broken by the lich's magics. A long staff of polished electrum would appear in the being's hands, the head of the implement soon glowing orange with arcane power. As one the daemons would lurch toward the party, their movements identical as they sprinted toward the adventurers gathered in the center of the room.

Already he wordlessly channeled his powers, to shield the minds of his companions.

One by one each of the group would feel a presence gently enter their minds. \"Be not afraid, it is me.\" He intoned wordlessly through their mental link.

Her quick needle-like blows would do little to kill the daemons...though her thrusts to the daemon's eyes certainly diminished their effectiveness. Her initial blow would cut through one of the daemon's arms, but little else. She would need more mass or much more speed to properly cut the armored daemons with her sabre. Ralf would find the heavy sweeps of his larger blade far more effective. The daemons would close on him, their multiple limbs snapping out at the warrior.

The Void had made it clear that the woman was theirs. The walls were alive, and the floor soon would be as well.

The smell of ozone and sulfur was pungent in the air, punctuated by the shrill screams of dying daemons and the ring of bare steel. Above the cacophony rang the arcane language of the void. From Raena's mouth a torrent of  nothingness  flowed, the spray licking at the lich's heels. The skeletal enemy had sprung up onto the side of the column, so Raena's attack could only hope to hit his lower half. The terrible essence tore at the being's warded legs, his mitheral-encrusted bones and robe forming a barrier which flared into a mesh of glowing orange hexagons as the void attempted to pierce the wards. Raena had a choice to make: she could continue her attack until the ancient wards collapsed, or she could recall the void, saving herself the agony which tore at her psyche. Only the healing magic of her companion Wendy saved her from total burnout... at least for now. Across the floor Ralf and Rani tore at the Daemonic horde with steel and lightning. Compared to their earlier foes these daemons were weak.. but the numbers...From the wall the twin corpses of the two larger daemons had fully fused. The cannon-like maw of the creature hissed before it expelled a projectile the length of a human arm directly at Ralf. The single jagged tooth trailed acid as it barreled at the warrior with the speed of a ballista bolt. Through the haze of pain the magus Hirhan surveyed the battlefield. Raena's dual with the lich was hopeless. Alone the woman couldn't hope to take the ancient being... not that she was alone. But would the void be enough? With his left hand he reached to his right sleeve, pulling the frayed and bloodied fabric back to reveal his right vambrace. He had enough energy for one more spell, then he would be out cold again. It was time. No chanting or incantation was necessary, nor a gesture or sigil. He had labored long and hard on this spell earlier, sealing the magic away into his gauntlet for this very moment. With a thought the spell broke out of it's gemstone seal. Light flashed about as the wizard's eyes turned the deepest of golds. The light flew in all directions, out to the walls. A binding spell. The daemon was his to control now, if he could hold on and his golden wards held. He collapsed to the floor again, straining against the daemon. It would be his. Meanwhile back in camp Hadrian would find himself suspended in the air by the outskirts of the base camp. Gravity would take it's toll, leaving the mage in a heap on the side of a dune. The air is dry and cool, the moon casting it's glow over the expanse of the desert. Before him is a collection of white canvas tents. Lantern lights glow merrily within, and chatter can be heard between the camp's occupants. They sound happy, and cheerful. For now. A scream would shatter the peace.Robert Fletcher would be enjoying another bottle of wine when a tussle would be heard outside his door, followed by a single scream that would pierce the pleasant hubbub of the camp.

Replacing the creature's upper half is a mass of limbs topped with clawed hands, scythed blades, and gripping talons.
