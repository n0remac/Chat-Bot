Perhaps she's just good at hiding her discomfort. Despite the extended period of time Wendy's spent with Raena, very little about the armoured woman's history has been revealed, and Raena, while apparently having taken a liking to the woman, has still not displayed any sort of true warmth since they departed Aaedan.

She's cut the sleeves off her linen shirt and bleached it white, so as to reflect more of the light, revealing her incredibly toned arms, more powerful than was seen beneath her armour. Her trousers are baggy and breathable, although their dark hue makes them much hotter than Raena would like. She wears no shoes, preferring to go barefoot when out of her armour.
