Any beings entering these lands will be met with force from the tribes living here.The lands are filled with hot sands, sharp rocks, plataeus, trenches and valleys, tar pits, and pools of boiling water that could peel the hide off of a bear. It is trecherous. There are dragons and basilisks. There are wolves and hyeenas. Giant scorpions and tarantulas call the flatter, sandier places, home. The tribes are found in various areas, usually hidden deep within the most dangerous areas. The dangers of these lands go on and on, having more dangerous creatures than most any land. The life that calls this home is primarily hunters who rely on hunting other hunters for food.\u00a0The air is thin and filled with a light case of carbon monoxide, which if not filtered by the effects of the Boha-mata leaf found in the tar pits, will kill you if the life does not.

At this point, the Dark Elves have captured the Chieftain of the Night Elf tribe known as the Black Lion. With this, the Dark Elves turned on the Night Elves and assumed control.

All this because one little girl escaped them with something they wanted so they could use it's power to take on the world and try to cover it in darkness.\"I was wondering why the Royal Forces haven't stopped us yet...There's only one being I know who can create a wildfire and tame it...If so, we will need to prepare for battle here.
