The main port and city are nearly done, but until then, the people have made the best with what they had until the work was done. Life wasn't too bad for those from The Phoenix State, but what locals had joined with them, they were falling to alcohol. They didn't know what to do since they were given everything they wanted. From tribal beliefs to modern society. Still, they were fed, clothed, and sheltered.\u00a0On the water, there were many docks and ships. Some were fishing ships, trade ships, and transport ships, mixed with military ships that were being built as quick as possible. An up and coming spot, but there was more important work at hand that needed to be done before dumping funds into the Port of Ozmodias. The people had built and earned everything going on here.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://monikazawistowska.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/port1_novigrad3_flatten.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://monikazawistowska.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/port1_novigrad3_flatten.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}, "post-10656": {"user": "Dorman Bovar", "user_num": 510, "timestamp": "1442749063000", "message": "The Broadhead sailed into the Port of Ozmidas.  \"A new harbor,\" began Dorman, speaking to Robert Fletcher, \"but a potentially lucrative opportunity.
