It has not been used for many years, but with the reunion of The Phoenix State tribes, it will become a used route due to the safety of it.\u00a0Every tribe has one trade post on this route. Most have been abandoned, but as of recent, vendors have been trying to catch the travelers attention and make some extra money. Who knows, maybe you have interest in some goods or looking to sell one.\u00a0Every so often you will find a squad of three soldiers, generally from the Scout Union. They patrol and do random inspections, as well as keep the monsters in the lands back. As The Phoenix State regains it's statehood, this road will stretch further and increase it's patrol to ensure safe trade and passage.Any interests or reports are to be turned in at Scout Union outposts.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_xjcwwA-nj8k/TBG52xsSnWI/AAAAAAAAAVY/5LyqskT-3ck/s1600/sml.gif"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_xjcwwA-nj8k/TBG52xsSnWI/AAAAAAAAAVY/5LyqskT-3ck/s1600/sml.gif\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/></div>"}}
