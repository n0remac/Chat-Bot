When we do engage anything in combat, we can drop Dak and his men on the ground one mile out. Me and my men will rain hell on them from above, mainly attacking structures such as towers and walls. By time Dak get's there, he should be able to finish the groundwork. Once all visible enemies are taken care of, we all move on foot into the woodlands to push them out.We can leave one ship here, with the allotted men, and they will carry on work. By time we return, they could have it close to done. This is the way I would do this. If they have no walls, we just attack from the ships and move on.\" Rictzin spoke, but willing to hear the other ideas because he had rarely ever been in something like this.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"The map shows sandy with spots of green.
