It is not right to meddle in the affairs of the mortal, Six Faces. You might control me, but one day they will turn on you...You should be grateful we all need them to exist at this moment..\" Amun Ra spoke to the six cloaked beings surrounding him.No movements were made, but something seemed to grasp Amun Ra by his throat. It would squeeze and lift, Amun Ra defenseless to it. He had been stripped down to a demi-god when the Six Faces became the main belief.  And then a voice echoed throughout the chamber, seeming omnipresent, \"Amun Ra, you will do as we say. Do your part and obey or we will feed you to the Nightmare XIII...\"Amun Ra mentally submitted, having no choice but to watch the mortals prepare. He believed that gods shouldn't meddle in the affairs of mortal governments, and to do it was disgusting. Deep inside Amun Ra, his hatred for the Six Faces boiled, but for now, he had to submit and do what he must to survive to protect the mortal world from beings like the Six Faces.\"May the blood bring new life into this world the seeks peace... For I am Amun Ra and I will bless my people...\" Amun Ra whispered to himself, waiting for his next orders.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"I have delivered the message to Promiethius.

With Zaltos being found by Grand General Sinn in the Free City, his faith was powerful, holding 30% of the peoples faith due to his part in their history. This put 40% of the populations faith directly in him. This power was enough to make a surprise attack on the Six Faces.\"Your time draws near, Six Faces...My power is now enough to stand as one of you. You may not be able to kill me, but I can't kill you...This will change soon enough, servants of Evil..\" Amun Ra spoke in an omnipotent, deep voice in the Cathedral, allowing even the guards and creatures to hear his words.And the room would return to normal. The Six Faces in shock as they no longer could bully Amun Ra who silently meditated above the fire. A smile was upon the face of Ra, extending his best will to those who believe in him, his blessing as most call it. When the sun would rise the next morning, it would burn brighter, but the weather would have a fifteen degree cooler temperature across the Valheecius Desert. \"I swear, my people, your worries will soon wash away. Just give me a little more time...\", Amun Ra thought to himself before his meditation turned into a slumber, letting him watch the mortal realm, hoping what he had done doesn't effect the mortal realm in a harsh way.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"THEY HAVE FOUND HIM!\" Amun Ra shouted to the Six Faces."}, "post-6416": {"user": "Grand General Sinn", "user_num": 364, "timestamp": "1439526869000", "message": "Sinn would wake naked and at the feet of the Six Faces and Amun Ra.

His silky black hair fell to his shoulders.He would roar at the Six Faces, his teeth extending forward. He was extremely angered and right now the Basilisk's wrath was fueling his power. Sinn was obviously unhappy to be held there.\"YOU SORRY PIECES OF DRAGON SHIT! I'LL KILL YOU FOR THIS!!\" Sinn shouted at the group.Amun Ra would sit quiet, as Sinn's faith in his was weak. Sinn's faith in any deity or god was weak. The Six Faces imposed their power on him, using his anger against him.\"Sinn, you will do as we say. We will heal all of your scars if you do what we say. What we ask of you are things that are perfect for your skillset. You will join Firgov and Digrazia's force. You will slay all those who deny their will. You will also take some Face Prophets to spread our will. We cannot allow Amun Ra to rule these lands!
