Words were crudely written in stitched on yellow letters to the red fabric. The left banner vertically read: 'HAVE GOLEM', the right: \"WILL TRAVEL\".There were a series of discordant loud BANGS!, followed by some shrill screaming, which startled the animals further and colorful confetti exploded off the now-smoking ramparts and was carried by the wind into the river.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The first thing to alert the guards to something amiss was a strange trembling sensation.

Back at the outpost, Meryn stepped into the outpost, making sure to move quickly so as not to get in the way of the men behind him. Even so, his limbs were old and weary- he was no young man anymore.\"So, you boys want to reissue my ID. Here it is.\"Reaching back into his pocket, Meryn pulled out his fold-out wallet. Carefully removing the faded paper from its slot, he withdrew his old ID- for one Meryn Jorgenson of Vilary. Vilary has been his hometown: a small fishing village in the Great Northern Pass where his family had operated a popular pub, servicing the merchants on their flat-bottomed ships as they sailed down to Hermit's Hill. That name- his given name: was an artifact of Meryn's past. His taken name- Digrazia, his present and future. \"As for my declarations, I am bringing a small, but valuable cargo load with me to Flo'Laire, and the capital if I can't sell it all there. Two bushels of fine Sancturian incense, a crate of silks from Katashima, enough Boha-mata for three men to cross the deserts twice, a fine breastplate of indeterminate origin, a fantastic ceremonial robe, and various pearl and gold jewelry, of origin ranging from Medan to the Solarian Empire. In terms of weapons, I myself will be bringing the crossbow on my back, along with this trusty curved dagger. My men, including Mattium, who is outside, are sellswords. I cannot speak to the quality and origin of their arms and armor, but I know they each have a short spear, a a javelin, a throwing axe, several daggers, a shield and a short sword. You know those mercenary types... thinking they can take on a dragon if only they were heavily armed enough.\"As he spoke he gestured to the crossbow on his back and the dagger on his hip. He was wary of drawing either, let the action be misconstrued as an attack. He finished with a hearty chuckle at his own joke. He was casual and cool, and spoke not a word of a lie. He intended to do everything he had said, and indeed was carrying the very items he had described. What he omitted was his ulterior motives. \"I almost forgot\", he contined, rubbing his temple. \"Outside are three mounts- Brutox, bred by some herder in the wastes east of Ivelius.
