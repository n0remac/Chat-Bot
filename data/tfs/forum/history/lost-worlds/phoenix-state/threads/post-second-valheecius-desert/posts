The horrors and joys of this desert coincide. From gold and love, to greed and despair. This desert is named after the Horseman that was turned on by the other six. It is said that he watches over the desert, looking for his opportunity to come back into the mortal realm. Due to the Pharaohs that have stood over the deserts and ruled in the name of The Phoenix State, they have been protected by the Phoenix from Valheecius. This promoted wealth and power due to their natural resources.The main god worshiped in the Valheecius Desert is Amun-Ra. It has several large cities known as 'Capitols' because they each had their own specialty. Some cities are welcoming, while others will block you out. The Capitol city, Vauc Berhemius, is the main city used for military discussions and political content, such as laws and diplomacy.Capitol Cities:Vauc Berhemius - Law and MilitaryFlo'Liare - Trade and TravelSebuut - Medical Science and Advanced EducationImperial City - Military Training and Basic EducationPhoenix - Religion and Magic ScienceCervinnz - Food and Construction Science\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Libya_4990_Tadrart_Acacus_Luca_Galuzzi_2007.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Libya_4990_Tadrart_Acacus_Luca_Galuzzi_2007.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/>"}, "post-9256": {"user": "Hirhan", "user_num": 469, "timestamp": "1441981398000", "message": "The dig site had built itself organically on the side of the oasis like a growth.
