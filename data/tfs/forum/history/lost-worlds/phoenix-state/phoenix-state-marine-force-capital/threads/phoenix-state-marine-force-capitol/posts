Wearing no excess clothing to keep him warm, and his face open to the frigid air, his breathe was never seemed as he seemed to breathe a cold air. \"It is time... the world will known the barren power of The Phoenix State Marine Force.\" Esphirises spoke calmly to himself before a large smirk covered his blueish-white face. As he neared the gate, he would lift his right hand. With it, the icy stone gate seem to lift open at his will. It was due to his ability to control ice. Unless a being was able to use high magic and lift the gate, normal siege weapons would take weeks to break through. In the center was Drumbar Steel, coated by a concrete like material for the main mass, with a four feet thick layer of ice. Oddly enough, the bridge was clear, but the fortress in the mountain was coated in ice. Upon his entrance, he was greeted by officers. They would salute, take his mount, and continue on. Esphireses checked out the fortress, making sure everything was okay while letting everyone know he was back. His final stop was a small office like room. Esphireses would walk in an place a letter on the desk, surprising the woman at the desk, \"Here are our orders. We're moving west to build a navy. Prepare a couple battalions for departure. We need to be ready, as we will be building, colonizing, and maybe even encounter some enemies. This means we need to get things rolling so that our people are ready to make their new home. Inside the letter is the breakdown of how I want the forces arranged.\"The woman responded, \"Yes, Sir!\", before going to the letter. Inside the following arrangement of soldiers was to be prepared:For the West:Company Aros200 Royal Marines400 Standard Combat Marines15 Siege Weapons2 Desert Ships\u00a0Company Bertham:125 Royal Marines400 Standard Combat Marines10 Siege Weapons2 Desert ShipsCaravan of stoneWith that, Esphireses left the room and went to his quarters at the very top. He would turn to a book of the ancients that was frozen into a stand that illuminated light from within. He looked up through a sky light and then down to the book. He would begin to speak in a Kiraxan tongue, reading the book out loud. As he spoke, the light fell upon the man and his skin glistened like small diamonds. His reading was religious and magical. His vampiric teeth took more effect the more he read. After so long, his skin would shed, falling to ash. Above his room was a structure that looked like it could host some sort of beam. After a few minutes of the reading, that's what it would do. A massive blue beam shot into the sky. It glowed, broadcasting itself for miles. Thankfully, due to location, it was not seen. This beam was thought to be a magical port, that when all Capitol Bases activated theirs, Amun Ra and the Six Faces would return to the mortal realm and lead them to conquer and spread their will. One more of the mysteries of the reuniting of The Phoenix State. What made it believable to Esphireses is that in the many years he had read these scrolls, it happened now, as he was to begin his navy.\"We will free you, Amun Ra to cast your judgement and appoint your new Six Faces...\" He thought to himself in a prayer like notion, looking to the skylight.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "A man garbed in a long blue cloak and mounted on the back of an Archaniox Rhino cam strutting across the bridge.

The large ships were filled with supplies and siege weapons. The Aros Company was in formation and the Bertham was finishing up. A fierce gathering of soldiers, the nightmare of anything they crossed. As the standing company for Esphireses, anything that did not convert would vanish from the face of the Overworld. His religious passion meshing with his military views. \"Aros Company, from this point on, we are the judgement of Amun Ra and the talons of the Phoenix. We will conquer the lands we set foot on. Those who deny our offer of peace and Amun Ra, must perish, or they will bring evil into our new lands. Our mission is to colonize the lands between our land and the ocean to establish a navy. We will march until we reach it safely and know that we can safely begin work. What happens in the next couple weeks, what we do, will remain with us. We will not boast of our deeds, as even Amun Ra cries when he has to judge his children for their evil. If you are afraid that you may not be able to preform the possible tasks ahead, please leave now.\" Esphireses shouted across the large warehouse like room to the standing men while the sand ships remained docked in a hangar on the other side of two large doors. All the men responded with a loud \"A-MUN-RA!\", stomped with their right foot, and pounded the right hand on their breast place. The voices echoed, making it much louder. With that, Esphireses would order the doors to be opened. When the doors opened, the ships were levitating above the ground. The ships would open their sails begin moving slowly out the large opening in the mountain side. Behind them was the soldiers who would march. Their steps would match the sound of the magic field carrying the ships. When the soldiers and ships crossed the bridge, the ships would take their final formation to travel across the desert. Each ship would take a spot on each side of the ground troops. They would act as a scout for them.
