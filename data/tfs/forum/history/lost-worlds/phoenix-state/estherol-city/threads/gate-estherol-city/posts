One is of a human and the other is of an elf. Do not be fooled because there is no visible 'gate' between the two. In a whim, the two statues seem to come to life as a large wall of stone and sand forms. Although not as strong as a reinforced gate, it is strong enough to provide necessary time for Estherol City to arm itself.Estherol City was founded on the Estherol family's mining operations started hundred of years ago. The tribe known as the Red Dove Tribe calls this city home. With only one entrance to the land due to it's expanding mining operations from it's walls creating a large drop unless proper paths are followed.The base population is human and elfin. Their species has formed into a mix of the two due to generations of cross breeding. Their mining operations fuel their medical science program. It is highly recommended for anyone looking to become a medic or doctor of any kind. A very prominent city, but the only time you want to see this place is to buy gold or further your education. If you see this land for any other reason, it's probably because you have a serious health issue.The city produces no military or government itself, as it is only interested in helping the world. If it wasn't for the mines, there would be no military presence at all. Since the mines are a factor, the mine is forced to lease a company of 700 Phoenix State Royal Force foot soldiers and 100 specialty soldiers(1,000npc count), if they want protection. This is done to show everyone that the soldiers are a personal endeavor, not a government endeavor.If you decide to visit, please enjoy the area for it's medical achievements and history. There is good food, medical museums, the Red Dove Tribe, and much more in the main city. If not, with the right permission, one could possibly get to explore the mines and caves of Estherol City.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://img09.deviantart.net/2445/i/2012/109/6/4/desert_kingdom_by_artofjokinen-d4wrlwo.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://img09.deviantart.net/2445/i/2012/109/6/4/desert_kingdom_by_artofjokinen-d4wrlwo.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/>"}, "post-5377": {"user": "Scout Union", "user_num": 431, "timestamp": "1436837948000", "message": "The ground would come to what seemed to be the only way into the land.

It never loses it's beauty, no matter how many time you see it.\" As the group would cross the bridge, the soldiers hidden throughout would watch, but never make a move. This land had an open border policy, so they couldn't legally an outpost here to host a government paid security force. Not only this, but other legal technicalities were in play that prevented armed guards noticeably at the gate. So the group would never notice who or what was watching, or that they were being watched.\"We'll head to the main office of the Estherol Estate. They'll tell us where Firgov is and then we can go home.\" The escorts spoke.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The ground would come to what seemed to be the only way into the land.

Uglu didn't appreciate the arid air of the Phoenix State. But Sangilak's song had calmed him down. That lullaby always seemed to work even though Uglu didn't understand what the words meant.Sangilak was born with congenital endometriosis. It was an extremely painful condition that had eventually rendered her infertile. Though her healing magic and herbs could help deal with the pain, there was no known cure. Healing magic was all about aiding cells grow. It doesn't help when your own cells are hurting you.In a strange way, Uglu was a blessing. The orphan was the closest thing she could ever have to a son, and he too was sick. He suffered from hemolytic anemia. His own immune was attacking his red blood cells. Again, what's the point of magic that boosts one's immune system when that immune system only serves to kill you faster? That said, healing magic, periodically administered, would restore his strength and possibly allow him to live a full life.But Sangilak wanted more for him. He deserved to be able to run around and play without having a cleric constantly keep an eye on him. He deserved a long life, a wife of his own, a real future that he could control. What if something happened to him? What if a cleric wasn't around? What if he was separated from the tribe, left to suffer and die a horrific death.But that would all change, if the Phoenix State could cure him.As one of Zaltos' generals, she expected to be treated well.(OOC: I used this song for inspiration for the poem. It's not much. I wrote it pretty fast. lol )", "link_list": ["https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Jg2D3ve_kg"], "image_list": [], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><i>Fledgling little bird, why are you so sad?<br>Do you feel unworthy of the gift of flight?<br/>Fledgling little bird do not feel so bad.<br/>Everything will be all right.<br/><br/>Fledgling little bird, do not mourn, for them.<br/>Everything in life must return to earth.<br/>Fledgling little bird you may sing, amen.<br/>For their wings are your right of birth.</br></i><br/></div>"}}
