They gathered his clothes and items, carrying them off to a nook on the side. His body was clearly old and slightly wrinkled, but was toned to a degree that it was by no means disgusting to look at. As the women undressed him, Firgov would notice the knot of an arrow wound in the banker's right shoulder, along with a long-since healed burn scar on the outer side of his right arm. Settling into the water, Meryn would let out a slight gasp, the cool water an immediate and refreshing relief from the desert heat. Cupping his hands he would gather water before releasing it over his head, the water dampening his black hair, slicking it back. With his right hand Meryn would adjust his hair, smoothing it out of his eyes. \"You cannot imagine how nice it is to bathe again, after my time on the road.\" Meryn would say as he adjusted his hair. You have my thanks. Swimming a bit closer, within range of conversation, Meryn would stop. The presence of the other men was a bit disheartening: that meant onlookers and listeners. He was glad he had let the attendants remove his heavy gold ring of office, as he wished to keep his presence in The Phoenix State a secret for as long as possible, or at least until necessary. Perhaps he would have to wait to explain his masterstroke until the following morning. Fearing awkwardness, Meryn would wait for Firgov to signal for more conversation. be it through body language or speech. For now he would enjoy himself in this marvelous bathhouse.

If all goes well, I believe they'll march to the borders of Medan and claim the rest of the waterfront. I've sent the M.F. Capitol orders to dispatch an extra two thousand men to follow to the South. I could reroute these orders to send those forces to me, creating a grand total of 4,000 men. I would find this force to be reasonable and sustainable for any dangers in the Orc infested land... When we get there, if we can build the economic chain and control the military, we can control it all without ever being found out. In these lands, my men will march under the Estherol flag. I'll send a message to the Arch General Promiethius to bring himself and his men that he has with him. He will be my puppet, as we are very well acquainted. I believe we can complete any goal at hand without being in the spotlight. We will be supply carriage riders on this trip... There should be plenty of supplies there to build with and repair structures. We'll need to establish a city there before any others so that we can guarantee our final goal...

Both men swam in the shallow end of the pool, so it was possible for them to stand rather than tread water. \"The specifics can wait for tomorrow, but I intend to \"buy you out\", at least by official market metrics once you gain exclusive minting rights for the region. What you actually do with the bank is up to you, I am only concerned with how the stockholders and politicians perceive the merger. Yes you heard me correctly. Where two banks stood, one will remain. One with the combined power to completely dominate the world's economy, with the power to shape politics for centuries, to mobilize armies and start wars. You, of course, would be compensated generously... part of my payment would be in the form of Bank shares, enough to propel you deep into the Imperial Bank's inner council of shareholders. I could even give you the sole rights to the administration of The Phoenix State's currency, if that would allay your concerns.\"Smiling, Meryn would look the man right in the eyes. If he showed indecision, he was certain Firgov would be able to detect it. \"My intention is not to rob you of your power, but are rather purely pragmatic and benevolent.

This would go for four years. On the first day of the fifth year, we will have this same discussion. With a total of five thousand and a strong supply line, we could have a successful march all the way to Solaria. I want the power... you want the money... We could craft this dividing land into pure profit. If we can go from sea to sea, ALL trade will pass through the land, which means a profit off of every foreign person or object wanting to pass or trade. If the bank controls the government openly here, greed will set in on the others. If we can get Solaria to work right... the Great Cataclysm will be a joke to those trapped between the great nations of Fire. North, Middle East, and the South, the nations of fire will control. Currently, they are enemies, but the full control of the Middle East would add fuel to our fire... I can keep it rolling with a campaign, and you can budget it. To be honest, this is a 50/50 deal.

He wouldn't sell out, but he was will to do a 50/50 union. A campaign to conquer a fair amount of land to control while others could economically benefit off of it. He offered full control of economics while he assumed full control of the land and military. It would tie them together, leaving neither one of them capable of screwing each other. The bank would need an economy to fuel while the military and land would need a bank to sustain it's economy. \"Our secrecy will last for awhile, as Promiethius will act as my lead. Eventually, if Solaria is taken care of, I will reveal myself. At that point, the lands in between will be healthy enough to deem a state or nation... I say we create a flag and a name to start this campaign. It will help hide our identity as we cross the lands.I think full secrecy of our identity is key until we are established. What could The Phoenix State and Ivelius do, drop their gold suppliers and crash? We already have control, but it is limited. With a bank in the middle, they could trade with directly trading with each other. Both of them knows this would be great for them.

You seem to have misjudged me, at least to a certain degree. My desire for wealth is in itself another avenue for the pursuit of power. I am no megalomaniac, I simply wish for my will to be done, for my vision of the future to come to fruition. Wealth is a vehicle, as are you, our banks, and the nations we represent. If all I desired was wealth, I would have expanded my operations at home, or something of the like. I do not desire money, but rather control over the money supply.\"Meryn breathed in deeply. It was growing dark outside and torches had been lit along the walls of the room. Meryn's golden eyes appraised Firgov. \"War looms on the horizon, a war between our nations. The wrong nations. To avert the coming crisis and redirect the warhawks, pressure will have to be applied down onto the governors and the military commanders. I see little room for profit in a war between Ivelius and The Phoenix state... though it must be noted that warhawks rarely think in terms of profits and losses in the same way we do. All I ask is for a nominal majority share. 51%, if you currently hold 100% of your bank's shares, or 1% over whatever you are holding if you do not hold the full share. In exchange you will be granted that which you already have, namely authority as regional director to oversee and dictate all activities of our merged bank in the Phoenix State... along with what was once most of the Sancturian Church's share of the Imperial Bank. You would be the first non-native councilmember, and the one with the fifth largest share of the twenty-four. If my calculations are correct, based on the current valuations of both of our enterprises that deal would be an undervaluation of about 14% on my end, not that I particularly mind.\" Echoing Firgov's earlier smile, Meryn returned a good-natured grin. \"I would loathe to draw out negotiations with penny-grubbing bargaining. I seek equal partnership, each contributing in their own way. As for your military plans, I currently don't field more than a nominal force to my own name, along with the more sizable but currently preoccupied Garrison of The Imperial Bank in Lorikar. I do have my own finances, however. I could scrounge up some mercenary forces if needed, saboteurs and the like. I figure these would augment your more traditional forces well. I will leave the governance of whatever we conquer to you alone, consider my ongoing support an offering of goodwill in acknowledgement of your contributions on the other side of our deal. \"Finally, and perhaps most importantly, I offer my experience to our joint venture. I have governed the economy of Ivelius for almost twenty years, and worked through it for far longer. I have studied the economies of the rest of the world from afar, and exploited that knowledge to create the most sophisticated banking system seen since the First Age. I offer my tutelage, and my friendship. I reckon my life is nearing it's close, and the only heir I left was...\"  Meryn's face suddenly dropped, appearing utterly depressed and sombre.

He'd then walk out of the pool up set of stairs. He'd grab a loin cloth and put it on. He would air dry himself and use a small towel to dry his hair.

The water had done wonders for his muscles, but nevertheless his muscles ached terribly. Seizing his towel he dried his body, taking special care with his hair. Leaving the loincloth unattended, he would instead wrap the towel around his waist, tucking the loose end in at the side. Glancing over at the nook he had left his possessions in, he noted it had been emptied by an attendant.
