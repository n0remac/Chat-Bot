On the visible side, was a triangle with a circle within it. Within the circle was the eye of Ra.A light indentation of fire was placed as the background for the Eye of God with the Eye of Ra within it. On the larger gold coin, the mark of the Kiraxo. In the background is a Phoenix. On the smaller gold coin, we have the Firgov emblem. On the large silver piece, we put The Phoenix State emblem in raised print. On the smaller silver, we have the mighty dragon of legend, Vauc Berheemius. And on the brass coin, we have the ancient cuneiform for the word 'Give'. We want people to remember to give to those who need it, no matter what it is.If you look at the bottom of each coin, there is a smaller printed set of words. They all say the same, just different script from different tribes. All say 'Freedom. Prosperity. Education. Health', the promise of The Phoenix State. These were the coins for the entire State. The only ones that exist at this point.\"When he thought of the Serpent on the coins and thought of his coins backside, he'd laugh. He picked a symbol that was religious and well demonstrated. The backside was a Phoenix with the Eye of Ra as it's visible right eye. With it's wings at full spread, it's talons were fully clenched around a serpent. In their ancient cuneiform, a language known by very few, would be printed 'Unite. Believe. Conquer. Destroy.' All which he would not reveal the cuneiform meaning to Meryn when he flipped them over.\"We have basic minting for the higher class. Very few even have markings, finding it a waste of coinage to fancy a piece of gold. It has been a long time since i've touched this topic, but minting is something I have tried to convince the governing body to allow. Each time they say no because it is wasteful and they don't want their coins to be the desire of greed. Lately rumors were heard that the Gold Bear Tribe has begun their own mint, but like me, they can do as they please because they are needed... It's something i've wanted to do. More jobs, more gold to be used, as well as stabilizing the economy.Medan is a good trade partner, as well as many nearby lands. We import way more than we export, trying to rid of more. I just want somewhere or something to dump this in. Governments, purchasing land, becoming a foreign loan distributor, I don't really care. You know where these precious metals can go to get rid of it. If you can help me find a few places to build a hospital or medical camp, we can do that. If such a thing could happen, Estherol Mining will pay for all travels, housing, education, and food, for whoever wants to work there. We do not practice shaman magic, we practice the science, and we find that it works. I've got a few more ideas, a little more interesting, but they'd be good for you and I. I just need my gold in your land. It's a wise investment for any business man. We know our markets and surrounding markets, but we need a whole new market. I'd back the bank with my gold, all i'd want is citizenship and the ability to purchase land. If I remember right, the Sanctuarians were very well off and Ivelius was doing good. There's a lot of land in between, and the market is open on it.

His original mission here to the desert was to quell the looming threat of The Phoenix State against Ivelus. What was needed was shared institutions, or at least one capable of forcing both to begrudgingly allow the other to live, out of fear of mutually assured destruction. The Solarian gold could easily be cast into diluted, counterfeit currencies of either nation, a de-facto kill switch on any economy The Imperial Bank wished to destroy.

This mine has been in the family for generations. At one time, these mines were done by pick and hand, mining only what was needed. Getting to the place I am now, on a larger scale, is much more interesting. So i'll just give you the spill of my history.Born in the Red Dove Tribe, a tribe devoted to medical science, I had a very healthy start. At that point,  The Phoenix State had a much stronger grasp on the mine, holding a loan on the mine. Up to the age of four, I had a great life. When I reached the age of four, I was pulled from my home, and sent to begin my education and training. The school they sent me to was unbearable, always pushing me to my limits. It tempted death every day...The Marine Force Military Academy, the roughest military academy, generally used for the more aggressive  youth. I was not aggressive, I was quiet and timid, something that was changed quickly. I used my calmness and understanding against them. I watched the soldiers, I embraced my math and science education, everything I seen and felt, I remember. As a child, I was angered by this, thinking I was being punished. When I reached the age of fourteen and I was sent to the Marine Force Training Corps, where they take the lethal weapons the Academy produced by physically training us during our young ages, and craft it into a well formed man. It was not as brutal as my younger years.Another benefit to reaching the Training Corps, I met my brother. Esphireses Estherol, a Six Wing Phirum over the Training Corps. He showed no favoritism in work loads and training, but he did make sure I had the best educators, who seemed to be harsher than some. I never made it to his rank, but I did graduate with a good rank. My brother went on to become the Arch Admiral of The Phoenix State Marine Force. We keep in touch, and I fund his campaigns. In turn, my mining technology has grown, as well as the medical sciences. To be honest, I may only be allowed so many soldiers here, but in truth, I own the most useful branch of the military. All by the age of twenty three.Eventually over the years, I struck a deal with the Red Dove Tribe and they migrated to our land, forming Estherol City. Shortly after this, refugees of war were coming to our city, and The Phoenix State needed our medical facilities and staff. These were dark times for everyone, no amount of gold or soldiers could guarantee safety.\" Firgov spoke, taking a short pause as his mind flipped through images of the war of the Great Cataclysm. His eyes would move to look at his hands. Thousands of faces flooded his mind, remember the look on every face that he killed. His mind was divided, knowing he had to do what he did for survival, but feeling guilty for having to do it. No man was too strong to feel sadness for the death of another, always wishing they didn't have to do it.\"After many years of this dark age, The Phoenix State still stood, but was very weak. If it was not for their drive to fulfill their promise, they would have fell. Their faith carried them to where we stand now. Times have been peaceful ever since. Mining operations have increased, people have been healthy, and our freedom has been safe. In the last few years, evil has began to spread across the lands, hurting trade routes here and there, like what happened with route to Ivelius.Recently, talks of war have spread. Before this was talks of colonization, growing our borders. I think it's a good idea to colonize abandoned lands. I believe as long as the government gets what it wants, there will be no war. If for some reason there is no option of even peace, they will ensure the borders are safe... So this is what my life has been. An upbringing of pain, humility, and sadness, that all lead to a life of strength, wisdom, prosperity, and joy.\" Firgov spoke, leaving out a few details that he wanted to keep secret.\"Now you.

I was the youngest, something of a runt. We lived just outside the border of Ivelius, in a small fishing village nestled on a river side in the Great Northern Pass. I spent my youth watching the traders who passed through the village on their flat-bottomed boats as they sailed in and out of the Empire. It fascinated me, the freedom of the travelers, their wanderlust... and their cunning. I envisioned myself some great explorer, off to explore and travel the world.\"Meryn laughed then, taking a deep sip of Ta. \"My brothers, save one, all joined the army. At that time, anyone who entered the legions earned themselves Sancturian citizenship after two years of service. My brothers were enamored by the empire, and so they went to war. One came back. And so I joined, my heart filled with rage and vengeance. I guess we were both military men, at one point. It wasn't the place for me: the ordering, pompous nobles leading their charges into the meat-grinder for hopeless chances of glorious victory. When it was all over I left as soon as I could, using my wages to buy a boat and some wares to take up the river. My business expanded: from me and my boat to multiple ships, employees, shops and mines. I went from a serf to a magnate, and boy did that piss THEM off.\" Meryn smiled a bit, suppressing the faintest of giggles.\"And so I sought a noble title.
