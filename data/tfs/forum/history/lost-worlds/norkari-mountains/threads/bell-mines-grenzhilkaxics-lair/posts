The victim of a giant avalanche, the mine had been buried along with many of its workers and various soldiers that had been in conflict just before the crushing snow fell. In those days, he had made work of clearing away the entrance to the mines, and the debris that surrounded it.Nestled in the folds of a rocky valley, the natural defenses of high walls of stone and ice were already present. A thick layer of ice now also covered the ground for hundreds of feet into the valley, making approach by the unprepared difficult and slow. The outer stonework of the mine's entrance had too been so encased, leaving only the portcullissed entrance free of the clinging crystals.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/sifAqTk.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"Entrance to Grenzhilkaxic's Lair\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/sifAqTk.jpg\" style=\"width:90%;\"/></div>"}}
