He was dressed in a simple robe of no disguisable recognition, style or fashion-trend. Everything in his office was neat, organized and clean. In front of his was a trade agreement between two merchant families who had sought his assistance in settling a sales dispute of some minor goods of imported wood. One claimed that he had a higher right to buy the goods from the merchant captain, while the other arrived to the port first. A really insignificant dispute that would not affect the city as a whole in any meaningful way\u2026 The fall of Oramaj has hit hard, it would seem. \u201cGive the rights to whomever wins in a duel of wits. Whoever is quicker with the tongue is better suited to gain better wages from the wood sales\u2026\u201d Yisrel quipped. The ethereal Djinn was always present. A terrible price for a Djinn to pay, as he had fallen even further in the scales of power from the centuries of constant advisory role he imposed upon the Heads of Oramaj. \u201cI was thinking about giving it to the Merchant who got there first. He seemed to have the wisdom to be there on time.\u201d Abdul replied, moving his left hand to pick up the letter in front of him, raising it up and holding it higher for him to see. Not that it helped him solve the problem any quicker, but the motion made him feel like he was making progress in the matter.\u201cHmmm.. But his family is of a lower standing. Giving it to him would signal other Merchants to delegate their\u2026 \u2018Issues\u2019 to you in attempt to gain favour in the Court.\u201d The Djinn answered. \u201cThat has crossed my mind, yes. But it would serve Sakand better in the long term if the better suited family raises to power. And gaining popular support within the rising stars of the Merchants caste will contribute to us raising in favor as well.\u201d Abdul replied, his right hand moving towards his chin and taking on a more thoughtful pose. Hm, the stubbles have appeared again. How long has it been since I shaved?\u201d\u201cSpeaking of the rising stars\u2026\u201d Yisrel said before disappearing. Not that he was physically manifested next to Abdul, Yisrel\u2019s presence was only felt within Abdul\u2019s mind. A constant companion within his mind, whether he enjoyed the fact, or didn\u2019t. Abdul had already raised his gaze from the paper up to the single-door frame when it was opened. A singular, petite frame entered the room. Dark skin, black hair with observant, \u2018powerful\u2019 eyes. Mute instinctively scanned the room in a mere second, the motion only visible to Abdul\u2019s similarly powerful gaze. I choose well, it would seem\u00a0Abdul thought.Following Mute into the room was, of course, the \u2018Rising Star\u2019 herself. Miroell\u2019s unique frame was in many ways an immense disappointment. While early in her Courtly career, her appearance had attracted many suitors to her, despite the hints of mingled bloodline. However, the fumbling mind, and near comical displays of immature behavior Miroell constantly displayed was an immense\u2026 Difficulty. He would never state so out loud, but he was at first quite pleased with the challenge it gave him. But now, as with everything else, the repetitiveness was simply that. Repetitive. Mute opened the door wide for Miroell, the door frame had long since been widened to allow Miroell to enter unopposed, has had many other doors that were in her general pathway. A subtle sign of where she was allowed. As had happened many times before, and as he calculated, will happen many times again, Miroell positioned herself at the center of the room-wide carpet, took in a deep breath, and prepared herself.\u201cCongratulation, Miroell.\u201d Abdul started. \u201cYou have, once again, brought disfavor upon her house. I would say that you\u2019ve once again topped your previous display, given that you managed to chase away the Emira\u2019s niece, but I would be lying to both of us.\u201d There was no anger. No signs of disappointment. No sadness, no frustration. No curious tone, no\u2026 Nothing. There were no emotions in his voice. None to be found. After years of this, they had simply\u2026 Left him. It was always the same tone. -That- tone. The tone that was ever only used on Miroell. And it was -That- tone that hurt Miroell the most. Abdul didn\u2019t care. Miroell thought he never noticed, and Mute shuffled uncomfortably next to the door as she closed it. \u201cI-I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d Miroell said, her uncontrollable emotions appearing once again in her eyes, her shattered voice and submissive behavior. \u201cDon\u2019t bother. You know as well as I do, that you will repeat this scandal once more at the earliest opportunity you are given. It is what you do, and what I must do in return in to scold you.\u201d Abdul said, his gaze looking away from the rather boring subject at this point  and back to the disagreement still held up with his right hand. Miroell\u2019s eyes swelled up into tears as she stared at her father, taking a step out of the circle in the carpet as she sought to display her will and release the powerful feeling in her heart. \u201cN-no I won\u2019t! I promise I won\u2019t do it again! P-please, believe me\u2026\u201d The only reply Miroell got was a cold stare.Unable to feel herself as she thought she lost even more of her father\u2019s love to her, she silenced her cry for forgiveness, closed her eyes, and moved back into her circle. That cold gaze was the only thing required to break Miroell once again, has it had done so in the past, and Abdul calculated it would do so again. During an extended period of overwhelming silence, Abdul spoke up again. \u201cOnce again, you have shown yourself unable to handle the realities of this world. You are, and continue to be, a disappointment. A failure. A disgrace to this family\u2026 And me.\u201d Abdul said towards Miroell, his voice still refraining from showing any emotional attachments. It was still the same, repeating course. Remember the Contract Abdul heard within his mind. A trick that Yisrel had displayed quite early in their union. It always sounded and felt as if he were speaking to himself, yet there was always that presence that he felt disappearing after such communion. One of the rare games he had still left to play.\u201cBut, you continue to retain my blood within you. I have, as always, managed to bail you out of punishment of public indecencies, display of sexual affection to the Emira\u2019s family, vandalism of trade goods, and more minor crimes listed against you. You will be put under house arrest until this has blown over. A Sabeena Taliph is waiting inside your room, and will listen to yourself cry your heart out. You\u2019re dismissed.\u201d Abdul said, the first sign of emotion manifesting in him as he let out a soft sigh, his gaze once again going back to the dispute paper.Mute proceeded to take the hint, and quickly moved to open the door for Miroell. As usual, Miroell stood before him, frozen with her emotions, unable to move and looking destroyed by the uninterest of her father\u2019s voice\u2026 Something changed.Abdul\u2019s eyes were near-instantly attracted away from the paper, purposefully seeking out the subject of change, his instincts never betrayed him before, and for once, it felt like they did as his gaze fell on\u2026 Miroell? This is new.Miroell looked up from her submissive stance, and looked Abdul straight into the eyes. Of course, Abdul challenged the stare with his own, but Miroell did not back down. This -is- new. \u201cI want to change.\u201d Miroell said. A fire. A miniscule, metaphorical fire was in her voice as she uttered those four words. \u201cYou do\u2026?\u201d Abdul answered, his voice was cold now. The razor sharp edges of his reply could be felt with every vowel he uttered. \u201cAnd how do you propose you\u2026 Change?\u201dMiroell flinched. Not unexpected, has Miroell was not famed for her forward planning. She seemed lost, confused. Caught off-guard. The tiger cub was standing before the aged Tiger of Oramaj, its interested.. Pitiqued. Miroell never lost the fire, however.\u201cI-... I don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t. But I want to changed. I want to help, father. I don\u2019t want to lose you like I lost mom\u2026 Please, help me change.\u201d There was pleading in Miroell\u2019s voice. A deal? Abdul thought. \u201cWhat do I get in exchange?\u201d After a moment of silence. A long moment of silence, Miroell replied.\u201c... A daughter you\u2019re proud of.\u201d", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Abdul sat in front of his desk in a quiet, dignified manner.

She wasn\u2019t really reading the words, as much as just trying to assign things to them. The curves, strange shapes and lines drawn in the center of things all mixed together into an undecryptable jumble of\u2026 Ink. It wasn\u2019t as if she wasn\u2019t trying. She had to learn in order to protect Miroell better than she currently could. It was simply that she had no one to help assign objects to these icons. Why is this shape that, but not this shape? Who decided on this? Why? Internal theoretical and philosophical debates were what she was denounced into every time she attempted to self-learn.A drawn out moan. Mute perked her ears as she heard Miroell\u2019s lungs being emptied against her will. The Sabina Taliph currently attending to Miroell\u2019s overabundance of emotions was doing quite well at\u2026 Calming\u2026 Miroell down. Mute had learned the hard way on how important these meetings were to Miroell, and after watching one such meeting in a brief moment, she had entirely opted to stay out of it from then on. She didn\u2019t go too far away, though. Miroell was quite important. More important than Mute would reveal. Her eyes always revealed the \u2018Truth\u2019, and the truth was never simple. Still, Mute couldn\u2019t complain. She liked it here, despite the proximity Miroell would grand to people Mute didn\u2019t trust. She was an entire mystery and a muse in her own rights. An unknown, despite having watched her for months now. The 'Truth' was complex around Miroell.\u00a0A pinch of emotions flare within Mute\u2019s stomach as she thought of Miroell, unfamiliar emotions that she could not assign objects to. She could not voice them, give them meaning, or even understand them. She knew it wasn\u2019t hate. She had felt hate, felt it teach her to drink, to eat and to breath. Hate was simple. This\u2026 Wasn\u2019t. Footsteps.Mute used her powers to appear right around the corner, her left hand on the hilt of the saber on her back, ready to pull out, steeling herself for fierce combat in the tight corridors. A yelp of surprise.It was the Oramaj servant boy.Mute eased down while the servant boy lost his balance and fell down on his rear. Mute took up a more eased position as she simply observed the child in front of her. He always looked uncomfortable around her, the initial fear he showed had been replaced with a strange, unidentifiable stance. A stance she could mimic, and did. She didn\u2019t know what this quirk represented, but it seemed to put him more at ease around her. A weakness she could exploit should he prove traitorous. \u201cS-sorry, Miss. Y-you scared me. Again.\u201d The boy said sheepishly, a blush coloring his cheeks, Mute\u2019s adaptation caused her to blush as well, which seemed to further encourage trust and relaxation from him. Why?\u201cThe Master told me to deliver this letter to you. Said you were to deliver it to the, uhm\u2026 \u2018Recent Disaster\u2019. I assume you know who he means. He also told me that Lady Miroell would be under further attention until you return.\u201d, the Ideas planted within the boys mind seemed to make him blush even further, Miroell\u2019s \u2018legendary\u2019 lung capacity had made her rather renowned within the House. Not that it helped make Mute\u2019s job easier.Mute simply nodded towards the messenger boy, and held out his hand. He blinked slightly at the posture, before realising his mistake and offered Mute the letter held in his right hand. Mute accepted the letter without comment, placing it safely beneath her shawl, and looked at the Boy. The boy, to his credit, quickly realizing what that look meant, and quickly made his way away. Another, more muffled gasp coming from MIroell\u2019s locked room to entice his imagination as he left. Mute looked after him leave from around the corner, waiting until he had vanished from her view until she turned around and approached the door. She knocked twice. Waited. And then once. A signal to Miroell, assuming she heard it. Miroell confirmed it as she called out in a far, far  too sultry tone. \u201cBe safe~\u201d The voice caused a shiver to travel down Mute\u2019s spine, a strange bodily reaction she despised. The confusion. The inability to identify. The\u2026 Unknown. She needed to know but she could ask no one.With that, she left the house through the front entrance, and made her way to the Grand Palace.
