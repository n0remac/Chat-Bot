Young men, their heads half shaved and a symbol tattooed into the side, knelt by their feet, a bowl in one hand and a good threaded towel in the other.Sashriq lifted first one foot for the young man to take off his sandal, and then the other, and kept his robes clutched in his hands as the attendant washed his feet. It was obvious that Ryden was expected to the same, but perhaps would be awkward and require another attendant given the boots he wore.The ambassador spoke. \"Lady Fairuz waits on the Kalim laKaia, the Hummingbird pavilion,\" he said, his gaze steady on Ryden. \"You may take one attendant with you, but no more. I will escort you up the stairs once you are ready.\"And from where they stood they could see that these particular stairs were made of... gold. Beautiful ruins with other designs were inlaid upon them, and seemed as if they might have served another purpose, once upon a time.The Shari'la ab-Danahi was a very tall building with many floors. Every 30 feet or so, stood a guard on each side of the stairwell, outfited and base to be like a statue on their small pavilions. It became obvious that this entrance was for people of note, and once the attendants were done washing the feet of Ryden, his chosen clerk, the ambassador, and his chosen clerk, two more attendants came, balancing large umbrellas to shade Ryden and Sashriq.Sashriq gestured for Ryden to start up the steps first, and after a good climb, in which Ryden would see the beautiful gardens that draped and blossomed and thrived, along with works of art and literal bejeweled hummingbirds darting about, they would finally come to a round pavilion that was entirely surrounded in a shallow fountain ring, spouts every few feet.The tiles in the fountain seemed to make it sparkle an assortment of colors, and thick columns were outside even that, climbing with vines that dripped with an explosion of colorful, sweet flowers, making a thick canopy overhead. In the center of the large fountain ring, a created island, was a gauzy netting that somewhat obscured the view inside... where a dark haired woman obviously lounged on a mound of pillows. It seemed as if she might be, perhaps reading?Guards were close, but not close enough to inhibit the beauty of the setting, and a white draped servant girl was seen leaving the island through the shallow water, having just delivered something into the sheer tent. Perhaps food?The guards at the top of the steps stopped them from going forward, which Sashriq had expected. \"Chancellor Ryden Greyiron is here, my lady.\"\"Good,\" answered the obscure woman from inside the tent, her voice young and not as heavily accented as Sashriq's. \"You may go, Sashriq. Send the Chancellor in. Alone.\"And Sashriq gestured for Ryden to go forward. He would have to walk through the fountain water that would come up to his ankles before inevitably pushing aside the sheer material of the tent and seeing the Lady of Sakand for the first time.", "link_list": ["/user/1458"], "image_list": [], "html": "As "}, "post-54331": {"user": "Ryden Greyiron", "user_num": 1458, "timestamp": "1477201838000", "message": "Ryden gracefully disembarked from the elephantine creature's platform, following behind Sashriq at a suitably deferent and independent pace. As he approached the young men to have his feet bathed, he bundled up a small amount of the fabric that made up his robes and pulled it back, revealing a long boot that could be undone merely by unfastening the triad of button-like clasps holding the length of the boot above the ankle together. For this exploratory part of his journey, Ryden had elected to wear a light and simple, if elegant and quite clearly expensive, set of robes as opposed to his overly formal, complicated and bulky official outfit. After his own washing ritual was completed, the chancellor beckoned to the second-most junior of the guards he had accompanying him - without coincidence, he happened to be the man Ryden had entrusted the protection of his armour to. Once he, too, had been cleaned, he continued up behind Ryden. \"Very well. Thank you, ambassador,\" said Ryden, his eyes meeting those of the Sakandian man. Like his tone, his gaze was cool, calm, and dispassionate. Following his dismissal of Sashriq's impertinent question during their transit, the chancellor had very little interest in the ambassador or what he had to say.  Indeed, he had far more interest in the intricately-detailed golden stairs they seemed to be about to walk on. Throughout his past work and efforts, Ryden had studied and thus gained an interest in and a more-than-healthy appreciation for the incredibly rich historical aspect of life. He wondered as to the significance of the inscriptions and their purpose. It was a mystery for another time, he supposed. Taking the ambassador's signal to go first, Ryden began to make his way up the stairs with the grace and poise of a former swordsman - which is to say that he still looked dignified, despite the relative haste with which he moved. While his clerk-cum-attendant-cum-guard was experienced at keeping up with the pace the chancellor kept, there was every chance that the umbrella boy would have to scramble to keep up with the unexpected speed he exhibited.As they proceeded through the tall building, the small retinue the chancellor kept was often halted as he took an opportunity to look around and enjoy the spectacular gardens that thrived in the building, as well as the rather fine art that adorned the wall. Perhaps most interesting to him, though, were, as far as he knew, the totally unique little hummingbirds. They flitted about as the crystals embedded in their feathers flashed in the sunlight, producing magnificent, sparkling, rainbow patterns, and sending them dancing across the walls. As the small party were stopped as they emerged from the mouth of the staircase and onto the floor, Ryden grazed his eyes across the components that came together to make a scintillating atmosphere. From the gentle rushing sound of the spouts bursting from the pool, to the glimmering tiles that floored it, to the brilliant canopy of exotic flowers and vines above, it fit at least some of what he knew of Fairuz from his basic research - she was wealthy and had excellent taste. Looking to the pavilion in the centre, shelled with a gauzy film, he saw who he supposed to be the lady herself, lounging on a mound of pillows. He resolved to wait until Sashriq announced him, which he did in short order.As Sashriq was dismissed, Ryden strode through the water, with little regard of the fact that his trousers were getting soaked, at least to his ankles. Indeed, the water was a pleasantly cool refreshment in the otherwise-hot Sakandian day. Eventually, after crossing the great pool, he stepped up onto the pavilion, pulling back the thin membrane that obscured the Lady of Sakand within, and, as he pulled it back, he got his first look of the lady Fairuz herself.Regarding her for a few moments without saying a word, Ryden moved in through the doorway and into the pavilion. He continued to consider the ravishingly beautiful woman in front of him, before finally deigning to speak in perfect, albeit heavily-accented Sakandian. \"My lady Fairuz. It is... an honour to meet you.\" Smoothly, he bowed half-waistedly, before straightening up again to look back at her.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Ryden gracefully disembarked from the elephantine creature's platform, following behind Sashriq at a suitably deferent and independent pace.

In alarmingly similar amounts, he lusted after and was angered by the young woman sitting opposite to him.

Fairuz, though... she disarmed him in a way that very few others managed. Not Naoki... their brand of conflict was far too vocal to be considered in the same sort as this. The only thing that was nearly in a comparable league was his conversation with Grandma, but, again, that was a totally different combat.

It was then that he would be able to see the drape of the gown she wore, a piece of intricately decorated silk that was clasped at one shoulder with a ruby broach... and then left to drape so dramatically that it left her breast naked before there was a clasp low, low on her opposite hip. The material parted, and her opposite leg was left as naked and lush as her breast. On her bare shoulder was a swirling henna design of a sun and a flower and a hummingbird-- purposely appropriate given the insignia of their two worlds-- that trailed down her arm, but also over her ripe and full breast. A wonderfully made golden chain with flattened gold coins made a sort of... barely there cover for her breast, that rested against its top but now the sweet curve of its bottom. That same chain draped over her shoulder,sparkling every so often with a small sapphire or emerald or amethyst. She wore masterpieces -- the jewelry, the temporary tattoo, the material that was so intricately woven down its one covered side that it depicted an ancient Sakandi tale -- and she was the display case for it.Once the wine was in hand, she shifted over the pillows, the opening if her skirt parting even wider so that when she finally did settle near him, her legs were almost totally bare and had revealed a thigh chain jewelry piece subtly wrapped around her once hidden thigh. The train of her gown was spread out over the pillows, very much like a peacock might spread it's feathers. She handed him his goblet, her naked shoulder and breast near him, her perfume gentle but spiced.\"I have never been to Isra.

Moreso than a naked breast, it was the twirling henna that danced across her body that interested him - which, of course, was not to say that said breast did not\u00a0interest him. Unlike her own accessories, his clothes were no masterpieces. A rich, midnight-blue coat, with short sleeves and a sidefront that trailed down to half his thighs, bound tightly to him with a belt of the same colour and material, rested over a comparatively plain, if not still luxuriously soft and well-made, short-bodied, yet long-sleeved burgundy tunic, hemmed with golden thread, to capture both the colours of Isra, and his own personal colours. Along the hem, the governing principles of Isra was inscribed, in the same golden thread, whereas on the coat, the hem, and subsequently the inscription of Ryden's house words, was finished in silver. These inscriptions, of course, were not written in anything so vulgar as the Common tongue, but instead the obscure, if not nigh-upon extinct High Vintic script, a winding, ornate calligraphy that was far more suitable for noble clothing. It was not overstated, nor was it particularly exuberant, but it was elegant, it was tasteful, and, most importantly, it was symbolic.\u00a0\"Why would I be worried, my lady?\" Ryden spoke softly, in the same Gauldic she spoke. It was a language he had always enjoyed, and so spoke it with a degree of proficiency par to that of a native. \"You do not daunt me, nor do your men outside.\" Which, to an extent, was true, and Ryden would, of course, play the extent that was not true off. He was enjoying this exchange, on a certain level. She was like a fieldmouse for his hawk to toy with, and that was an enjoyable thing.As she shifted across the pillows towards him, he accepted the offered goblet, taking a delicate sip. He always preferred the taste of wine to that of ale or lager, a side effect of having been brought up in a noble house, he supposed. All the same, the drink he had in hand now was of a superb quality - as he had observed early on in his life, the origin of a wine gave it an idiosyncratic flavour, and the Sakandian was no exception. It was citrus, tannic and dry, something that he figured was fairly typical of wha he had seen of Sakand so far.Whether to frown, or admit defeat when Fairuz unsubtly mocked Isra was a decision than in and of itself, defeated Ryden. Despite the sense of patriotism he felt for his city, and, more to the point, the city in which he was an elected official, her criticisms were... not unjustified.\u00a0\"To call the people of Isra lazy\u00a0is hardly fair. It is only through their hard work that they can be happy with their circumstances, through their perseverance that there is a booming housing market and economy, through their dedication that their military, mages and minds are the finest. It is a good life, that of an Isran citizen, but it does not come for free.\" The fact that his words, to a degree, were harsh, was somewhat mollified by the tone he used - gentle, soft, and not rebuking, but recommending. \"I am not Isra, and you are not Goraia. It is not a question of what Isra wants. Isra needs nor wants anything from Goraia. It is a question of what I want, and I daresay the answer will be not what Goraia wants, but what you want. All the same, there is time yet for that, and it is a heavy subject, best for the halls of diplomacy, if you will, rather than the... 'pavilion of casual discussion and reading of international treatises'.\" He turned from his goblet to the young lady of Sakand, who had come uncomfortably, or, should he say, comfortably close to him.

He chastised her for her outlook of Isra, and rode with a rebuttal. \"Perhaps in Isra and her territories, and perhaps even in Gauldin, politicians may sit in stiff chairs at stiff tables,\" Fairuz said with the wave of her hand as she sat up and leaned forward, displaying her naked back to him with the slender line of her spine and the teasing of dimples at the shallow of her back, \"but you are not in Isra, nor Goraia,\" she commented over the caramel skin of her shoulder, gracefully leaning back with a plate of food instead of her wine.\"I am comfortable to speak here,\" Fairuz told him.
