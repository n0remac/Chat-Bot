The room was simple and clean, with nothing to boast of wealthy other than the obvious pride and workmanship that went into the intricate details of the windows and columns themselves. No gold. No silver. No jewels. A desk. A lamp. a shelf with scrolls.And the old priest.The man first spoke in a language that was not Sakandi, but not a language Roarin would understand, either. When it became obvious that Roarin didn't understand, the man switched to another language -- this was sounding harsh, almost nordic.Then, with a chuckle, he went to his final language, a language that Roarin did understand. \"Forgive me. I have trouble figuring out what language you pale men with bears speak. You must be thirsty.\"He leaned forward, and there was a small table-trey on the ground that was not so far from where Roarin rested, and he poured tea into the cup and handed it to him.\"You have quite the demon inside you, my friend,\" the man said, his voice low and roughened yet soothing all the same. \"I am Tiqal. You are in Sakand, more specifically in the Temple of Serenity. We found no papers of identification in your things, so you are unfortunately under house arrest until Lady Fairuz clears your name.

The High Priest was no exception.\"You may find that many of our texts are written in Ancient Sakandi, Grandma,\" Fairuz said, her head turned to watch the priest's slow walk toward them. \"And it's a language taught only within Sakand itself. We have been away from the world for so long, that you will perhaps not find anything of interest dealing with other nations, but if you don't mind a history lesson on Sakand and her people, then you'll be in for a treat.\"Fairuz turned her head away from Ramesses and looked at Grandma. \"The man that can help you more thoroughly will soon stand before us.\" She waited until Ramesses was closer, then bowed her head in acknowledgement to the High Priest's respectful bow to her. The beautiful woman pushed up onto her feet with a dancer's grace.\"Ramesses,\" she said and reached out to touch his arm lightly. \"Grandma has come to unlock the treasures of Sakand, due to her own curiosity,\" Fairuz explained. \"You will help her, won't you? She is my esteemed guest, and I insist that she stay with me in the Palace once she is finished here.\" Her jade eyes moved to Grandma, and the smile that accompanied the look spoke of an actual genuine pleasure to be hospitable. \"Indeed, why don't you join us for dinner, Ramesses?

I am known as Grandma and you could consider me a\u2026 traveler of sorts.\u201d Grandma didn\u2019t feel the need to go into detail about her position with Isra. Fairuz could tell the High Priest herself if she thought such information was needed.\u201dGrandma didn\u2019t respond immediately to the High Priest\u2019s question about what he could help her with, which worked out for her, as Fairuz told the man the reason for Grandma\u2019s visit herself. Fairuz was quite sly, requesting that she stay at the palace under the pretense of hospitality. Although she was certain they would be hospitable to her, she suspected the main reason for the invitation was so that Fairuz could better keep an eye on her movements. Still, if Grandma wanted to go somewhere unnoticed, she had methods that made it irrelevant where she stayed. \u201cI really don\u2019t want to impose upon you, Emira, but if you insist\u2026 I certainly won\u2019t say no to a good meal and a place to sleep the night. Also, it is as the Emira says, High Priest. I am interested in reading some of the various text that your library here possesses.

It wasn\u2019t something she would care that much if they discovered she could use, but she\u2019d rather keep it secret for now. Gathering a small amount of mana, she first cast a spell to obscure others from sensing when she cast other spells.
