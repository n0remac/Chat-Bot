Many apologize! I am Miroell, of House Oramaj.\" Miroell bowed her head slightly, yet even the slightly forward balance seemed to threaten her body to topple forward. Miroell quickly moved her right foot in front of herself, catching herself before she started falling, and then rose up again, her cheeks blushed from the lack of imperiousness. \"S-sorry. Much weight.\" Miroell said without much further explaining, her hand now firmly holding on-to Skarlet's. \"We are go to Bath house! Most certain you will like!\" Miroell said, her skin slightly \"glowing with happiness\". Mute is, of course, following the pair from behind. \"Have you ever bathed?\" Miroell asked with incredible innocence, once again establishing her trouble with the Common Tongue.
