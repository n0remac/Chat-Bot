Her obvious foreign looks hinted that she must have had mixed blood in her ancestry. Some found her exotic, others not so much.

Once Maharet had distracted Miroell's attention from bouncing her breasts, Mute was already moving.Mute grabbed a simple silk cloth from a vendor nearby, the cloth unfolding rather visually and dramatically in front of the store-vendor who was trying to get a better view of the action. His trained eyes did however notice the 'thiefing' attendant and proceeded to start shouting. \"H-HE--...\" His words were quickly taken away from him as he proceeded to see what Mute was in-fact doing with the silk.Miroell proceeded to look up from her own breasts, a considerable 'slip' of her hot-pink areolas was plainly visible for a brief moment, perhaps two seconds, before the massive breasts were completely covered by Mute's borrowed silk cloth. An action very few men of nobility would have sanctioned on their wifes, and even fewer ladies of nobility would have allowed at all! However, Miroell remained simply oblivious to the sudden silk covering her breasts. \"Huh?\" Was all that Miroell was able to release before Mute held up the unfurled silk cloth at Miroell's neck, and used her other hand to pull Miroell's right arm to that position.Without really making a conscious choice, Miroell's finger gripped on the silk cloth, and Mute went busy on the cloth. A lot of suggestive shuffling happened beneath the silk covers, and all that Miroell chimed up was \"A-ah! C-cold!\", followed with a short gasp and a moan as she was put into place, Miroell biting on her lower lip as she was forced to endure what seemed to be considerable effort of Mutes part to cover up the areolas of Miroell. Granted, Maharet could accurately assume that Miroell would have ignored the obvious display on the bases that 'She couldn't do anything about it'. Not that it would have been the most egregious display that has befallen Miroell's public display, this did really rank up with them. Thankfully, the Golden Road was quite crammed at this point, and only the most forward positioned people and a few shopkeepers could properly bear witness to the display that was abound to spread through the City in a firestorm. 'Another day in the city with that Bimbo...' could somehow be heard in the background.Sooner than expected, yet longer than hoped, Mute re-emerged from beneath the silk cloth, and took away the silk from Miroell's blushing figure, her teethes still grinding into her lower lip while Mute folded the silk up again, paid 'Damages' to the shopkeep and took up her previous position. Maharet could see a better picture of the two's relationship now, and a hint of the cleverness the Head of Oramaj displayed with the choice of Mute, a raised tribes-woman with little regard to social standing and a certain rough-handedness that was required with Miroell, to literally babysit the incredibly simple Miroell.However, the display of maturity wasn't over, was thanks to the energized handling, there were now rather obvious headlights in front of her top, with pleasant, if not sizable bulges presenting them outwards. \"A-ah. Yes. Hm... Maybe you would do me the pleasure of teaching me?\" Miroell onward from the interrupted conversation as if nothing had happened. \"... T-though I would understand if you declined. I'm certain that a high lady of the court have many businesses to take care of and can't spare the time with me.\" Miroell said, shockingly diplomatic about it, though you could see a hint of sadness in her eyes as she was unfamiliar with the concept of 'Poker face', and 'Hiding emotions'.

One of her own handmaidens reached out and put a gentle hand on her arm as Miroell's mute servant went to rescue the flesh situation, but it all seemed so obscene.

They seemed to be just a huge nuisance and furthered the opinion of many Miroell was good for nothing but one single purpose -- and only if you were into that amount of flesh.The handmaiden wanted to pull Maharet away -- after all, both the women were under the silk and it was obvious that a lot of hand groping and sensual actions were going on beneath -- and Maharet should have gone.

Please...\" Whispered one of Maharet's handmaidens to Maharet. She gently reached out and Pat the handmaiden's hand, then looked at Miroell.\"I'm sorry, Miroell, I won't be able to teach you to swim.
