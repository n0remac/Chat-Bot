Indeed, it appears that he knew slightly more than the Emira herself as she was unaware of the decided upon fate of the gems by their rightful owner.

Sipping at his tea he considers the two things she is asking of him, Cieltherium and a political favor. Both were quite valuable as asking for a king's intercession even where his authority was not absolute was still not something to discount. At present, she was offering Sakandi water of which he knew had not insignificant value, he didn't know what was fact and what was fiction when it came to the magical liquid but she was right nothing he heard suggested it was as valuable as the crystals, if for no other reason than it was far easier to aquire. The ball was thrust into his court and he considers what the Emira had that his kingdom wanted. Spices, perhaps but even such a valuable luxury paled in comparison to Cieltherium. Political marriage perhaps? Have the Emira marry her eldest daughter to his son should such a girl be born? But no, while his own arranged marriage had worked out well he wouldn't feel right promising his son to someone yet to be born, even if it could, in theory, give his future bloodline a claim to all of Sakand. Gold, of course, was preposterous the quantity the Emira would have to ship could potentially bankrupt her nation if a single ship was lost. That left Sakand's unique magic the Djinn, the bloodline based magics could prove quite potent if properly studied at the Academy. \"To get a feel for what I should ask for, I first need to know exactly how much Cieltherium you are looking to acquire Emira.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Renaux turns slightly to the side so he can more comfortably face the Emira listening to her as she explains the events surrounding the Croerian water gem.

I thought we were negotiating a business contract between our nations. Is this how it is done in Gauldin? Each side making quips and taking shots at the supposed ineptitude of the other side? Perhaps it is a negotiation technique, to intimidate and make the other side cringe and bow away, thus making the contract beneficial to you. In Sakand, when we come to the table to discuss terms, only the terms are discussed.\"And if he tried to speak her, she'd do as he did to her -- hold up a hand to prevent him from speaking.\"We are here to simply and resolutely discuss terms, and nothing else. I tell you what I'd like, and you tell me your price, and then we settle on one. There are no other asides, there are no other assumptions, there are no other low blows or pot shots. If something is offered and declined, then as negotiators and contract builders, we simply make a note of it to ourselves and move on.\"She took a breath, her jade eyes having gotten more fiery since she began her speech.

Frankly, I found your counter offer of exactly seventeen years of payment insulting, both to me personally and to my country.\" Another brief pause long enough for her to offer a rebuttal, though, he still clearly had more to say. He would continue on once she voices any disagreement. \"Not to mention the offense you paid in the implication that my own kingdoms magical knowledge may not prove of some value in your project, dismissing that offer out of hand struck me as another insult. Just because yours are more oblique than mine does not make them any less insulting. And if you think or argue that insulting was not your intent, while neither was an insult the intent in my words, as ill-chosen as they might have been, yet you chose to take it. Still, you have my apologies for the inadvertent offense I paid you. I thought we were speaking candidly so I spoke to you with little thought to coloring my words.\" Another pause, he didn't seem particularly angry and only a bit contrite but mostly just calm and in control, this wasn't about speaking down to her just speaking his mind. There is another pause as he lets her respond before he moves to the next point he wishes to cover. \"If you wish to keep this merely to negotiations, I will focus on that. As I see it, Sakandi water is a luxury but not one my country is currently crying out for. Your magics are interesting and I am sure that the members of my academy would love to discuss the nature of magic with people who have a different perspective, but I don't see this as necessary either. Finally, it can take years for new farmland to turn a profit so the money from the taxation will be a relative pittance for some time. That is how I see the value of what I have asked of you, I say this not to speak down to you but rather to explain how I am assessing the value of what I am asking for.\" The king looks at the Emira expectantly his tone again carried no hint that he was speaking down to her, only that he was speaking plainly to her. Indeed, despite the Emira's bruised feelings, the king's tone had never carried a hint of arrogance, contempt, or anything that may suggest that he was trying to insult her.Unless the Emira decided to cut him off or order him out for that he'd continue on. \"Thus far I have given ground easily in these negotiations letting myself be argued down with far more ease than I should because I respect and admire what you are trying to do for your people. However, if we are treating this as pure business; your grand plan requires Cieltherium or something similar, which makes what I am offering a need of yours. While you can only offer me things that my country wants.\" He pauses and then shrugs his shoulders. \"Therefore I feel justified in asking for more favorable terms than what you have thus far given to me as a counter offer.\"At this point, there is a change in his tone of voice, in the early discussions his tone had carried a certain warmth in it because he'd found he liked the Emira and her ambition. That warmth is gone, but it's been replaced with a measure of respect. \"Seven percent of all taxation revenues from the new land for fifteen years or until you no longer require cieltherium, whichever is longer. Fifteen barrels of Sakandi water a month for fifteen years or until you no longer require cieltherium, whichever is longer. Six of your majes on retainer for ten years or until you no longer require cieltherium, whichever is longer.

Each syllable that came from his lips seemed even more and more condescending. And finally, at the end of it all, it seemed that her irritation at being insulted by him HAD effected the negotiations, because even though she hadn't offered a return negotiation for his last offer -- and even though he himself had said that the tax was non-negotiable -- Fairuz' words to inform King Renaux that she was offended by him had him now asking for more, upping the tax that had been supposedly non-negotiable, upping the amount of Sakandi water that he said with casual ease was not even needed by his people, and demanding more majes.It seemed that by the Emira asking for respect, and asking that the negotiations be simply about the terms rather than about opinions and emotions and insults, had resulted in the King pushing for more.He did not seem to take criticism well, nor verbal warnings. He seemed to do as he liked as he liked it, say what he wanted as he wanted, and when he felt insulted, to push for harsher leverage than where he was. Even if Fairuz HAD low-balled him -- which of course she had, that was what one did in negotiations -- he could have countered with another offer similar to his first. Instead, he'd chosen to stay low, and only after Fairuz asked for respect, did he then choose to press high.But he was right. His country had the cieltherium. His country had everything, and hers had nothing, and she was the one making the ask. But in this day, in this moment, the hard-working Emira who had had to swallow pill after pill with Goraia, and Isra, found that she could not swallow a pill for Gauldin.\"I think, perhaps,\" Fairuz said quietly, evenly, \"we should end our negotiations for today, and perhaps take it up again the day after tomorrow, Your Highness.\" She turned, her back to him as she moved to go behind her desk.

This time he offers no counter argument as he did not see the point, apparently, the Emira took personal affront to his opinions and chose to take them as an insult. Her pride was misconstruing his logic as condescension and there was little he could do about that. The Emira had also misunderstood why he was pushing for more. It was true he did not handle verbal warnings well, he was a warrior before a king and he responded to hostility with hostility. However, it was not her criticism of his character that had caused him to push up the prices. He did not like being taken advantage of and Fairuz had continually pushed for more when he was already giving her a good deal. Then when he'd finally tried to put some perspective on the deal she'd decided to act personally insulted instead of feeling an ounce of shame. He had been trying to do a less than obvious favor for her by acting the part of poor negotiator and instead of jumping on his generosity she'd pushed for more. Which had lead to him finally spelling out just what her place was within the negotiation.As she put it, it was a hard pill to swallow but if you had asked the king the only reason she had to swallow it was due to her own pride and greed.
