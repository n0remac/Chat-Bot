She was caught off-guard by the call of a Peacock, but was surprised to see the beautiful fowl, they looked like they had long coat-tails. Skarlet even got to see one Peacock shake it's tail feathers open like a fan to display it's hypnotic pattern! The smell of the incense was also pleasing as Skarlet liked spice."}, "post-72359": {"user": "Lady Aishah of Sakand", "user_num": 2470, "timestamp": "1504202794000", "message": "Aishah had walked the palace hallways her entire life and because of that the beauty sometimes got lost to her just a small bit.
