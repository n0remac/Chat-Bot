The Emir of the Infinite Deep had arrived with absolutely no expense spared, flashing his wealth. The Sakandi people had also done their best, but considering they weren't even a decade away from a previous century of decay, there was evidence of a city that had almost-been on the brink of extinction and was still making its way back.Still, Sakand was gorgeous -- like a beautiful necklace that was steadily being cleaned to its bright and shininy glory, and Fairuz in her sapphire-and-gold palace was its pendant. She moved away from the balcony, sure that it would take the Maridi a while to get through the city as they kept their place slow to truly experience the fanaticism of the Sakandi people.Fairuz didn't think of them as saviors, however.

She had to think very carefully on who she was going to attach at her rounded hip.By the time Emir Alim al-Rashid  had finally made it to the palace, the Emira was standing in her own gorgeous glory.
