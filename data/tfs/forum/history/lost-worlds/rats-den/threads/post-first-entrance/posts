Not in the jeweler's shops of the Diamond District, though. Oh no. Shopping there was good for her image, but it was so boring compared to the shops down here. So much more expensive, too. Not that the money was any real problem, of course. Finishing her drink, the Godmother stood up and removed her necklace, placing it on the countertop.\"Thank you for the drink, Mr. Mallarky.
