Then again, no one particularly cares in the Den of the Rats. A number of items can be bought or sold, from foods and clothes, to spells and potions, to armor and artifacts, to exotic pets and wares from anywhere in the world!

Mercenaries, fighters, slaves, animals - it's all a varied good to be passed with currency. While most of the normal and exotic goods are sold in the vendors crowding the streets, the platforms and pedestals situated in the center of the plazas are normally loud with salesmen pitching out prices for the next live good to be sold.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/MzN9Tnp.jpg", "http://i.imgur.com/UjPnxsE.jpg"], "html": "<i>The heart of the very underground city - where virtually anything can be found to buy, trade or sell.<br><br/></br></i>"}}
