For many years, the two married and happy. It was until she gave birth that things went wrong.\u00a0First was Zaltos, who his father was proud of and shed a tear of joy over. When his brother, Demigrem was born, things went south. He came out dead, but alive, something his father overlooked with Zaltos. The only reason Demigrem's was noticed was because of his grey skin and horn stubs.\u00a0A rage encured; fire filled the skies and heavens of Amun Ra. The father drew his broadsword off his back and immediately beheaded his wife and spit on her body as she hit the ground. He black blood immediately consumed by the fires. The children were next, but they would not fall to such a fate.\u00a0All was a test of Amun Ra. The man had failed, allowing his judging ways to be the end of him. As the broadsword was brought down to slice the babies on the table, a blinding white light exploded throughout the space, eliminating all the fires and pausing time for a moment. The father couldn't move, all he could see was his blade about to slice through both of his children. In this time, a voice boomed, explaining to the man about the test.\u00a0The father began to cry when he realized exactly what he did. He placed his sword againt the table and kneeled beside his wife. There was nothing he could do to save her and he was the cause of it. All he could do was consume her energy and create a gift for their children. \u00a0 The father stood up and placed his hands on his sword that he had leaning on the table. He would begin to chant while tears rolled down his face, facing the fact he let his anger take over and failed everyone he loved. A Phoenix would rise from the man before it and him vanished into the sword. The markings and writing on the sword explain the tale of this Kiraxo tragedy and what power this sword has. \u00a0Mid-LifeAfter the incident that occurred during his birth, he was raised by Prophets of the Kiraxo Scrolls. Zaltos became well versed in Religious Magics and Fire Magics. For two hundred years, Zaltos remained under under their wings. It wasn't until Demigrem revolted and sided with Evil that Zaltos was given his fate. The only way to combat Evil was with Evil, and Zaltos was the one who could make this occur.\u00a0Zaltos was cast to earth, where he would gather refugees during the first Cataclysm about 300 A.D.. These refugees came by the thousands and left the ways of their lands where they belonged. It was rough, but these refugees were able to hold off enemies under Zaltos's lead and construct large tribes throughout The Phoenix State. After fighting for their freedom, when the attacks from enemy kings ceased, the people isolated themselves from the world.\u00a0One hundred years before the Great Cataclysm known by the modern people, The Phoenix State opened up. Their abundance of valuable stones and metals from their mass amount of mining was sought after by all the nations. The Phoenix State when from a band of large tribes to large cities and powerful armies. They did trade with everyone and held a powerful spot over the economy.\u00a0When the Great Cataclysm began to unfold, Zaltos vanished and The Phoenix State isolated themselves again, only making things worse by crushing economies that depended on them. While the world suffered, The Phoenix State flourished within itself despite it's fear with Zaltos no longer there to lead them. While they did no trade and would kill any soldiers, as always, they were taking in refugees, carrying on the will of their missing leader. As an unexpected side-effect, The Phoenix State would be forgot about due to the high amounts of people that were killed in the world. All that remained was small farm villages and lost warriors.\u00a0It wasn't until a week before the Citadel in Isra rose, that Zaltos rose. While The Phoenix State was just starting to creep out of the desert, Zaltos was finding his way home. He had just been thrown back into the Overworld and was suffering memory loss. It didn't take long before he had his throne back and leading The Phoenix State back to it's former Glory. He now sits as one of two Pharaohs and a leader with Phoenix Imperium.WeaponryThe sword, now known as Phoenix Blade, can only be held by one with Kiraxo blood. This sword has boasted the power of a Phoenix many times. When in battle, this sword almost seems to come to life under the right spell. The sword is dual bladed and beautiful. It's vastly made of what is known as Q-Carbon while trimmed with valuable metals and the details on the blade the same.\u00a0Zaltos has a shield known as the Shield of Amun Ra. It is triangular, outlined in gold and the base metal made of the same Q-Carbon, but a crimson red. On the shield was a Phoenix with the All Seeing Eye of God on it's chest with the Eye of Ra in the center of the All-Seeing Eye. This shield has the capability to blast enemy attacks back at them under the right spell. Without the spell, the shield is still capable of surviving a dragons bite without an issue. As many weapons, this shield is used in a variety of spells.\u00a0Zaltos has an array of armors that he stores within a magical well. Each armor may look different, but most have the same capabilities. The armor has it's own well of magic, boosting Zaltos's magic. The armor can also absorb light and heat to create more power to benefit Zaltos. Other than the magic benefits, this armor is made of the Q-Carbon and can take on hell of a hit. \u00a0Bloodline CapabilitiesAs for Zaltos's bloodline capabilities, he has the Phoenix and the Daywalker. The Daywalker side of his blood gives him inhumane strength, speed, and sight. This traits are very handy in combat, especially in cqc. As another bonus, Zaltos also hosts the healing capabilities of the Daywalker species, meaning slashes, cuts, jabs, and stabs, generally heal quickly. Loss of limbs defnitely takes a lot long to heal, not something that will occur during a batlle. \u00a0The Phoenix gives Zaltos great power also. Not only does he have fire hotter than a dragons, but his armor radiates this heat in battle, causing severe dehydrating and possibly igniting flammable materials. To be put simply, the Phoenix boosts Zaltos's magic a lot, but there's still one trait to the Phoenix he has no awoken and doesn't know exists.\u00a0Zaltos has designed a scapegoat if he is in a corner and death is inevitable. Due to the Phoenix, is Zaltos wishes, he can burn himself alive. In the pile of ash, an egg could be found. If the egg is not found within the ash, it will move into the planet till it reaches the core where it will be incubated. When the time comes, Zaltos is reborn, but his alignment switches; good to evil, evil to good. \u00a0As another special capability drawn from a Phoenix based magic, he can bond with dragons. He has an exceptional bond with a dragon named Trogdor. When together, Zaltos and Trogdor's senses mix, allowing them to view the world from either beings eyes. Generally, the two are more powerful when together and have their own onslaught of attacks they have designed together.PersonalityZaltos himself can be serious or mischievious. He tends to be brutally honest, but has excellent negotiating skills. Zaltos likes to take lead in combative situations, but has been working on letting others take lead. In a nutshell, you will either like Zaltos or you won't.\u00a0Spells:CQC Combinations:", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://captura.cubava.cu/files/2015/04/Dota-2-Heroes-Dragon-Knight-4-Cool-HD.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://captura.cubava.cu/files/2015/04/Dota-2-Heroes-Dragon-Knight-4-Cool-HD.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/><br/></div>"}, "post-21350": {"user": "Lorelei & Lucia", "user_num": 620, "timestamp": "1453183241000", "message": "The fifth paragraph is copied", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The fifth paragraph is copied"}, "post-21353": {"user": "Phoenix Imperium", "user_num": 897, "timestamp": "1453213892000", "message": "Thanks.
