This Ka Dragon is named Gravlor. For many years he had slumbered within his cave, never being bothered by anyone due to the changes in the land. The dragon's eyelids would begin to part, revealing it's solid sapphire eyes. This first thing he seen was darkness, solid black.\u00a0The walls would begin to glisten, reflecting like mirrors. Diamonds and sapphires covered the walls. Gold and other metal treasures covering the floor helped reflect the light. All the reflections cause by the lights that pulsed from the neon blue markings on his wings and body.The mighty dragon would rise, his head pressing against the top of the cave as he stretched. His body, due to his color, looked like a diamond itself. Steam rose from his body as the heat he trapped beneath him came in contact with the moist air. He would begin to check on the other rooms in his cave.\u00a0One room, full of scrolls and magical items was untouched, covered in light snow that had blown in since it was the the end of the main hall. He'd move to check his pools and waters, seeing they were as full and blue as ever. His food source that called these underground waters home was plentiful. \u00a0Everything was as he left it. When he reached the opening, everything outside had changed. It was completely frozen. Nothing existed for miles. Immediately his heart was broken, as the humanoids that called these lands home were like his children. The only reason he was here, the love of the humanoids who worked hard in these lands for what they had, was crushed in their absence. \u00a0Gravlor woke happy, but seeing this, his tear drops would fall from his eyes. In rage from sadness, Gravlor would release a mighty roar that would cause a series of avalanches. With this roar, he would release mighty beams of a blueish white beam of energy that would carve the mountains and cut the air.\u00a0A black cloud filled the air, one that had left the dragon Trogdor. In Gravlor's rage from his sadness, the cloud would enter Gravlor from every opening. His blue lines of energy would grow darker, his eyes following the same path. \u00a0With a mighty flap of his wings, Gravlor blasted into the air. He would leave a trail of destruction as he wrecked the lands that once was his home. How the land had betrayed him and forced his love away. He would seek destruction to any land he came across. If he couldn't have his loves, then no other lands could either.\u00a0Trogdor's anger had found a new host. Destruction would arrive to anyone seen in the beasts path. With Gravlor's power and Trogdor's anger, few could stand to this beast that he knew of. Right now, he knew nothing but revenge. Until the anger was released, Gravlor was dangerous. A broken heart with anger is always a bad mix.\u00a0Gravlor had flown for miles and the first sign of life he came upon was the dry docks on the river. Gravlor would lower his massive body, moving towards the docks and life that called it home. The blue lines of energy that glowed on his body would glow a little more. Inside his chest and throat he was gathering energy. From the sky, it would be hard to tell if the beast was friend or foe.\u00a0By the time one would realize the energy, it would be glowing in his mouth, taking a spherical figure. Around his snout and the energy sphere, a mist like energy that looked like steam would form. Small cracks of energy erupted.\u00a0In mid flight, about one hundred yards, Gavlor would spread his wings and come to an abrupt halt in mid air. As the beast stopped, the air around it would knock a tank over from the immediate power of the instant expansion of the wings. As the body ceased and the wings were fully expanded, the dragon let out a blast of pure energy.\u00a0A blast with a two foot radius would erupt from his mouth. Destruction fell upon anything it contacted. He would release a series of the blasts for two seconds apiece. What was dry docks was now pieces of wood. What lives were there were now in pieces. Nothing could survive the blast of destruction, and anyone within the area would head the mighty explosion of energy and massive roars Gravlor let off as he destroyed the area.\u00a0\"IF I CANNOT LOVE, THAN NEITHER CAN YOU, MOTHER GAIA!\" Gravlor shouted over the area he was destroying.\u00a0About ten Aaedanian troops were trying to return to their posts on the boats. They were far enough away to see the destruction being cast without worry of being harmed. Consisting mostly of Archers, the group instantly took offensive action. One of these soldiers went running to warn the city, knowing that if they didn\u2019t prepare, they could be in danger. \u00a0Three Aaedanian heavy troops locked their shields together, forming a shield wall. The shield in the center had been enchanted by the Magus of the White City to resist energy and magic attacks. The shield was tough, but even it could do so much against a mighty dragon.\u00a0Six archers, with the signature Aaedanian Longbow took aim. Massive arrows, powerful bows and years of training went into their shot. The six archers released their arrows at the dragon's left wing.\u00a0In the distance, a tall skunk like humanoid wanders into the area, smelling strongly of musk from his spray.  His fur was mangled and unkempt. He had no extra belongings except for a large backpack that held a couple of journals, a bow, some arrows, and a belt holding a quartz sword.\u00a0A little bit ahead he sees the dragon and pulls out his bow from his pack. With a swift motion, he\u2019d aim and load the bow in one move, aiming for the dragon's right eye.\u00a0The Aaedians and the skunk wouldn't go unnoticed. A quick blast was directed at the ground infront of the skunk, blasting it with dirt and rock, and possibly knocking him back.\u00a0Next he would tend to the beings on t he ground from Aaeden. Gravlor would do the same to the Aaeden soldiers that he did to the skunk. Except this time, he aimed closer, trying to blow them over and open them up. Enchanted shield or not, the force of the blast hitting the ground and sending rock and dirt at them was a hard hit. The power of the blast exploding on the ground acted like a large battering ram on them. \u00a0\"Vatakawe hofibai! dout vaessi shilta ti resksultha sia dense ternocki, shar sia othi shilta pierce erekess dout yobolat!\" Gravlor shouted at the soldiers as their arrows bounced off the dense scale natural armor the Ka Dragon had devloped over the past three millineums.\u00a0Gravlor, after his blast and speech dove towards the recently blasted Aaedens. His wings would take one mighty flap and fold in on his body, turning him into a bullet. A mighty screech and roar erupted as the dragon closed in on the soldiers to eat them.\u00a0\"dask gaia, dout vraktor geou.taste jennu! si charis wux ulnot vur zahhar lae wux tepoha authot ekess ve.\" Gravlor thought to himself.\u00a0Despite the conflict, a flock of blue jays with sapphire eyes. They would peck on the dead bodies, starting with eyeballs and any open wounds. It would seem as though these blue birds were possessed by the effects of Trogdor's Anger that held Gravlor's emotions hostage.\u00a0Following the cries for help, Ashley dashed towards the eastern river post to see the giant metal like dragon attacking the Aaedian soldiers.\u00a0\"Wonder if he's a fire dragon or not....\" She said as she got ready to head back to Renalt.\u00a0Next to show was Andraste, flanking the Aaedian soldier who leads her to the fight. She's hardly looking her best, as she hasn\u2019t eaten in months, and it shows. She was more pale skinned than she usually was, her robes luckily hiding the worst of the damage. \u00a0She would use her twisted oak staff to support herself. The obsidian stone at the top would glisten in the light splendidly, contrasting greatly with its Andraste\u2019s lackluster appearance. Despite this and the current situation, Andraste oozes an aura of serenity, a calm, placid smile drawn across her face.\u00a0\"Thank you for bringing me here,\" she says to the soldier in soothing tones, \"you should leave, now. You will not be able to help in this battle. Many of your compatriots already appear to have fallen.\" \u00a0The Aaedian soldier attempts to argue, but Andraste insists, and her words can be very compelling. The soldier retreats back toward the citadel, and Andraste turns to face the danger. \u00a0\"Great dragon,\" she shouts in the guttural draconic tongue, her voice carrying surprisingly well despite her apparent physical weakness, \"may I ask what troubles you? We mean you no harm! Please, cease your attack!\"\u00a0Her mentors had taught her that a diplomatic solution should always be sought before combat. Any intelligent creature can be reasoned with, and dragons are certainly intelligent. Ashley arrived in time to see Andraste attempt at diplomacy with the dragon.\u00a0\"Wait....who's the lady in red?\" Ashley asked the ones with her.\u00a0After scooping up a soldier that had fallen, Gravlor heard Andraste. He would turn to make his way for her. He would land on all four, his wings fully expanded, and a bloody corpse of a soldier whos blood ran down his jaw and the center of his neck.\u00a0He would chomp down on the soldier and swallow him infront of Andraste. He extended his neck forward, blowing a massive blast of air. \u00a0\"Sorceress, Mother Gaia must pay... direct me to your enemies and I will leave... I should devour you for even trying, but you... Mother Gaia has cursed you as she has me...\" He spoke, feeling her magic.\u00a0He was negotiable for the moment. One wrong move and he would snap. All he wanted to do was destroy those that Mother Gaia had blessed, not cursed.\u00a0\"Dragon, I sense a great rage within you,\" answers Andraste, still speaking in the draconic tongue, her smile remaining despite her proximity to such a dangerous beast. \"It is true, we are both cursed. Please, allow me to help you end our suffering, together. I think I could help you remove this curse that Gaia has so unfairly placed upon you. Would taking away Mother Gaia's satisfaction with your curse not be eternally more gratifying than simply playing into her hands?\"\u00a0She takes a slow step forward and bows before the dragon. \"I do not wish for us to fight. You seem a wronged and tormented creature. I understand this pain.\" \u00a0The magical aura of serenity continues to ooze from her very being, a great contrast to the aura of rage emanating from Ka. It was a silent way to try and calm the mighty beast without triggering the anger. With such an anger in Gravlor, Andraste had to try.\u00a0\"Damn....wish I didn't skip Draconic class...\" Ashley muttered under her breath as she watched the two speak from a distance.\u00a0Levi had heard what was going on and rode to the River Crossing. He got off the horse he was using once he reached the area and approached where the fight had been taking place. The Aedanian mage was about to give his soldiers back up when he saw Andraste show up. \u00a0\"What is that woman doing?\" Levi was concerned that Andraste was putting herself in a position where she could be killed. He could see they seemed to be talking, but had no idea what about.\u00a0Closely behind Ashley, Billy gulps down the rest of his lunch. He points at the large dragon hundreds of meters away, looking at Ash \"Check this crazy shit.\" He whispers loudly.\u00a0He unfurls what he has been carrying all this way. At first it is a bunch of wooden blocks, steel cylinders, and a bow of some sort. But he sets to work immediately, and like a maestro on the keys or an artist on a canvas, he makes something beautiful. In under 2 minutes, he has constructed one of the most fantastic, elaborate crossbows one would find in the free lands. \u00a0It was longer than the Elf was tall, and resembled more a handheld ballista. He reaches into his rucksack, and draws a shiney \"bolt\" with a shiney red rune as big as his forearm, loading it. As he draws back three strings with the aid of a mechanical lever, his whole body is tense, and sweat already begins to break out. Billy had been toting around a handheld siege weapon for god knows how long just for this sort of an occasion. \u00a0Locked and loaded, he props it on his knee and licks his thumb, testing the wind. \"Ash, where should I hit it?\"\u00a0\"The FUCK are you doing?!\" She whispered angrily to Billy as she tried to push the ballista away.\u00a0\"Can't you see that lady's trying to diffuse the situation?! Attack it now and it'll roast you in three seconds!\"\u00a0\"But... dragon slaying... fine...\" Billy sighs.\u00a0\"Let's just see how this plays out. For now...\" Ashley responded.\u00a0Renalt runs up behind Ashley, \"Where's eh dr- oh, there it is! Come on, why are you just standing here? Are you dragon watchers or dragon slayers?\"\u00a0As he finished his sentence, he drew his Candy Sword. An oddity as it was, it had it\u2019s purpose. Candy or not, he\u2019d fight the dragon!\u00a0\"Not until that woman finishes talking to it! If we attack now, she's dead.\" , Ashley spoke to Renalt.\u00a0\"What? Talking to it? Crazy wench.\" Renalt responded with a sarcastic tone.\u00a0Renalt then looked over at the woman in red, noticing that she is indeed talking to the dragon. Who in their right mind does that? He didn\u2019t know and thought she was absolutely nuts.\u00a0\"Crazy sorcerers. I'll never understand them.\", Renalt mumbled to himself.\u00a0Renalt then pulled out a bag of gummy worms and starts chewing on one, offering them to his companions. Such a delicious treat, something they could eat while enjoying the show. That, or he\u2019d do it to just forget all the craziness at the moment, all with the power of his candy.\u00a0\"Try it. They're lime flavored.\" Renalt spoke as he tried to dish them out.\u00a0Wheez- \u201cplease sir, I just\u201d \u2013wheez- \u201cjust wanted some,-wheez- \u201c sweets OH HEAVENS NO!\"\u00a0It didn't take Kate long before she caught on. \"Wait... So the dragon slaying-thingy wasn't just a marketing ploy? I thought it was supposed to be a pi\u00f1ata at most...\" \u00a0Seeing Renalt drawing his sword sent a chill down Kate\u2019s spine, \"You aren't... Seriously gon- gonna fight that-\" She slowly raised her sandy finger up to the sky, pointing at the dragon, then tracing it back to the cane sword. \"W-with that?\" \u00a0Her body was shaking all over, \"We\u2019re all gonna die!!!\"\u00a0\"You should see what his master used to fight it. Apparently, you can make swords out of chocolate.\", Ashley spoke, being rather sarcastic when speak to Ashley, mocking Renalt\u2019s weapon.\u00a0\"Calm down, girl.\", Renalt spoke as he waved his sword in the air.\u00a0\"This? This is no ordinary blade. It's the highest-quality elfin steel. It was forged in a volcano out of a fallen star. It's taken the heads of bandits, bears, and beasts. Over 200 years old. I bought it at a pawn shop. So don't worry about me, girl. Now, are you going to help? Because if you do, you can get discounted fudge at my shop!\"\u00a0\"Woah! You are gonna stick that into someone's eye, waving it around like that...\" Kate shouted as she backed off, eyeing the man carefully.\u00a0\"And besides, that ain't no bear! That's a frigging tall-arse, fire-breathing, metal-scaled, sharp-toothed, white dragon!\" \u00a0Kate would take a deep breathe and speak calmly to Renalt, \"At least let Billy shoot first...\"\u00a0\"See,\" Billy the Elf says, lightly smacking Ashley's leg and gesturing to the new girl, \"SOMEONE fuckin\u2019 believes in me!\"\u00a0Billy's hand would feel a stinging sensation after smacking Ashley. Ashley was so upset that she had smoke rising from her cloak while she glared at him. She was a hot tempered, fire wielding, dryad of great power, and smacking her wasn\u2019t welcomed.\u00a0Renalt ignored Billy and Ashley\u2019s antics, watching the dragon more, \"Come on dragon, hurry up and eat her so we can kill you. Come on, it isn't that hard.\"\u00a0He bounces his sword against his shoulder impatiently. He was ready to fight the dragon and Andraste stood in the way. The candy wielding, bear killing, goof of a warrior, wasn\u2019t scared in the least bit of Gravlor.\u00a0Off to the distance, the skunk watched Gravlor. He still had his bow aimed at the dragon\u2019s  eye. He knew he would only have so many chances to make his shot.\u00a0The skunkman would shout to the dragon, his words falling on dear ears, \"Who are you and why have you come here??\"\u00a0One of the soldiers that got scooped up by the dragon shouted angrily and tried to sink a blade into the dragon. In that second, the dragon had clamped down to end the soldiers life and make him the drop the sword. A worthy try, but not quick enough to save his life.\u00a0The rest of the Aaedian\u2019s reformed around Andraste as they would any mage. They did not attack, allowing the mage to sooth the beast. Their force was a man down but other than minor wounds, they wear unharmed. \u00a0One soldier headed to Levi standing beside him and not taking his eye off the dragon. \"Praetor, orders?\"\u00a0Gravlor was not satisfied with Andraste\u2019s answer. He had told her what he desired and what it would cost if she didn't. Her words meant nothing to him, as Trogdor's Anger blinded him.\u00a0Gravlor slammed his massive tail into the ground while raising his front right arm/leg to slam it down infront of Andraste. During all this he would open his mouth, roaring in Andraste's face. \u00a0As he roared, Andraste would be able to fool the raw energy that escaped in his tone. Despite being angered, the power of his spirit, Love, could be felt. Even Andraste knows that the power of Love, infected by hatred and revenge, was one of the most deadly combinations on energy, pulling from both sides of the spectrum.\u00a0Gravlor would flap his wings twice, lifting into the air, \"Now you all shall suffer!\"\u00a0Within seconds of rising into the sky, he was aleeady gathering energy in his mouth to release a blast. As the blast gained full power, Gravlor would release the blast. \u00a0At such a range, he would leave multiple ditches in the ground and the air full of dust, dirt, and debris. He had no intention of harming Andraste for the time being. \u00a0As quick as Gravlor destroyed the area, he was gone into the sky. He left nothing standing in the area except the beings who had just arrived. He would return here again one day to finish the job, but for now he felt as though Mother Gaia would cry enough here. It was time to bring her pain in another settlement.\u00a0Andraste would shield her eyes from the blast of hot air that rolled from the Dragon's maw. She would stand her ground, even as the earth around her explodes with the dragon's breath. She was not weak, but what else could you do when a dragon could snap you in two in less than second?\u00a0After the beast departs, Andraste would take a knee and sigh. She had used up most of her remaining energy trying to calm the Gravlor of the curse, Trogodor\u2019s Anger. Her respite is only momentary, however, as after a few moments she raises to her feet and walks over to where the soldiers of Aaedan had fallen. \u00a0She would blast the brainwashed jays off them with minor bolts of electricity. She goes to each fallen soldiers one at a time and kneels by their side. She\u2019d  place a hand over their heart and her lips upon theirs, light spilling from her mouth and into theirs. The effects of this lights would cause a glow that trickles slowly down to the center of their chest and grows in intensity until it abruptly stops. \u00a0She performs this ritual many times over, resurrecting ten of the less mangled soldiers before collapsing upon the ground. While those she revives are still in need of healing for their external wounds, at least, for now, their bodies were alive again.\u00a0Andraste looked weaker than ever, however. Bringing life back to the lifeless whilst also restoring the soul is one of the most difficult spells to master. It is extremely taxing, and she still hasn't eaten. It would seem, for now, that she's out of commission. Her eyes would shut and her breathing slowed to a near silent wisp, ponderous gasp.\u00a0\"Fuck! Move!\" Levi shouted as he dove into the nearest Aedian soldier to move him out of the way and save him from the blast.\u00a0When Levi got back up and he prepares to retaliate. As soon as he was ready he noticed that the dragon had escaped. Seeing the beast go would only fuel his desire to see it beaten.\u00a0Renalt was disappointed at the vanishing dragon, \u201cAww...it got away.\"\u00a0He groans, and turns back to Billy, Ashley, and Kate, \"Sorry folks. Come now, let's go back to the shop so we can discuss what went wrong here.\u201d \u00a0\u201cEr...what was your name, ma\u2019am?\u201d,He asks Kate, still unknown to who she is.\u00a0\"We\u2019re actually doing this?\" Kate muttered as she looked around the rampaged area, realizing how much Gravlor ripped it apart so easily in it\u2019s wrath. \u00a0\"Ooh, this would make a great potato field... I mean, Uhh I'm Kate, hi!\", She joked trying to raise spirits in the situation before responding to Renalt.\u00a0Kate looked over to Andaste, lying on the ground, \"Looks like she could use sum sugar, though...\"\u00a0\"Fuck that,\" Billy yells, throwing his bow over his shoulder and the bag over the other, \"The hunt is fucking on! Lets get after that thing! Where's a horse?\"\u00a0The skunk puts the bow and arrow away, ashamed he didn\u2019t take the shot when he had the chance. Without hesitation, he got up and looked around at the destruction caused by the beast.\u00a0\"well... that could\u2019ve turned out worse...\" He thought to himself.\u00a0\"That's the spirit, sonny! Let's go!\", With his expression changing from disappointment as he spoke, Renalt would draw his sword out again and waves it in the air, \"Let's find some horses, we gotta follow that dragon!\"\u00a0Renalt ran over to where some horses were tied up and cuts through the ropes holding them. He then begin luring them away with chocolates. Horses have always liked him, since he carried so much sugar on him all the times.\u00a0Levi ran over to where Andraste had fallen, \"Hey lady! Hey, are you okay?\"\u00a0The middle-aged wizard would check is she was still alive. He\u2019d quickly take notice to how weak Andraste was at the time and decides to lift her up and carry her to help if need be, where she can get help. \u00a0\"Hold on, I'll take you back to the Citadel.\", he whispered to Andraste.\u00a0Andraste was in no position to argue with Levi. In fact, she was hardly conscious enough to realize that she was being moved. So, she simply lied in his arms, limp and dead to the world.\u00a0Back in the group, Billy took a moment to make an impromptu shoulder strap for the \"crossbow\". He hooked up the rucksack on a saddle, and straddled his beast. He was ready to go and get this dragon.\u00a0\"Let's ride!\" He shouted, patience working against the elf.\u00a0\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u00a0Surprise Ending after Credits\u2026..\u00a0Suddenly, on the road upon which the dragon hunters were travelling, an inroad came up on their right. From this road came a heavily armed and armored woman with shoulder-length snow white hair whipping about her face on a black courser galloping full tilt in the same direction as the party. It seemed as if for a moment she was going to collide with Billy's horse. That was until she took a  sharp turn, kicking dirt and gravel at their beasts legs. She would flaunt her riding skills while taking to the same road in the same direction as the others. \u00a0She would slow her beast down, moving back to the group once she was done, shouting over the galloping hooves, \"Are you hunting that dragon too?\"\u00a0Her voice was low, strong, and yet still carried feminine essence. She didn\u2019t seem to notice the familiar face riding beside Billy. Raena was more focused on the hunt than the people here. They were either a roadbump or an asset, and she was in a hurry. \u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://img05.deviantart.net/6e22/i/2015/127/5/d/yugioh_2016_movie___blue_eyes_white_dragon_by_slifertheskydragon-d8skhmh.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://img05.deviantart.net/6e22/i/2015/127/5/d/yugioh_2016_movie___blue_eyes_white_dragon_by_slifertheskydragon-d8skhmh.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/></div>"}}
