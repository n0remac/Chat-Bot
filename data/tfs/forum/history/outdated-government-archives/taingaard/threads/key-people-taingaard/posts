{"post-84023": {"user": "Taingaard", "user_num": 3105, "timestamp": "1531759409000", "message": "Who has the power in Taingaard?In Taingaard the power to rule the other Tains is given to the Tain of Vikhafen, although the other Tains of Skulh\u00f8y and Leifheim are only very rarely asked to comply with a new law, and to this extend the different regions are essentially self-governed. And though the various Tains of Taingaard have the definite military power of the nation, there are factions which they have no interest in or downright cannot rule.\u00a0One such faction is the Gr\u00f6nskog druids, who are of different descent than the other Taingaardians and live largely secluded in Gr\u00f6nskog. 'Anyone foolish enough to go in there and get on the druids bad side are not worth being bothered with' is the general attitude here.\u00a0VikhafenVikhafen is ruled by Tain Erik Haldar, who's family have been governing Taingaard for quite some years now. His daughter Freya Haldar is next in line, although it seems not like the Tain has any intention of standing down this decade or the next. Erik is a busy man though and you'll more often find him in the stables, out hunting and inspecting the soldiers than sitting on his throne. Thus he can be a difficult man to reach - and if you happen to being allowed to see him you better well have something important and not be wasting his time. He's a proud man and quick to act - and anger - although if someone wins his trust they may have it for life.\u00a0LeifheimIn Leifheim rules only the word of Tain Sigrid Torinnsdottir - quite literally. Although considered fair and responsible, the provisional Tain Torinnsdottir have proved to be quite adept at keeping her position despite quite a few other clans with far more reputable families have been knocking on the door. Sigrid is respected because she seeks to treat people equally whenever possible, though some would say that her ancestry which includes witches and shamans of 'grey' alignment have not been broken and might act stronger through her voice than people are willing to confront her with openly. However losing have always had a bitter taste to it, and the common adventurer shouldn't think twice of approaching her and she will help and assist whenever she can.\u00a0Skulh\u00f8yThe partially underground city of Skulh\u00f8y have had Tain Larnon Skulfir as a ruler for only a couple of years, but in that time he has dedicated his time to increasing the efforts of the mining, forging and expanding to the north quite significantly. The young Tain is the first of the original Skul-family to ascend to regent for many generations and thus seeks to prove his ambitions. Any adventurer with the guts and courage might find a dangerous - but definitely prosperous - job by approaching Larnon Skulfir to offer assistance. As a tain he's quick to see opportunities and acts unceremoniously at most times.\u00a0Gr\u00f6nskogThe Gr\u00f6nskog druids may be a relatively small faction judged by area, but their druids are often spotted long away from their home and is gathering knowledge and protecting nature all over Taingaard, thus having a larger influence than you may initially expect from a secluded bunch like the Gr\u00f6nskog Druids. Among the Taingaardians there have been rumours about the King of Gr\u00f6nskog, an ancient and powerful druid, though no druid from there have ever confirmed this - although they have not denied it either. Best not to ask them too firmly as they seem awfully annoyed whenever the question pops up.\u00a0\u00a0SvarthafenA place most Taingaardians would rather forget and where highwaymen, thieves and the dishonorable are said to live. Thus little info is known about this place and it's true rule has yet to be discovered, though the Vikhafen soldiers have sometimes snatched up bits of information of the \"Black Tain\". Adventurers are strongly discouraged to go there, and you might even be considered a traitor to Taingaard if you speak too loudly about the place. However \"Svarthafen\" is a legit swear word in Taingaard, and \"Go to Svarthafen you son of an ox!\" is good reply if your gambling luck is failing you in the late hours in the local Mead Hall.\u00a0", "link_list": ["https://flic.kr/p/M4HGHb", "https://flic.kr/p/M4HGHb", "https://www.flickr.com/photos/137813549@N06/", "https://flic.kr/p/KvWVPV", "https://flic.kr/p/KvWVPV", "https://www.flickr.com/photos/137813549@N06/", "https://flic.kr/p/M4JaH3", "https://flic.kr/p/M4JaH3", "https://www.flickr.com/photos/137813549@N06/", "https://flic.kr/p/298dPsJ", "https://flic.kr/p/298dPsJ", "https://www.flickr.com/photos/137813549@N06/"], "image_list": ["https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1766/29578140588_982e94303f_n.jpg", "https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1761/28562236527_a74774ca47_n.jpg", "https://farm1.staticflickr.com/837/29578231408_d043eb843a_n.jpg", "https://farm1.staticflickr.com/843/43401263162_8f55f2af79_o.jpg"], "html": "<b><font size=\"6\">Who has the power in Taingaard?</font></b>"}}
