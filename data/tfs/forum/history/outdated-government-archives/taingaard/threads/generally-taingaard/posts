Shamans, druids and proud warriors blend with traders, adventurers and the common folk to populate the country which was once conquered when the vile beasts were driven out. Today Taingaard bids welcome anyone who calls themselves friend and most people would love to hear and tell tales over a pint and a stew, and won't be scared to venture out and see the tale is true. It is the land mythical creatures, fair and brave people and an even fairer land. The people who live in Taingaard enjoy long lives and the land grant them an abundance of game, fruits and berries.  Honour, bravery and a true heart will get you long in Taingaard, and you will find that most people are uncomplicated and easygoing if they regard you as a friend. Magic is an intricate part of the country, and especially rune magic, which have the druids of Taingaard have studied, is prevalent. You will find that runes often are used to enhance the properties of armor and weapons, but Taingaard is abundant with other kinds of strange and odd magic in various forms and shapes. Shape shifting is also popular among druids and alchemy is practiced by the secluded Gr\u00f6nskog Druids. Taingaard may be settled by humans, but it's wild nature is not in any way tamed by them - and that is the way the Taingaardian humans here would want it. The gods gave them the land in a past long gone, and the Taingaardian honor this gift to this day by living with respect for the nature and revering the wonders it create. The Taingaardian humans are just as much traders and adventurers as they are warriors. The love exploring new places and gaining knowledge and insight is deeply rooted within them and few could resist the urge of making a new friend from another country - be it drinking buddy, rival or both. To that extend they have become adept ship builders and sailors, and their long boats are able to endure longer distances and harsher than one would think possible given their sizes. Government is rather straight forward. The three main cities of Vikhafen, Leifheim and Skulh\u00f8y each have their own Tain - you may recognize it from the word 'captain' - which governs their own city. However in Vikhafen rules the Tain of Erik Haldar, who oversees the land and it's protection and political interests. He is - with the unspoken consent of the other Tain - the ruler of Taingaard. However he does not use this to enforce rules upon the other cities and Tain's under normal circumstances. The seasons in Taingaard all present their own challenges and are often spectacular in their differences. While the winter almost always yields snow, spring reveals some of the most amazing sceneries when everything starts to blossom. In the summer honey flows from the land and the fertility of Taingaard is apparent for all to see, while autumn is a pure amber spectacle when the leaves fall. Everything about this land seem in some way enchanted, and even in its harshness and brutality there lies beauty to behold, and as the Taingaardian often say: \"The gods have yet seized to create\"And you would only need to spend a brief time in Taingaard to acknowledge this as truth. However the rolling hills, lakes and mountains that adorn the land does not mean that you should travel far from the roads lightly. Werewolves, witches of darker times, sirens, highwaymen, trolls and sea snakes are all among the dangers that lurk - but where there is danger, rewards usually follows. And if you're in need of a travelling companion, you'll hardly need to look further than to the nearest inn!", "link_list": ["https://flic.kr/p/29GWss5", "https://flic.kr/p/29GWss5", "https://www.flickr.com/photos/137813549@N06/"], "image_list": ["https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1831/43782831552_daee93acc9_o.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/29GWss5\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1831/43782831552_daee93acc9_o.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/></a><a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/29GWss5\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/137813549@N06/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div>"}}
