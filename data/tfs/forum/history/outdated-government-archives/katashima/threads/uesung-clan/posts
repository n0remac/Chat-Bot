and his entire family - was massacred.\u00a0 Their castle was left to ruin, their fields and villages left to burn.\u00a0 The Uesung Province remained nothing but a burnt wasteland of hopelessness.It seemed that not all the Uesung died on that day.\u00a0 Kagen's youngest son, Kenjin Uesung, was secretly transported to the Isle of Bishonton by his father's retinue, who also returned the Tachi no Akuma.\u00a0 There, the warrior-monks adopted the young boy and trained him for many years in the art of combat, warfare, literature, and music.\u00a0 He became a greater warrior than any of the Uesung which came before him, and withheld knowledge of the arts and mind.\u00a0 Upong his completion, Kenjin was rewarded the Tachi no Akuma.\u00a0 Kenjin returned to Katashima with the legendary blade his forefathers possessed, where he seeks to rebuild the Uesung clan and restore their lost honor.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><i><u><b>Brief History</b></u><br/></i></div>"}, "post-19456": {"user": "The Uesung Clan", "user_num": 953, "timestamp": "1450793985000", "message": "Known Members of the ClanBatu Uesung -
