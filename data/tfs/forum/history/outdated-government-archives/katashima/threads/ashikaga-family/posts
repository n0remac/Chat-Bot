During peace time, the ashigaru serve as peasant rice farmers and train irregularly to maintain a level of competency in yarijutsu. Approximately 100 samurai serve the Ashikaga family, some blood relatives while others owe fealty to Ashikaga Masaru. The Ashikaga is a vassal family in service to the Hizashi family, the ruling family whom govern the Toku province. The provincial daimyo Hizashi Genji is the current reigning daimyo whom the Ashikaga serve. As bannermen in service to the Hizashi, the Ashikaga owe fealty to Lord Genji. In exchange of their fealty, they govern a small fief of land within the Toku province where they govern from their ancestral seat of power Ashikaga Castle. In times of war the Ashikaga bring their fighting strength to Lord Genji. The Ashikaga is a small vassal family so do not possess the political clout of greater families. However, as samurai they still possess their own set of traditions and number of allies throughout Katashima. The fief they govern is known for the textiles produced which are famous for the beautiful indigo dyes they utilize. Additionally, a well known iai dojo is located within the fief that trains the loyal Ashikaga family samurai. Their lands run along the Kakita River, a waterway that runs through the mountains of the Toku province.Ashikaga Castle", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://pingmag.jp/images/article/animal-kamon-design10.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Kokura_castle_from_the_Japanese_garden.jpg"], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><b><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://pingmag.jp/images/article/animal-kamon-design10.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/></b><br/></div>"}}
