If everyone likes one another it makes for a boring story. However, I can imagine there are some progressive factions in Katashima who are more welcoming to gaijin influences. I cannot speak for anyone's outlooks beyond my own characters.As a half-blood Katashiman, Riku would be interested in foreigners.Morimoto Osawa is zealous in his hatred of foreigners.Ashikaga Isao is very traditional, but willing to open up diplomatic relations if it benefits Katashima.
