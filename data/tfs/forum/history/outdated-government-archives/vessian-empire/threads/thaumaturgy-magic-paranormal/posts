The best case scenario for discovered magic users is imprisonment or exile, and for children a quick and hasty internment with the Church or other approved organizations where they can brainwash the child into serving their purposes. The worst case scenario -- and the one most often found throughout the empire -- is death, usually by burning as fire as seen as purifying, but sometimes in more brutal ways.Not all magic is prohibited, however. The Clergy and Church are known to use magic, usually for healing. The Inquisitors have also been known to use spells to \"discover\" or \"reveal\" the truth, and even some well-respected members of the upper class are allowed to use magic if under the watchful eye of others, but these individual are very rare and are often shrouded in scandal and distrust.There are the occasional \u201cmagi-Vessians,\u201d people born with massive magical power, not to speak of their even greater potential in every sort of magic at once. If not born into the nobility (which is rare due to the much smaller blessings upon the population) they are taken away from their families and taught about how to use their powers, which is generally accepted by the family who will be fearful of this overwhelmingly powerful child.The safest way for a person of magic to live in the Vessian Empire, and of whom doesn't want to serve the ultra-regimented Clergy, Inquisitors, or Witch Hunters, would be to either never use magic, ever, or to leave Vessia for the thick forests of Swavia to the West.In the thick forests that border Swavia and beyond, magic is more \"welcomed\" if it ascribes to a certain type. Blood magic, necromancy, and the Dark Arts are always hated for their connotations with evil and harm-doing. The Barbarians of the Swavian Forests have magic that borders on shamanism, with some clans even able to turn into werebeasts. The Fae, Dwarves, Werewolves, Vampires, and the like have escaped into Swavia or elsewhere, but due to the rare nature of magic at all, they are not rampant.TL;DRMagic and magical creatures are feared and persecuted within Vessia, if not by the populace, then by organizations like the Church, the Inquisition, or the Witch Hunters.Some magic is learned and used within the approved organization of the Church, Inquisition, and Witch Hunters.Magic-users of the upper class are rare, and sometimes allowed a 'pass', but even then they are usually pariahs of society.
