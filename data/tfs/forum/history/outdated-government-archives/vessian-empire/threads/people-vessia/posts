The upper class holds all the power; money, weapons, food. While the lower-class is kept educated this is only so that they would be better sources for income to their rulers. Of course their rulers are aware that an educated populace is more prone to self-determination, so they make sure that great respect for the government and affiliated institutions is maintained and instilled from an early age. Additionally, very strict laws, rules and social norms are developed that are difficult to circumvent even for the nobility. Of course, bureaucracy, greed and great dissent within the government makes sure that there are many silly and rather stupid laws needlessly restricting one's freedoms.  However, there is method to this madness; it makes it clear to the citizens that they are property. Taxes are made great to let the citizens only have enough to feed themselves. Anything more is seen as a threat to national security for then they can arm and prepare themselves for war. There is limited unspoken social contract of niceties and such between the elite and the people. Noblesse Oblige ensures that the occasional lucky serf receives some silk clothing and nobles make sure not to earn too much ire from their people; after all they are the ones they will need support from in case of war, or the nobles want to secede from the Empire. It is always ensured that via blessings and enhancements the elite always have an advantage over the commoners, no matter how outnumbered. \u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/gLnANZI.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">\u00a0 \u00a0 The people of Vessia are split directly into upper and lower class, with a middle class practically non-existent.
