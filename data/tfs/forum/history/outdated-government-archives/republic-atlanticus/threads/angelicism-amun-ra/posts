Rejoice! For your faith has been true and strong through my flaws!1:7On clouds I now stand, but in the air around you, I am present.4:53I will carry you through the Depths of Hell, the Tide of the Waters, the Mountains of Gaia, and the Cities of Man to the Gates of Heaven!\u00a08:17Understand that I am always with you. Do not lose faith, for in your darkest moments I will cast my Light, and together we will grow to flourish as the Phoenix.22:23Give me your faith and I will provide you strength and wisdom to endure so that together we can serve the Lord, our God. The God that chose our Faith as a Fire of Heaven!Book of Judgement1:5Cast down your faith and serve I, for no false idol can save you now. My blade is upon your throat, but my merciful hand is upon your cheek, accept My Will and Salvation will be upon you.3:38You are sword and shield, I am the strength. Fret not, for my hand will not kill the innocent; evil judged in each swing. Even in the moment of death will My Mercy offer paradise to the wicked; for the soul is the final representation of their final faith in their last moment.67:1And the Paladin of Amun Ra will stand before their cities and commands thy enemy, \"Convert or die. The Angel of Amun Ra is among you and has come to offer Salvation from thy struggles and life in an eternal paradise! Those who have souls that wonder, come forth and your lives shall be sparred. Those who deny shall be judged by the Almighty and your blade his decision. Convert or die my fellow mortals!\"77:45Under my Will, those who deny our faith and commit horrid sin, shall be judged with death. Their cities shall be purged from existence and their people forgotten. Blessed are those who believe in Me, forgotten are those who deny Me. Carry this judgement with you in all the land and forsake not this command.As one can tell, their religion is simple. Do the right thing and embrace the Angel of Amun Ra with all your heart. If you don't, death is certain follow. Those that do convert do tend to have much better lives than before so they keep quiet and enjoy their new lives. Those that denied them were killed and their removed off the map. There is no grey zone in their belief, there is good and evil, believers and pagans, life or death. Generally only the Book of Blessed is used, as the Book of Judgement are the Chapters of War for Crusades. The Book of the Blessed has a Creation based beginning and has many chapters from ancient kings in The Phoenix State, Norkari, and kingdom previous to Medan before the Cataclysm. There was very little negativity in the Book of the Blessed, talking about what good comes out of strong Faith in the Angel of Amun Ra.The Book of Judgement is all about war, plague, and religious horrors. It is the justification to the measures that the Atlantian Order of the Sword takes to carry out the will of the Angel of Amun Ra. It doesn't much apply to the believing side of the Angelic belief, but it is what the Priests and Poul cite when in enemy or foreign lands to strike horror in them and convince them to convert.Poul(Pope)Position AvailablePoul's Hand(Warlord of the Poul)Komtur Giplor Vauc' Tutt of OzomdiasArch Mages of the Angel(Two mages who act as Prophets for the Angel of Amun Ra)Position AvailablePriests/Priestess(Runs churches throughout the Overwold.
