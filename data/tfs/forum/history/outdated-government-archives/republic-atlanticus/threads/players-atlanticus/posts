The Eye of Amun Ra, as it was called, was not unusual to her bloodline, a bloodline that was ancient and royal in the mysterious Bedouin tribes of the Great Desert.Unfortunately, her tribe, the Ma'hati, were dying out and dwindling, until all that remained was Neferet herself and the guardian who had been sworn to her, Akbar. Wise beyond her years and elegant in her relations with people, she found a place for herself in Gaiaton, a city that was struggling with the changes brought on by the Republic of Atlanticus and its forefather, the Phoenix State.Familiar with the Phoenix State, and seen as Divine by the people of Gaiaton for the Eye of Amun Ra, Neferet ascended to Leadership of Gaiaton with relative ease. The people seem to adore Neferet, and understanding her ability, none are offended with her need for personal distance.Under Neferet's guidance, Gaiaton has smoothly come to the newer age, and their production of silk, dyes, exotic foods and furs has doubled while still maintaining the balance with the Living Jungle that surrounds them.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/oA8ExSc.jpg"], "html": "NAME | Neferet Ankh-Shapsut"}, "post-15739": {"user": "Robert Fletcher", "user_num": 509, "timestamp": "1447460161000", "message": "Name: Robert Fletcher\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gender: MaleRace: FletcherPosition/Rank: Mayor of OzmodiasCity/Location: OzmodiasRobert (Or Robby, as Ruby, Royal, and uncle Renalt call him), comes from the rich branch of the Fletcher family.

Nobody is quite sure how the hell he became mayor of Carmela. Nobody can deny he fits the spirit of the island of course. Wild debauchery is his natural state and it is common on the island of pleasure. Unfortunately he is completely unsuited to the actual work side of the position of mayor. Luckily his secretary Beatrice handles the day to day paperwork. Unfortunately for Beatrice the majority of the paper work she handles is formal complaints against the mayor. The people of Carmela however put up with the mayor mostly because he handles the odd sea monster attack through liberal use of punching.

He served six years 'Cleansing' the land now known as Atlanticus. When he reached the age of twenty, the knight he served under dubbed him a knight under the Aros Legion flag. After cleansing the land it was at least two years before any real colonies were set up in Atlanticus. The Phoenix State was doing what was necessary to sustain it's military presence in the world it touches. Giplor had taken on a freelancing knight role during these two years to build his reputation. Within a month of travels, Giplor had found a brotherhood of knights known as the Brothers of the Sword. He would take them to Atlanticus and \u00a0show them what had been done. During the travels in Atlanticus, these brothers had converted Giplor Vauc'Tutt to their religion. The conversion lead to a religious campaign. Giplor was well known among the people as he had fought for this land since day one under Esphireses. While others marched on, Giplor was left with a handful of men to eradicated what could have been into the thousands of dark creatures. The soldiers never speak of what they had done, for if they did, it would be treason. This lead them to look for justification and the Angelic belief provided it. These forts and soldiers began to band together under a new flag, the Atlantian Flag. It was exactly what The Phoenix State wanted. They did not fight it. The religion was quite fascinating and the people took well to it, even the government. In turn, The Phoenix State funded the growth, even to build a cathedral in what would become the Angelic Estate of Atlanticus. The Brothers of the Sword saw what good Giplor had done in the region and what he would do to bring peace, they accepted him as a Brother of the Sword. With his works here, they returned to their home, leaving Giplor as Komtur Giplor Vauc'Tutt. With support from the Brothers of the Sword and The Phoenix State, Giplor became the linchpin to the foundation of Atlanticus. By the end of the two years, Giplor was a Governor and a Paladin. The construction of homes and first real, non militant, people began to arrive. Giplor made sure to put focus on three regions to begin with. They had been the most valuable pieces in all the land; Ozmodias, Gaiton, and Esphiridon.He is now a Grand Komtur within the Brotherhood, leading the Atlantican Angelic Order, he is the Poul's Hand, the Holy Sword of the Angel of Amun-Ra, Governor of Atlanticus, and private owner of Vauc'Tutt n' Butts. Needless to say, he is a very busy man. \u00a0(Bare with me, we have to change a few features.)Hair: BrownEyes: BlueUnderarmor garbs: BlueArmor:White with blue outlinesWeapons: Common sword - Atlantian Judgement: (Sword in the Teutonic Knight's hand.)Forged of and enchanted by Brock of the Black Lion Tribe. The sword was about three feet long and less than a fifth of an inch thick at any point. The enchanted gives it Iron Strength and Slight of Hand bonuses on this sword. To sum it up, it was thin, strong as iron, and light as a feather to the user. There is nothing that binds this sword to one player, it just responds better to Holy Magic and Light Magic.Paladin Sword - The Atlantium Storm: This sword washed up on shore at Giplor's feet one day when patrolling the shores. When he touched the sword it bonded to him. When his hand grabbed the hilt, it vanished. The next time he seen this sword was when he became a Brother and wore the Teutonic style armor. From that point on, it remained. He only uses this sword when needed, as he views it more of a weapon of mass destruction that should only be used in special occasions.This sword is a sword that is six feet in length. It reaches one and a half inches at it's thickest point. The sword had a triangular tip on it. Do not be fooled, this \u00a0broadsword is very capable in Giplor's hand in a cqc battle.\u00a0Shield: Giplor Wall - (Shield in picture) Notoriously being known as Giplor Wall because seems to be near impossible to get over, under, or around it. The shield is Blessed with a Holy Enchantment. The Blessing lightens it by 1/5 it's weight and defends against Dark Magic and Fire Magic with confidence. This is his only shield.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/5c/a7/18/5ca7189cff670f87e41b6bdd5c176af8.jpg", "http://img-cache.cdn.gaiaonline.com/b97e3b0a12bc67c369868ebb6fba5afc/http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y43/Lord_Gaylon/People/FFXII_Basch_End.jpg", "http://img-cache.cdn.gaiaonline.com/3d0e901882fc18069ce738c09a19993e/http://i237.photobucket.com/albums/ff6/_Kiba-Wolf_/icesword3.jpg"], "html": "<b>Name</b>"}}
