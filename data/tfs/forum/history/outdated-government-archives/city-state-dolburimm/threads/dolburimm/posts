It's home to a race of seafaring dwarves who live and die on the waves. For hundreds of years they have lived off the bounty of the sea and have become accomplished boat builders. With stocky frames and limited access to precious metals the populace of Dolburimm have adopted a more refined take on combat, focusing on ranged combat both on and off land.\u00a0The city itself is sheltered in a large cliff side cove which offers limited protection from the harsh weather that plagues the land.

Surrounding the city is a dense and thick forest, one wrought with many fantastical and deadly creatures. As venturing into the thicket is a dangerous gambit wood is a rarity in the city with the locals utilizing driftwood where they can and building structures with a multitude of different stones. As such Dolburimm has a very weathered feel to it. The large array of uniform drab stone buildings have been worn away by the constant rainfall and the unstoppable force of the waves, giving the city a weathered and miserable feel to it.\u00a0The docks of Dolburimm are filled with dwarves busy with all the tasks befitting of a maritime nation.

The stench of fish lingers in the air as haul after haul are unloaded from the finely crafted ships and packed in ice should the weather permit it.

Whalebone is one of the most common media in which to craft sharpened knives and harpoons while seal and walrus bones are used if the latter is in short supply. The Dolburese favoured the bow very early in their heritage slowly building a natural affinity to range combat.

These leaders pass down the torch to another in their family when they feel that can no longer rule due to either age or willingness. Sometimes a Thane dies before they can announce a successor. This is a rare occasion but when it does happen it often throws a family to the brink of civil war with various factions from within a household emerging to claim their seat as a ruler.

They watch over Dolburimm in the darkness of night and are said to fight back the evil spirits of the night, keeping them at bay long enough for the sun to rise each morning. The brothers are the patron deities of battle, protection and the night in the Dolburimm pantheon.Einwyn - This female deity is charged with filling the oceans with all manner of life and is often called the mother of the bounty. Many of the Dolburese worship Einwyn on a daily basis to ask that their hauls are bountiful and plenty. She is the wife of\u00a0Hulrik and mother to Bunrigg and Malnir.Balren - As the god of gods and the king of the Dolburese pantheon Malnir has many names; The Allfather, Master of the Waves and Bringer of the Tides. It is said that Malnir carved out the cove in which Dolburimm is built with a single strike from his trident then defending the cove for a hundred years from the Great Kraken\u00a0Tysri who commanded an army of malicious sea creatures. In the end Malnir was victorious and return to the sea to ensure that Tysri and her hordes could not harm any of his people.

It is believed that he created the horrors which currently live in the darkness of the forest and greedily stole the gift of wood from the other gods. Tormand is Balren's brother and is widely believed to have been banished to the forests beyond Dolburimm for trying to kill his brother over the maiden Einwyn.Tysri - Tysri is a giant kraken who tried to kill Malnir after he carved the cove in which Dolburimm is built. He is locked in an eternal war with Malnir deep beneath the ocean. Tysri is said to have created many of the terrifying monsters which often plague the bountiful seas surrounding the city.", "link_list": ["/user/1411", "/user/566", "/user/1409"], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/BA9FYj1.png", "http://img13.deviantart.net/d356/i/2012/181/4/1/the_city_of_shakar_by_noahbradley-d55frpt.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/BA9FYj1.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/><br><font size=\"5\" style=\"font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">The City State of Dolburimm<br/><br/></font><b>Current Members</b><br/><span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-1411 group-0\" href=\"/user/1411\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@dolburimm\"><span itemprop=\"name\">The People of Dolburimm</span></a></span> <br/>@medsy      <br/>    @gurnum    <br/><span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-566 group-0\" href=\"/user/566\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@izumi\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Izumi Kita</span></a></span> <br/> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-1409 group-0\" href=\"/user/1409\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@nalric\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Nalric TempestDawn</span></a></span> <br/>   @dardan<br/><br/>Dolburimm is a city nestled along the western coast of the main continent.

Recruitment is open for two more Thanes who will have leading roles with the City. Thanes will have to be Dolburese nationals so you will most likely need to make a new character to fit the role.

Also looking for any type of character who wished to make Dolburimm their home. I'm more than willing to facilitate RP for all those who want something to do, just want to visit or want to interact with the Dolburese leadership.
