The Haitaka family line that has held the title of \u2018Warlord\u2019 rules over every aspect of his territory, protecting his people from raiders and ensuring their prosperity to serve him. For five generations, the Haitaka family has fought in their own ways to try and keep the Fusei and Chi no Tora away from their people - and the fight continues to this day.The common people - farmers, craftsmen, workers, merchants - simply seek a peaceful existence where there is little worry of being raided or captured or killed by those under the red banner. Any with expansive farms try to remain as close to Yueqiu or Napo as possible - as there is safety within the city\u2019s walls or near the monk temple. They work day in and day out for their livelihood, and mutually serve the Shogun in exchange for his protection.Soldiers answer to their samurai commanders - impeccable swordsmen of refined skill and ability, some of which are apprentices of Shichiro-sensei who trained each and every heir of the Haitaka Shogunate including young Takehiko. And all answer ultimately to the Shogun himself and his court.The monks of Napo are serene individuals under Grandmaster Daisuke that learn to heal and mend and forgive and charity and understanding before they are taught to fight and defend. It makes them powerful protectors of the people, hence why their main temple is within Napo and they oversee the people of the town instead of posted soldiers generally. However, they are well versed in martial arts before weapons, and even then will disarm and disable a fighter before attempting to harm. Their order is diligent and strict, but it is to be as a peaceful approach is certainly more trying and demanding of patience compared to that of a warmonger.The Shogun Shadows are mysterious beings that are generally shied away from by those unfamiliar with them, or that have heard any number of rumors. These are special, deemed elite warriors under the Haitaka line as masters of intelligence, espionage and assassination. Granted this is not where their abilities stop, but it was the initial purpose when Master Hideaki was appointed upon his arrival. These warriors are hardly seen outside their shaded basement beneath the palace except upon orders for a task or to speak to the Shogun. Their shadows generally warrant ill feelings, as with it usually comes with death or worse.The vicious men and women of the red banner know no bounds. They take what they want, kill for fun and pleasure, and answer only to their appointed commanders and all answer to the Bloody Tiger. The crimes of any one individual are hardly ever fewer than two, and cruel in nature. They maim and kill. They pillage and destroy. They molest and enslave. Nothing is beneath them, and everything is within their sights - more so the lands under the blue banner. They want their territory back. The Tiger wants his lands back.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/ZSOXUQw.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/dx8k1ms.png"], "html": "<font face=\"georgia\"><br>Within the lawlessness of Dongshu, there stands a beacon of order under the rule of the Shogun - within the claimed Lands of Heaven.

The setting is a healthy mix of orients, a little heavier on medieval Japan in style. Some of the setting is a reflection of Tawakoshi, as Dongshu was born of the larger nation long, long ago. But nothing is concrete on following a particular style or setting down to the letter, so tweaking is always a thing!There is always demand for farmers, craftsmen, inn and shop and restaurant keepers. With the constant threat of the Fusei bandits and raiders, warriors and soldiers are always a must. Individuals of the upper nobility class are welcome - I mean, who doesn't want honor, class and money? They reside in the Aristocratic Quarter. The common man is in the Common Quarter, and they are always in variety. Of course, this isn't the sole limit to what can be made - be creative!   ... don't ask why they're labeled \"quarters\" when they aren't quarter sections of the city - that was the first Haitaka's brilliance. Somehow.  Of course, there's the other side of the law. If you so desire. Though, in all fairness, the Fusei are in constant war and battle with the Shogun and his people - always fighting for control of the island. And no matter what side you rather choose, there's a really good chance of battle. And possibly death... more so on the Fusei side. But it's always an option if you feel so bold!There's the other side of the scale, though, too! Yokai and oni and kami spirits are a thing~ Usually encounters of this nature are prompted by the nation account to help promote RP but if you wanna make one, go for it! But be aware - monks and priests and especially sorcerers deal with these creatures as part of their job! Might be good ways, might be bad - yanno, depends on what said creature is doing. But these guys do interact with these spirits more so than the common man might!And if you have any questions, feel free to PM either Dongshu account - we'll be happy to help anyway we can!
