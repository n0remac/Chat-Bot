So I figured it would be a good idea to, at least, make a note for those that want a little more clarity:The NPCs listed and appearing within threads in Dongshu are not set in stone! They are merely placeholders to allow for some life within the place until players opt to take those positions! I had it in my mind that, for those looking to come into Dongshu (via travel or making a character), they would need some sort of interaction. Some response from the world to give life and RP opportunities to those that arrive. It is why I created all the NPC characters that I have - simply to provide that until others seek to take them instead!So if you desire a certain role, by all means say so! Ask! I would be more than ecstatic to rewrite any lore and replace NPCs with a character you want. It's not that hard to retire an NPC for a player!   Also, if there are any questions in general regarding Dongshu in any way, shape or form - PM me! PM my discord(Darkana#6443)! Or you can ask it here, and the answers can become available to other readers after you!
