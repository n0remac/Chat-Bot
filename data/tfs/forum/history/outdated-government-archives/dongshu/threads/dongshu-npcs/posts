It has a history steeped in bloodshed, with only a small section of freshly written pages not completely colored red. The inhabitants of the island are roughly divided into two groups - those of a peaceful, prosperous group beneath the Shogunate of Yueqiu and those that rally behind the banner of the cruel, greedy and ruthless Bloody Tiger; Chi no ToraYueqiuShogun Takehiko of the Haitaka                - the Lord and Shogun of Yueqiu. His father was struck down when he was a young man, and so the burden of leadership fell to him at a very young age in his twenties. However, he retains the council that had been created to give advice and assist the Shogun - and also occasionally seeks the counsel of his uncle and his nephewLady EtsukoHaitaka's first wifeage 28Lady AyaneHaitaka's second wifeage 15Haruto HaitakaTakehiko's Nephewage 17Yurei HaitakaTakehiko's Uncleage 54Jirou SuzukiRoyal advisorRyouichi NakaharaRoyal advisorHayato KoizumiRoyal advisorJiro ShimizuShikigami (sorcerer)Shichiro-senseiMaster of the dojoShogunate's ShadowsEmployed under the Shogun is a small faction of shadow warriors that are experts in stealth, espionage, and intelligence - as well as quiet, swift killers when deemed necessary. They answer directly to the Shogun himself and no one else - even the advisors don't care for dealing with these warriors.Master HideakiMakotoRyouichiTsubasaNoriMizukiMonks of NapoWhile Napo is well under Yueqiu's rule and protection, there is a more immediate defense that lies within the farmlands - and a much more peaceful one, at that. The Shaolin monks of Napo are spiritually inclined warriors that would sooner defuse a situation with words before resorting to blows, and not a one would kill even under the most excruciating circumstances. Instead, their skills lie in their boundless patience and broad knowledge on healing arts - some more experienced monks are commonly employed within the main city to tend to the sick and wounded.Grandmaster DaisukeTakeshiRikutoTarouThe FuseiThe lawless and cruel of Dongshu that dominate the majority of the island are dubbed the Fusei. They do as they please, and take what they want by whatever means they can. It's not beneath these cutthroats to lie and cheat, pillage and rape and steal, for what they might desire. And this is outside whatever it is that their leader, called Chi no Tora, might demand of them. The Bloody Tiger's reputation is wide and etched in blood and death, deemed a demon by his own men in his fearless prowess on the battlefield and lack of mercy or understanding for those beneath him. Very few men would slaughter a village - men, women, children and elderly alike - but Chi no Tora is one that will do it with a smile.Chi no Tora (Souma Kimura)", "link_list": ["/user/1702"], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/dxWdfUg.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/TENnNP2.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/XrxiYz6.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/xMtUMB8.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/68hbKdw.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/20yOyc4.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/9wAfwyQ.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/vRG2t3T.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/uj3Wd70.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/IIzqdNN.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/rIHYv2h.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/67wraDo.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/7PKc7J6.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/07NvrGT.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/0H6CJ5i.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/d4YcGQM.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/eBz8GNv.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/qtZuIZW.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/guTYLIV.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/VRIvPAE.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/9hDQvN1.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/GpEBfcW.jpg"], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><font face=\"georgia\"><br><font size=\"6\"><b><i>The Groups, Affiliates and Individuals of Dongshu</i></b></font><br/><br/></br></font></div>"}}
