Sakand is rich with culture and treasure, and is a destination spot for thrill-seeking traders that brave the natural defenses of Sakand in order to cash in on the wealth that being a trader to Sakand can bring.The people of Sakand have become reliant on the Tallak Ak Ara, the tower they built to house their magical crystal that helps to power the mystical metropolis. They feel that since they are so far removed from everywhere else (save travel by ship which is a risk in and of itself) that they no longer have to focus on their mystical martial arts.The cataclysm happens, and as the damage rocks the Sorala Desert, it severely damages the crystal within the Tallak Ak Ara, resulting in a finite well of magic.Because the Crystal is broken and has only a portion left of its magic, the Sakandi economy and stability falls in a direct correlation to the draining of their crystal's power. Traders stop coming to Sakand, a large portion of the population winds up dying or leaving, and the city begins to fades into ruin.5 - 10 Years Ago:A small band of Sakandi heroes decide to find a new magical crystal to help power Sakand and what is left of the once-proud city. They discover a Croerian Water Gem and bring it back to Sakand, repowering the Tallak Ak Ara and helping to make the natural spring there flow as greatly as it once did.Sakand enjoys a short renaissance, where the new and improved flow of magic is used to help build Sakand back into its city of grandeur. All magical efforts are directed to the reconstruction of the city's resources; their flood plains, their food, their buildings, their knowledge centers, and methods are created that are not WHOLLY reliant on the magic of the crystal, but definitely aided by it.1 - 5 Years Ago:Medan, the \"nearest\" country to Sakand, falls to the evil Goraia Regime. Goraia marches upon Sakand, who has no standing armor and no longer has any trained defenses in the mystical martial arts. The Goraians take the Water Gem from Sakand and occupy the city.The lack of the Water Gem is a blow to the city, but thanks to their new policies and the leadership of Lady Fairuz, a woman from one of the noble houses of Sakand, the city is not entirely crippled. They can still go forward with reconstruction efforts, although at a slower pace.Lady Fairuz once again opens and advertises Sakand as a tourist and trading destination, encouraging the economy to be on the rise. She is a part of the oligarchy that now rules Sakand, and is the unofficial face and defacto ambassador between Sakand and Goraia.Very Recent History:The evil Goraia regime is toppled by the empire of Isra, but instead of granting Sakand its freedom, Isra also occupies Sakand. Lady Fairuz is left in charge, but due to the fear of the Sakandi people and the great unknown of its future, Sakand reorganizes itself into a demi-oligarchy, with Fairuz becoming the new Emira of Sakand.Forcibly annexed into the Isranian states, the Emirate of Sakand must host Isra occupation while Emira Fairuz pushes for an industrialization of Sakand's naval and infantry forces.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<b><font size=\"4\"><u>Thousands of years ago:</u></font></b>"}}
