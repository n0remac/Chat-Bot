Taxes and commerce is of the utmost importance within Sakand, and not a single person of the heirarchy wants to spend taxpayer dollars on the livelihood of criminals.\u00a0Because of the beliefs of the Sakandi religion to respect your spirituality and keep it clean, crime is not, even petty, harmless crime, welcomed.Punishable by Lashings / PilloryDisrespect of an Official / Noble (verbal abuse, willful insubordination, etc.)Disrespect of a Spouse (verbal abuse, cuckoldry, etc.)etc.Punishable by MaimingPetty Theft, ExtortionPetty VandalismIllegal business practiceRape, Physical AssaultMultiple counts of crimeIllegal majic\u00a0activityetc.Punishable by Death / BanishmentMurderTreasonCrimes against an Official / NobleMultiple counts of harmful crimeMilitary desertionIllegal majic\u00a0activityBlood Magicetc.CLASS HIERARCHYThe Emira & Her FamilyThe Noble Class - the Vizier/a(s) houses, and a few others, all noble, all with pure bloodlines.The Merchant Class - Most of the officials of Sakand, self-made men that have strong bloodlines.The Artisan Class - Decent bloodlines, and those who have dedicated their lives to the arts, pleasure, and knowledge.The Labor Class - Muddied bloodlines, who have built Sakand on their backs and serve the city. The Military recruits.The Serf Class - Little to no bloodline at all, who are indebted to the Noble and Merchant class's charity and hospitality.CUSTOMSPray once a day for the wellness of your family's ancestors (djinn).Pray twice a day for the wholeness and well-being of your own djinn and majic.All genders are equal within Sakand, with a man no more worthy than a woman.Respect the Noble Houses, for they are Sakand's connection to the Sakandshrianan.Respect the Emira of Sakand, for she is the protectoress of our livelihood.Our physical death is not our end.Our djinn\u00a0must be pure in order to ascend to the tranquility of Sakandshrianan.Men must protect women, Women must honor men, and both must act in a way that deserves such worship.The First Born is your inheritor.Henna tattoos must be applied during the celebrations of milestones in one's life, so the djinn can read one's accomplishments from Sakandshrianan.Tea time is a long-standing tradition that is almost law by now; for it requires drinking the waters of Sakand.The color of amber is the color of love and matrimony, used often at weddings.The color of jade is the color of life and eternity, used often at funerals.Blood magic / Necromancy is forbidden\u00a0and seen as evil.Weddings, funerals, and celebrations of births usually last about 4 - 5 days, depending on expenses.A spouse may choose to end their lives upon the funeral pyres of their deceased husband or wife, joining them in Sakandshrianan.There is a definite separation of classes, with a Noble Class, a Merchant Class, an Artisan Class, a Labor Class, and a Serf Class. A person's bloodline has much to do with this, although without a pure bloodline, one can ascend as high as the Merchant Class, as well as any rank that is not directly involved in the two councils to the Emira.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<b><u><font size=\"4\">LAWS</font></u></b>"}}
