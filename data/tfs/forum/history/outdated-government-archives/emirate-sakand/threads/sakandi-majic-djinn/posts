Noble Houses with pure bloodlines have very strong and deep majic. The peasant caste of Sakand with their very diluted bloodlines will have very little majic.\u00a0BLOODLINES:Sakandi magic is based upon the pureness of one's majic\u00a0and bloodline. It allows for a better and stronger connection to Sakandshrianan, which is the resource for all Ancient Sakandi and Djinn magic.Djinn are more easily controlled by summoners who share this bloodbond with them.ANCIENT SAKANDIAncient Sakandi is a magical language, and it is the only language spoken in the realm of Sakandshrianan.By knowing the \"true\" (i.e. Ancient Sakandian) word for things, the user is granted power\u00a0over these things. For instance, learn the Ancient Sakandi word for \"stone\" and you can make a stone levitate. Learn other Ancient Sakandi words to form coherent sentences, and the user can make the stone do other things.Every Sakandi person born has their True Name and their Chosen Name. A Sakandi guards their True Name like a secret, and will refuse to tell anyone else (most of all, a Djinn) because as with other things, when you learn the Ancient Sakandi word for a person, it grants the user control\u00a0of that person.Using spells via Ancient Sakandi draws on a person's majic, draining their life source. This is why Sakandi people will call upon Djinn, draining their majic\u00a0instead of the User's own.Anyone can learn to speak Ancient Sakandi as a written or spoken language, but a connection must be granted to Sakandshrianan for non-native-Sakandi in order to access the magic of the realm.DJINNDjinn is the Sakandi word for spirit.\u00a0Djinn are physical manifestations of the raw majic a Sakandi once controlled in the physical realm, and only grow more powerful as they exist within the magical realm of Sakandshrianan.Djinn can only\u00a0be summoned if the Sakandi User has the True Name\u00a0of the Djinn.All djinn live in Sakandshrianan, and can only come to the physical plane by being summoned by their True Name, or by having a connection to an item on the physical plane. (i.e. a woman's favorite necklace in life, a scholar's favorite oil lamp, a warrior's favorite sword).Djinn are ancestral. When a Sakandi calls upon a Djinn to help him/her, they are calling upon a Djinn of their direct line to help them. This usually will make the Djinn more amiable, although not always. Users who call upon Djinn must have a confidence in their power and their will.In death, most Sakandi with strong majic\u00a0will become Djinn and ascend to Sakandshrianan, where they will then become a new djinn for their ancestors to summon.BELIEFSRespect your djinnRespect your bloodlinesRespect your eldersRespect the Sakandi WayRespect your majic(More will be updated as questions come along)", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<b><u><font size=\"4\">QUICK OVERVIEW:</font></u></b>"}}
