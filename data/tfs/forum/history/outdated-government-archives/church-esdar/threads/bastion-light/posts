It's a simple room, made of pure white stone, with a dais and several archways enchanted to show a view of the sky outside the island.This room is heavily warded to prevent scrying, teleportation, and entrance by anyone other than The Winged Blade of Justice and Lady Ysaera, the ceiling so heavily inscribed with runes and infused with magic that the energy itself is visible as brilliant light that illuminates the chamber.Above this dais hover five holy symbols, a brilliant elongated eight-pointed star flanked by six glowing wings - this is the Holy Symbol of Protection, gifted to Esdara by the Winged God of the Winds and Skies.Normally, these symbols are arrayed in a very precise pattern, one at the four compass points of the circle and the fifth in the center. But they can be rearranged by the combined will of The Winged Blade of Justice and Lady Ysaera into two formations.The first of these is known as the Absolute Deterrence Barrier.The Absolute Deterrence Barrier creates a murky, brownish, vaguely translucent barrier around the entirety of the island. This barrier prevents anything from passing its boundaries, whether that be light, air, water, spiritual energy, or magic. Instead, this barrier's magical capabilities provides everything the island needs, creating an enclosed ecosystem that generates light, air, and water all on its own, thus protecting the denizens of Esdara from any sort of attack and keeping them safe from harm. Anything attempting to bypass this barrier will be harmlessly, but staunchly, deflected.The second arrangement of symbols is known as the Hostile Deterrence Barrier.The Hostile Deterrence Barrier creates a translucent barrier around the island, much like its benign counterpart, but this one is clear as crystal, allowing an unimpeded view of the island within its confines. One almost wouldn't be able to detect it, if not for the light reflecting off its surface - as though it were made of crystal - and the persistent shimmer of magical energy across the outside. Unlike the purely defensive barrier, the Hostile Deterrence Barrier doesn't prevent air, water, or light getting through it, but nor does it allow spiritual energy or magic. Rather, spiritual energy and magic are simply absorbed and harmlessly dispersed. However, any organic material attempting to pass through the barrier is treated with extreme consequence - living beings coming into contact with the barrier have their life force rapidly drained away, followed by their mortal shell swiftly decomposing. Any organic material aside from metal will meet the same fate, quickly crumbling into no more than constituent parts within moments.", "link_list": ["/user/1407", "/user/1367", "/user/1407", "/user/1367", "/user/1407", "/user/1367"], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/qVA9xR0.png", "http://i.imgur.com/uQnaUOq.jpg", "http://i.imgur.com/Pw9Tcko.jpg", "http://i.imgur.com/DpqML3q.jpg", "http://i.imgur.com/N7zxMkW.jpg"], "html": "Located deep within Esdara's Palace of the Skies is a secret chamber known only to "}}
