The senior members serve the priesthood and the people as Arbiters (judges), and the junior serve as Intercessors (lawyers.) Caerleis Telantes was sanctified for his service to the kingdom by laying Judgement upon an Inquisitor, and being martyred for his ruling.Order of Caerleis Erelim / Leader: High Scribe / Seal: The Winged Scroll & QuillThis Order\u2019s sole purpose is handling the Clerical aspects of the priesthood, seeing to the archival and practical needs of the priesthood, such as managing the priesthood\u2019s funds and allocating them where necessary, the care and maintenance of the kingdom\u2019s records, etc. Caerleis Erelim was sanctified for managing to keep the poor fed and healthy during a time of famine within Esdara.Order of Caerleis Caphriel / Leader: High Inquisitor / Seal: The Winged Blue FlameThe Order of the Inquisitors, the Order of Caerleis Caphriel exists solely to discern the presence of heretics within the populace. As is to be expected, their method of determining heretics is decidedly unpleasant, involving torture of various magnitudes. This Order answers only to their leader, who in turn answers only to the High Priest. Caerleis Caphriel was sanctified for uncovering a Cult of Xoilun among a large portion of the military, that was conspiring to overthrow the current High Priest and High Priestess and take control of Esdara.Order of Caerleia Naya\u2019il / Leader: High Marshal / Seal: The Winged Shield & SwordsAs the Militant branch of the priesthood, the Order of Caerleia Naya\u2019il serves two distinct purposes; for the most part, their ranks are the policing force of the kingdom, but many of their senior members go on to become officers within the military. It is from the ranks of this Order that the esteemed members of the Temple Guard, who protect the Palace of the Skies and the High Priest and High Priestess are selected. This Order\u2019s sanctus, Caerleia Naya\u2019il, was sanctified after defending against an attempt on the lives of the High Priest and High Priestess, during which her own life was lost.Order of Caerleia Anael / Leader: High Cleric / Seal: The Winged StarHaving taken an oath of absolute non-violence, the Order of Caerleia Anael is comprised solely of those who either have some skill with herbal remedies, or access to holy healing magic. They devote their lives and time to tending the sick and poor of Esdara, and are the most beloved of the priesthood aside from the High Priest and High Priestess. Their patron, Caerleia Anael, was sanctified after she purged the kingdom of a great plague with her ingenuity and healing magics.RanksPriests are identified by the toga they wear upon their upper body, secured at either the left or right shoulder (the preference of the wearer) with a clasp that bears the symbol of their Order. The togas are all white, but rank is denoted by the color of the trim which adorns it.Grand AureisThese individuals are the leaders of the Priesthood, forming the Head of each Order, and serve on the Council of Winds. Their full title is \u201cGrand Aureis High (Title Here)\u201d, but they usually get called either \u201cGrand Aureis\u201d (usually by members of the clergy and populace), or \u201cHigh (Title Here)\u201d (by their equals and superiors.) The color of the trim on their togas is a rich deep purple, given the rarity of purple dye within the kingdom. ViridisThere are three Viridis, each one serving to govern a certain section of Esdara, thus there is one for Esdar\u2019ai, one for Cyrili, and one for Zanora\u2019si. Their togas bear trim of a bright crimson color.MyadestisUnder every Viridis is a quartet of Myadestis. They are always of the Orders of Telantes, Erelim, Caphriel, and Anael. They serve as the main Arbiter, accountant, Inquisitor, and Healer for that specific area of the kingdom, aiding the Viridis above them and governing tasks to lessers of their Order for their particular region. The trim on their togas is a bright blue..KryalisThe senior numbers of the priests and priestesses, they get many of the important matters of the priesthood\u2019s responsibilities delegated to them - such as the processing of laws given by the High Priest, the instruction and training of the Meliaris, the performance of various ceremonies, the conscription of civilians to do public works projects, etc. The trim on their togas is a vibrant green. CorenisThe junior numbers of the priests and priestesses. Their togas have trim of a bright, sunny yellow, meant to signify their acceptance into the devotion of the priesthood, in homage of the golden hue reserved solely for the High Priest and High Priestess.MeliarisPriests and priestesses in training. Their togas bear no trim color, making them easily identifiable.", "link_list": ["http://imgur.com/byaWjoz", "http://imgur.com/FTPkzzp", "http://imgur.com/tB5lje9", "http://imgur.com/XuAeOud", "http://imgur.com/WDKLUBi"], "image_list": [], "html": "<u>Orders of the Priesthood &amp; Ranks</u>"}}
