These faeries will be more willing to give you favors or ask for them. They are also less likely to harm you severely if you break one of their laws unintentionally. They will party more and harder. Many of their pranks may be annoying but they will be harmless (for the most part).Unseelie - Are what most people consider the 'eviller' kind. All faeries have some distaste for humans, but Unseelie really like to show it more. If a human steals from them, they are more likely to chop off an arm or steal ALL of their luck as punishment. They will also steal from humans without thinking about the consequences.\u00a0Solitary and Trooping are used to describe if a faerie is a part of court or not.Solitary - Faeries that do not enjoy participating in court functions. They do not belong to one season either. They are usually considered Unseelie because they are more independent and likely to do whatever they wish to get what they want. Examples are: stealing cattle, stealing the essences from a whole silo full of wheat, and using glamour to get a human pregnant (then stealing the child to raise them as a faerie).Trooping - Faeries that are interested in government and participate often. They're usually described as Seelie, but this more depends on what court they are associated with.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Unseelie and Seelie are used to describe the stance that season or individual faerie has for humans."}}
