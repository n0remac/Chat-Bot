Abominations are almost impossible to kill due to the sheer amounts of flesh and bone you need to hack through to get to the vital organs. No two are quite the same, so finding aforementioned organs would be extremely difficult. 5 npc slots each.500 tormented:The tormented make up the bulk of the Battalion of Twisted Flesh. Their unholy screams will give any survivors nightmares for the rest of their days. And don't open the cage, or the tongues will escape. You don't want that. These are a sinner's soul and a torture demon sealed into a single body, and the results are not pretty. 1 npc slot each20 butchers:The butchers are the elite of the Battalion of Twisted Flesh. Wielding huge cleavers, they hack their way through enemy lines with the force of a charging bull and the grace of a ballerina. They wear enormous triangular helmets as a mark of rank and also as a display of their raw strength. Butchers will commit suicide rather than face capture. 10 npc slots each.40 Gibbering devourers:Huge, twisted blobs of flesh containing only eyes and mouths, these are truly the stuff of nightmares. They are always chattering, a maddening, nonsensical gibberish that would drive even the most level-headed man mad within hours. They live only to eat, and add the flesh, eyes, and mouth of their prey to their ever-growing bulk. Many an adventurer has been eaten while staring into the eyes of their loved ones, wide and unblinking on the mass of gelatinous flesh. 5 npc slots each.[/quote]", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/9nzK2gq.jpg", "http://i.imgur.com/R3FL3I2.png", "http://i.imgur.com/Id5BY38.png", "http://i.imgur.com/YuFLAV0.jpg"], "html": "20 abominations:"}}
