They consist of Fallen Paladin\u2019s, all once noble, but now Evil. They are fierce, capable of magic and wielding any weapon. They flatten lands in their march. Their armor is as the picture shows. The Fallen Paladin\u2019s of Labefacto are a force to be reckoned with on the battle field, but they are generally found protecting the capitol of the Labefacto.\u00a0These centaurs stand anywhere between 8\u2019 and 11\u2019 in height. They like to flank due to their ability to carry multiple weapons. Never will you find anything mounted on them, as these are the most respected force in the Labefacto.\u00a0Battalion of Apocalypse\u00a0(400 NPC count \u2013 400 soldiers)\u00a0Vile beast who lust for war. The smell and taste of blood fuels them. They show no mercy on their enemy and smile while they kill them. They are extremely strong, but their mindset is much like an orc. They followed specific orders, and that\u2019s all they do when not in battle. \u00a0These beings stand anywhere from 5\u2019 \u2013 8\u2019 in height. The general skin color is black or gray, but occasionally you will find a red skin. In battle, you will generally find these creatures with the Fallen Paladins of Labefacto.\u00a0Ak-mun: The Second Face\u00a0(100NPC Count - 1 Mage) \u00a0Ak-Mun had lost the faith of mortals in the last year. He has lost much of his godly power, now standing as a powerful mortal. The Heavens cast him to Hell rather than to the mortal realm. In Hell, he found his spot as a Archfiend Mage for Demigrem Demiarch.\u00a0Hizenn \u2013 The Sixth Face\u00a0(100 NPC count - 1 Mage)\u00a0Hizenn, was dealt the same fate as Ak-Mun. He is the only other mage under Demigrem Demiarch. Hizenn\u2019s magic is very different that his counterpart, but just as fierce. Under Demigrem Demiarch, they hope to one day regain their position.\u00a0Read more: thefantasysandbox.boards.net/conversation/1413?page=4#ixzz3o82Tb1t5", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/conversation/1413?page=4#ixzz3o82Tb1t5"], "image_list": ["https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/thumb/a/a0/Centaurs_concept_art.jpg/300px-Centaurs_concept_art.jpg", "http://www.afasyr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/500px-Tannecks-_concept_art.jpg", "http://orig01.deviantart.net/bc6a/f/2014/140/5/f/echo_demise__mage_clothes__by_soulwarrior23-d7j3jzi.jpg", "http://orig03.deviantart.net/7185/f/2011/140/b/0/dark_mage_by_m_hugo-d3gt7fi.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\">The Essence of Evil\u00a0</div>"}}
