The Council of Lords is three nobles, of any rank, who have taken on roles within Gauldin's government taking on responsibility in exchange for power within the country. Each lord holds dominion over a specific aspect of Gauldish society and they speak with the crown's authority in matters that might affect their office. The council is the king's primary advisers and\u00a0they can even overturn his rulings by a unanimous vote. The five lords are as follows:The Lord of Coin: [Open]The Lord of Coin's responsibilities covers anything that has to do with the welfare of the kingdom's treasury. Trade, taxation, the mints, the arts, and anything else that involves either spending coin or earning coin in some way comes back to The Lord of Coin. Funnily the person in this role often winds up being absurdly wealthy usually only second to the king.The Lord of War: [Open]The Lord of War acts as the Field Marshal and overall commander of the noble forces that might be called during times of war. During times of peace, it is his duty to ensure that king's royal guard and his majesties air marines are properly trained and provisioned, in addition, he helps the king manage and run the Royal Air Force.\u00a0The Lord of Magic: [Open]Magic plays a huge part in Gauldish society especially the research and development of new spells and magical items to make the populace's lives easier.
