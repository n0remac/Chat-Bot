Once you have posted you must wait for a response to continue on. In your post you may detail that you filled out the necessary paperwork, acquired travel papers, and had any cargo searched for contraband. (Contraband in Gauldin includes items with necromantic powers, illicit substances, and human cargo.) If you do so then the nod to proceed can be given in chat\u00a0without waiting for a post back.\u00a0OoC notes about the travel papers: Foreign characters in Gauldin are considered as having their travel papers on them at all times unless specifically noted otherwise by the player. These papers are enchanted, the enchantments allow for tracking and scrying of the papers holder. Well, the magic on the papers can be detected, if it is tampered with the papers will burst into flames. If your character is caught without travel papers they will be imprisoned. New papers can be acquired by talking to the city guard in any city.**Important: When posting into Gauldin tag or PM King Renaux of Trav\u00e9re for a response or ask someone to alert Alden Marshal in chat, otherwise I might miss you. I'm a busy guy and right now the only one in Gauldin's government so it helps!**", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/969/post-first-eastern-naval-checkpoint?page=1", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/959/post-first-southern-valley-pass?page=1"], "image_list": [], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><b>For travelers looking to enter Gauldin please note the following.</b><br><br/><br/></br></div>"}}
