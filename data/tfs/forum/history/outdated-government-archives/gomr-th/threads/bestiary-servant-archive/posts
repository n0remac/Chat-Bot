They live in small tribes, answering only to the strong. From a distance they appear almost human, standing roughly at the same height, possessing roughly the same strength. These orcs are not to be underestimated though, for strength and ferocity are the only traits that are respected in their society. They make up mediocre soldiers due to low morale and being slightly dim witted. These orcs however can be bred with other creatures to create sub-species. They make great archers and scouts. Easily persuaded these creatures will follow anyone strong. They are often associated with conflict or war, but they rarely go to war since they lack the skills to create a kingdom or empire of their own. Orcs live in huts, and spend most of their time raiding and eating. Grul-Nash are a sub-species of the Grul, commonly know as simply Orc. These creatures are much larger and much more fierce than the orcs. The dice is rolled every time a Grul-Nash is bred, and the reward is either really high, or really low. One could produce a specimen of high intelligence, standing at eight feet. One could also produce a six foot simpleton. These heavy-set orcs will usually carry two-handed weaponry and fight with little to no fear. They are commonly placed on the front lines, acting as berserkers, or a means of intimidation for the opposing army. Finer specimens have been capable of cleaving men in full plate in half and running in full gear for days, rendering them some of the best warriors out there. Grul-Nash have been known to have authority issues, this causes them to become full fledged soldiers slower than others. These creatures have been known to enter an almost trance-like state during battle, they can withstand tremendous trauma and keep fighting with multiple arrows lodged in their flesh.These creatures are not born of burrows and are harder to come by than your average orc. Inhabiting the mountains they will usually live out their lives peacefully, stealing a sheep or two along the way. Once enslaved and bred in captivity, they are easily convinced of another purpose, and these trolls are not only effective with labor, they are quite terrifying on the battlefield. They usually grow between thirty and forty feet, equipped with strength to knock over a small tower and jaws to bite through metal. Once armored and trained, placing a troll like this on the front lines certainly makes the enemy think twice. They do not pose much of a threat to whoever they are in service to, for they do not live for much but food and shelter, provide this and one will be fine.The wraith is a mysterious creature often associated with evil. They are spirits that linger between life and death, not able to die, not able to live. This causes them to be invisible to mortal man, unless they choose to wear clothing that is. They are rarely found speaking or uttering much noise at all, but when they do their voices have been known to drive men insane. A wraith can be made in numerous ways, but most of the time they are created in death. Certain dark wizards hold the ability to enslave a soul, essentially not allowing it to leave their side until they choose to. Al M\u00farin\u2019s wraiths are bound through contracts they made in life, swearing eternal fealty to their master. There is the exception of Dorathil, in which case Al M\u00farin had one of his wraiths harvest the soul of a powerful elf mage. Al M\u00farin would then take said soul and bind it to a set of armor, creating a unique wraith. To kill a wraith is extremely difficult, but they can be destroyed through powerful divine incantations. A weapon infused with holy magic could potentially harm a wraith, but it is uncertain to what extent. Fiends are commonly found throughout\u00a0Gomr\u00e2th and have previously filled out the ranks of Al M\u00farin's army. These creatures are living dead, but oddly intelligent. Standing at roughly seven feet, the fiend is a quite large creature although it prefers to run on all fours in most cases. They will equip themselves with daggers and spears and generally prefer little to no armor. Fiends can't be trained like orcs or trolls, they are servants to whoever raises them.\u00a0These creatures are of a particularly sadistic nature and will enjoy torturing and toying with their victim until death seems appropriate. After having killed something, the fiend will usually devour the carcass raw, for these creatures thirst for blood more than anything.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/B1um3rC.jpg", "http://i.imgur.com/eBhAWcX.jpg", "http://i.imgur.com/inGYp2n.jpg", "http://i.imgur.com/FnfaVOp.jpg", "http://i.imgur.com/7wAKKPy.png"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><font size=\"2\">(More creatures will be added along the way, when I have time to update)</font><br><br/><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/B1um3rC.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/></br></div>"}}
