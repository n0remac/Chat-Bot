Volcanic activity and interference from its inhabitants has halted any organic growth entirely. The land is a barren wasteland riddled with fire, ash and dust. The air is toxic from the fumes that constantly rise from the ground, one would certainly find visiting\u00a0Gomr\u00e2th very unpleasant.\u00a0Gomr\u00e2th is protected by mountain ranges that surround in an almost rectangular fashion, shielding it from any invading army. There are two means for an army to enter or exit\u00a0Gomr\u00e2th, one is the gate on the northern border, the other by docking on the southern border. Both entrances are fortified and near impossible to access or breach without terrible loss.\u00a0There are known paths that lead through the mountain ranges, but these roads are treacherous and only wide enough to pass in single file. The unscaleable mountains and horrible quality of the land has made\u00a0Gomr\u00e2th an easy place to defend, not many have attempted to invade it.\u00a0Once inside\u00a0Gomr\u00e2th one would find the land surprisingly flat, only a few hills or high-steppes would make an exception of this. Camps, training grounds and fortresses riddle the hills, leaving little room to travel unseen. Due to the extremely unpredictable landscape, a road has been built leading to most destinations within\u00a0Gomr\u00e2th. Straying from this rode could mean death if one didn't know how to fare the grounds, it is highly advisable to stay on it.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/XO9C620.png"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/XO9C620.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/><br><font size=\"2\">(The small pentagons are establishments/fortresses)</font><br/><br/></br></div>"}, "post-12640": {"user": "Labefacto Demigrem Demiarch", "user_num": 707, "timestamp": "1443972755000", "message": "Where is this land at on the map extactly?
