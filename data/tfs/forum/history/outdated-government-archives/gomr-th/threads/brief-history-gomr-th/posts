Two kingdoms of man inhabited the lush forests and hills, co-existing in harmony through generations. Al M\u00farin was then known as Hafthor Eriksen, a hard working court wizard for one of the kings. Al M\u00farin's influence with the king was strong, and it only grew stronger over the years. Soon the king trusted Al M\u00farin with all of his affairs, the health of his family and the health of his nation. Little did the esteemed king know that Al M\u00farin had poisoned his mind. Al M\u00farin latched himself in the kings brain and war broke out. It was a terrible, terrible war lasting over a decade. In the end both kings were dead, their heritage gone, their history gone. Al M\u00farin took the place of high-king, ruling over both civilizations as their eternal monarch.\u00a0The sick and twisted magic that Al M\u00farin tempered with was effecting the world around him, corrupting the land and its people. The lush forests were soon gone, the plains as well. Al M\u00farin transformed the world through slavery and magic, shaping an empire in his image. Soon the people would find themselves wielding blades instead of pitchforks and spades, soon they found themselves in armor rather than cloth. War came upon neighboring nations, and Al M\u00farin stopped at nothing to see his task complete.\u00a0Five-hundred years passed, and the world of man had found a new ruler. United under one banner, the twelve kingdoms of men all subjugated themselves to the will of Al M\u00farin. Peace was absolute, but the living conditions that men suffered under Al M\u00farin's reign were unspeakable. Sophistication, tradition and culture died in time, and the great kingdoms of men that had once been a monument to power and learning, were now but barbarian hordes.\u00a0Al M\u00farin had lived an unnaturally long life. His body was getting weaker and weaker, so he modified it through magic, rendering it strong and able. As time passed Al M\u00farin looked less and less human. In the end he bound himself to a suit of armor, his body protected by numerous enchantments and incantations. Al M\u00farin had ran out of nations to conquer, so he rallied his forces and decided he'd bring his rule to new shores.\u00a0As Al M\u00farin's army waged war on the neighboring continents, he animated himself an impenetrable fortress, an eternal city. Al M\u00farin aggravated the volcanic landscape into erupting, covering entire cities in molten lava for a fresh start. Tornadoes, hurricanes and earthquakes were constant for the better part of a century in\u00a0Gomr\u00e2th. The devastating work of Al M\u00farin had given birth to a new nation, a new climate.\u00a0Gomr\u00e2th was molded by massive volcanic eruptions and natural disasters, leaving it a perfect place for Al M\u00farin to construct his legacy. Al M\u00farin had set his eyes upon the neighboring kingdom of the Golfir\u00e9l elves. His armies washed up on their shores, burning and pillaging their way into the heart of the elven kingdom. Al M\u00farin was busy building as the war waged on, his ultimate creation coming to life in the shape of\u00a0N\u00e2shagrar.\u00a0N\u00e2shagrar was a fortress that extended miles upon miles into the crust of the very earth. It was impenetrable and large enough to produce Al M\u00farin an army of new found slaves.\u00a0Wretches and unholy creations sprung from the depths of\u00a0N\u00e2shagrar, and brought new life to the war in the elven kingdom. Al M\u00farin had created terrors that even he had trouble controlling, and so he unleashed them upon the world. From\u00a0N\u00e2shagrar Al M\u00farin would rule until his undoing, and it came in the shape of treason. The elves had surrendered, the war was over. Al M\u00farin was invited to their capital to discuss terms of surrender. Blinded by his power and own arrogance, Al M\u00farin went under the impression that no foe could match him. Three great elf wizards battled him upon the peninsular of R\u00e2uhr. The fight was long and violent, ultimately ending in Al M\u00farin's imprisonment. The three wizards could lock him away and banish him from the mortal realm, but they did not hold power to destroy him.\u00a0His kingdom vanished, lost to the ages. The memory of Al M\u00farin's rule had faded, his armies were long disbanded and his presence forgotten.\u00a0There was however parts of his legacy that endured. Al M\u00farin had summoned evil so great that it could not be vanquished. His servants scurried into the far parts of the world, some into hiding, some deep under ground.\u00a0N\u00e2shagrar became a stronghold for his most loyal subjects to plot his return, to maintain and uphold his ideas during his leave.\u00a0The cataclysm reshaped the world once more, leaving\u00a0Gomr\u00e2th not much different from what it had been under Al M\u00farin's rule. The location of\u00a0Gomr\u00e2th was however forgotten, seeing as all empires relevant in its time of making were now but history in the pages of a book.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Ten thousand years before the cataclysm\u00a0Gomr\u00e2th was a flourishing landscape of green wonder.
