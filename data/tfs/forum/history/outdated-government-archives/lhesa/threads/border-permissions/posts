The seaways are patrolled by a privateer force primarily concerned with finding smugglers attempting to take valuable artifacts and treasures from the old city. Visibly armed vessels or ships coming in groups will alert the patrols and be checked. [Individuals coming to Lhesa from other locations in the Overworld must post here upon entering Lhessian waters. Warships, pirates, smugglers, and vessels bearing official envoys or representatives of other nations and their governments need to wait for a response, all others may proceed directly to the island.]The docks are the main entrance to the city itself, and as such, are regularly patrolled by the city watch. They are given broad leeway to check cargoes coming in and out of the city as well as keeping the peace. [Individuals entering or leaving the city of Lhesa by sea must post here upon arrival at the docks. Anyone loading or unloading cargo, bringing an NPC guard force, or acting as the official envoy or representative of another nation need to wait for a response, all others may proceed into the city freely.]The Jungle Gate on the eastern wall between the city and the wilds of the jungle is kept closed and barred at all times, with a contingent of soldiers watching. The guards generally aren\u2019t expecting trouble, but neither are they expecting travelers, so anyone passing through here is sure to get their attention. [Individuals entering or leaving the city of Lhesa by land routes must post here, even if they aren\u2019t actually passing through the gate. All travelers passing over, under, or through the wall or gate need to wait for a response before proceeding into the city itself.]", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/2790/lhesa-seaways-post-first", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/2791/lhesa-docks-post-first", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/2792/jungle-gate-post-first"], "image_list": [], "html": "Through a combination of official policy and practical limitations, Lhesa\u2019s borders are generally relatively open.
