to prove themselves in combat, whose thirst for battle and untamed zeal knows no equal.\u00a0 Although undisciplined and disorderly, these warriors are quick, agile, and relentless in battle.\u00a0 Varan commanders typically use them as light infantry, spearmen, or archers.\u00a0 An Unproven unit which has seen some combat is usually referred to as Proven, and may have acquired better weapons from their fallen enemies, and may be slightly more disciplined and orderly.Huscarls (Cost: 2)These battle-tested, seasoned veterans form the true back-bone of the Varan military.\u00a0 Well-equipped, well-trained, and highly reliable infantry, these medium-armored Varan warriors are excellent shock troops.\u00a0 They're much more disciplined than the Unproven and are typically equipped with swords and axes, in conjunction with shields.\u00a0 It is said that a Huscarls charge is nigh unstoppable, and a Huscarl shield wall is nigh impregnable.\u00a0 Many Huscarls may own farm horses, but it is rare they ride them in battle since they're not bred for war, though there have been times light cavalry regiments were formed.Nostmen (Cost: 4)The closest thing the Varan have to a knight, the Nostmen are composed of the nobles and their household guards.\u00a0 Easily the greatest warriors within an Earl's hold, these nobles are able to acquire the highest-quality armor and weapons available to them, and can afford to maintain proper warhorses, who tend to be just as heavily armored as the Nostmen.\u00a0 Nostmen are generally equipped with lances, axes, swords, and shields to use in combat, and can double as heavy infantry should the need arise.Wolf-Riders (Cost: 5)Exclusive to the Valgard clan (Aesa Jojora and Ralf Valgard), the Wolf-Riders are those Nostmen from Valland who ride atop mighty dire wolves instead of a warhose.\u00a0 They're much quicker and deadlier than a horse, and can actually fight in forests unlike horse-mounted Nostmen.\u00a0 Wolf-Riders have been used by the Valgard clan for generations.Storm-Lords (Cost: 25)All kings require a royal guard, and the High King of Asgeir makes no exception.\u00a0 Only the greatest warriors in Asgeir has the honor of becoming Stormguard, and those who do are counted amongst the greatest warriors Asgeir has to offer.\u00a0 These Varan are equipped with Vanian-forged armor and weapons.\u00a0 Finally, they're equipped with powerful storm gauntlets, allowing them to shock their enemies and, when in unison, conjure storms and control the rain, wind, and lightning.", "link_list": [], "image_list":
