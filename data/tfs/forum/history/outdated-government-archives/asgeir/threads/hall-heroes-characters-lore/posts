They are known to be exceptional warriors, benevolent leaders, and inspirational commanders.  The Valgard sigil is a blue field with a white wolf's head in the center, and it decorates their Ki'gars.  Their words are \"Honor, Family, Loyalty\".  Most Valgards in history have preferred using a sword-and-shield combination with light or medium armor.The Valgards have the ability to morph into werewolves, though none of them know of this ability except for Ralf Valgard.Ancient Age:  Targ the Raper'Targ the Raper' was the focal point of many stories, legends, and tales concerning the Valgard clan.\u00a0 The stories go on to say that, in the barbaric ages of Asgeir, a great warrior by the name of Targ roamed the snowy landscapes of the north.\u00a0 Targ was unmatched in strength, speed, and cunning, and used his talents to slay many talented and powerful opponents.\u00a0 He was infamous throughout the land and feared by all.\u00a0 Targ was a man who kidnapped the women of his fallen opponents, raped them, and left them to die.\u00a0 He was brutal and unforgiving, and it's no wonder the Valgard's themselves don't like to mention him.\u00a0 Apparently, Targ had many descendants, but one of those descendants took the name Valgard and was an exceptional warrior himself.Middling Age:  Igor Valgard, Taern ValgardIgor Valgard was a descendant of Targ, and led a warband into modern-day Valland.\u00a0 Igor was mostly known for slaying a sorceress, binding her up, and letting her rot (and this site is now commemorated by the Blackened Bitch Inn, located in Valland).\u00a0 Igor went on to mine the region's blackstone, build Wulfenheim Hall, and laid the foundations for the hold of Valland.Taern was perhaps a son or grandson of Igor, and was probably in line for jarlship of Valland.\u00a0 He met his unfotunate fate when he fought a massive direwolf in the woods of Valland.\u00a0 While Taern was victorious in his battle, he sustained many injuries died shortly after.\u00a0 Taern carved the legend of his battle into a rune stone called Taern's Rest, and they say his spirit grants travelers great power.Age of Heroes:  Tarro Valgard, Lyza Valgard, Volrun Valgard, Aesa JojoraTarro Valgard was Jarl of Valland when the realm was invaded by foreigners.\u00a0 He rallied the men of Valland and retreated to Stormhold, where he rendezvoused with Jarl Borg I of Stormhold and Koros Jarn.\u00a0 Tarro, Borg, and Koros became known as the Thundering Three and led the armies of Asgeir to victory, reclaiming their lost land.\u00a0 Tarro supported a united Asgeir and proposed Jarl Borg I be elected the first High King of the Kingdom of Asgeir, which succeeded.\u00a0 Lyza Valgard was the wife of Tarro, and shieldmaiden who fought alongside him in this age.Volrun Valgard was the son of Tarro, and a respected warrior.\u00a0 He rallied a warband and marched to Gripclaw Pass, where he was killed in battle.\u00a0 He never married, but he did not have an heir: Aesa Jojora.\u00a0 Aesa became an honorary member of the family and assumed jarlship until her son, Ralf came of age to rule.\u00a0 Aesa is no co-jarl of Valland.Modern Age:  Ralf Valgard, Torr ValgardRalf Valgard is the co-jarl of Valland, former adventurer, and seasoned warrior.\u00a0 He has one son: Torr Valgard, also a warrior by trade and adventurer.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<div
