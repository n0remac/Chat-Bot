they'd mine during the warmer seasons and return to the main settlement to sell their ore before resting there the Winter.\u00a0 Smithing became an honorable and popular trade, allowing better weapons, armor, and farming tools.\u00a0 Masonry became important with the advancement in construction.\u00a0 Great inns were popular, as workers often spent their time here during the Winter.\u00a0 Other villages appeared near or within forests, as better lumber could be harvested and taken to the main settlement for profit; one practice popular in Asgeir involved cutting massive trees and sending it down the main river, where it floated into the main settlement and was collected by workers there.\u00a0 Most goods were taken to the main settlement via horse-drawn wagonThe small villages which dotted the region evolved into self-sustaining settlements.\u00a0 Farms were built, artisans arrived, advanced homes were constructed, they obtained their own livestock, etc.\u00a0 No longer did the workers have to return to the main settlement during the Winter; they could remain in their village all year round.\u00a0 The main settlements remained important trading centers and central hubs for the various towns and villages surrounding it.\u00a0 Miners may sell ore to local smiths, farmers may sell to local citizens, etc, but everyone knew it was best to take your best products to the main settlement, where buyers could browse the wares of the entire province in the proximity of a single market.\u00a0 Taxes were collected and taken to the leaders of these main settlements, who used it to hire masons and builders to raise forts across the land in order to fend off would-be attackers.The main settlements became the capital of a hold.\u00a0 A hold became recognized as the territories surrounding these capitals; all of the villages, towns, forts, etc that relied on the capitals belonged to that hold.\u00a0 Each hold developed their own laws, customs, and traditions.\u00a0 The political leaders of the hold swore fealty to a king, who resided in the hold capital.\u00a0 'Political leaders' denotes important individuals who oversaw development and function in the towns and villages throughout the hold; they usually owned large manors and/or forts, and handled the taxes of the people under their domain; these leaders, their families, and retinue, are known as Nostmen (Nostmen are the nobility in Varan culture).", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><b><i>Founding of Bleakharbor and Varan Expansion<br/></i></b></div>"}}
