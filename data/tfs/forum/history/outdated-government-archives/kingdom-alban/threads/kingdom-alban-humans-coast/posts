When the House Arach held power they were the most prosperous of the four races. The native tribes respected the humans and their borders, grateful for the peace Andurin forged. Then An Dl\u00ed was lost due to human greed. Without the mystic blade the peace shattered and humans are now treated as they were in the ancient past. They cower in their coastal villages living under constant threat of attack. Those not living in fear on the coast are entrapped in the walled city of Avelius. They fear to tread in land for though the humans outnumber the native races, they have little defense against magic. The gift of magic is rare amongst the men and women of Alban. Those rare few born with the gift are taken to Avelius. There they are trained to help keep up the ward that keeps The Wyld at bay.\u00a0The government of the humans has seen significant change in recent years. Once they were a feudal system ruled by a monarch. Then the usurper king B\u00e0nach was cast down no one rose to take his place. Who would dare? After all, it had been definitively proven that only the bloodline of Arach could rule as kings. These days the humans are ruled by mayors in the coastal villages and the council of thirteen in Avelius. These positions are won in a general election every four years. The council of thirteen is lead by the high chancellor who is elected during a closed vote. \u00a0There is little else to say of the humans of Alban. They are beaten, whipped, and frightened. When they first arrived they had a tentative peace with the dwarves. When An Dl\u00ed was lost the dwarves broke all contact with the humans. Without the dwarven aid they had in their nascent days, the humans simply have no chance against Fae and Wildlings raids. The humans of Alban are a dying species. They are only holding on through sheer tenacious will; tenacious will and the hope that one day An Dl\u00ed will return to them. \u00a0\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><b><u><font size=\"4\">The Humans of The Coast and The City of Avelius:\u00a0</font></u></b></div>"}}
