This is given to any youth under the age of sixteen who wishes to join the knighthood. Squires have the traditional duties associated with the role. They serve a knight, caring for his horse, helping him don his armor, polishing his sword, and other menial tasks. In exchange, the squire is provided food, shelter, and training in knightly ways.The second rank is Knight Brother. This is awarded to a squire when their knight deems them ready. Or immediately to a warrior who shows considerable valor. This rank is a title equivalent to a baron in Alban though it doesn\u2019t come with lands as it might once have in the past. Knights of this level make up the majority of the order.The third rank is Knight Captain. This is awarded to brothers who show exceptional leadership capabilities. As the knights are a military force Knight Captains act as field commanders. They have a rank equivalent to an earl within Alban. The king has also decided to award lands to those who are promoted to this rank.The fourth and final rank is Knight Commander. This is given to the leader of the Airgid'Na'Gealaich. He acts as general of not just the knights, but all of Alban\u2019s human soldiers. In military matters, the Knight Commander is second only to the king. This rank is considered the equivalent of a Duke in Alban.The knighthood is the primary military force of the human population of the human population of Alban. Given the current size of this force they also occasionally double as city guards. Knights are expected to follow the tenets of chivalry which are as follows:Thou shalt respect all weaknesses, and shalt constitute thyself the defender of them.Thou shalt deal with a fair hand with all races.Thou shalt not recoil before thine enemy.Thou shalt never lie, and shalt remain faithful to thy pledged word.Thou shalt be everywhere and always the champion of the Right and the Good against Injustice and Evil.Current Members of The Knighthood:Knight Commander\u00a0-Open position\u00a0Knight Captain\u00a0-Mihael L\u00e0idir \u00a0Knight Brother\u00a0-Sir Cairex Forgepyre \u00a0Squire\u00a0-None currently\u00a0If you are interested in joining the order contact King Averin Arach .", "link_list": ["/user/1470", "/user/1278", "/user/1234"], "image_list": [], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><b><u>Organizational Structure &amp; Rules of the Knighthood:\u00a0</u></b></div>"}, "post-51321": {"user": "The Kingdom of Alban", "user_num": 1285, "timestamp": "1475010879000", "message": "History of The Knights of Airgid'Na'Gealaich:Prior to the coup by Duke Hevrin B\u00e0nach the Knights of Airgid'Na'Gealaich were an order of knights similar to what you would find in any kingdom. However, following the Duke\u2019s betrayal they slowly turned into something else. Over time the blue cloak and silver moon emblem of the knighthood became a symbol of hope to the humans of Alban.The death of the old king meant that the alliance between man, dwarf, wildling, and fae was broken. The magical races of Alban turned upon the humans. The dwarves simply snubbed them. But the fae and the wildlings took to hunting the weaker race. Slowly over time humanity was driven back to its last bastion, the city of Avelius.It was five years after his coup that Hevrin B\u00e0nach fell. The blue cloaks took arms against the usurper king, killing him and those loyal to him in the hopes that an Arach heir would return to his lands once the man who stole his throne was dead. Unfortunately, it would be another fifteen years before such a man appeared. During those years the Knights of Airgid'Na'Gealaich remained as defenders of the city their order turning into something different than what it was. They became the city's elite guards, trained to fight against Wildings and Fae,given what blessings could be provided against their terrible magics. Yet even with these provisions they still died. Not often, but frequently enough that their membership had dropped by half in two years. A knighthood is supposed to be an honor that can only be bestowed by a king. The order, however, decided that to survive they must ignore such restrictions. Not only that, they waved away the tradition that said only a noble could be inducted. Instead, the order inducted any man who showed sufficient talent into their ranks. The Knights of Airgid'Na'Gealaich became the city's best, indeed often its only defense against attacks by the other races. Its popularity swelled and many young men trained tirelessly to join their ranks. Sadly, this wasn\u2019t enough. The city's population slowly declined and with it so did the ranks of the order. By the time King Averin Arach  retook the city there were less than three hundred blue cloaks. A far cry from their numbers which had once been in the thousands. Still, they celebrated to have their king returned, though many in the order feared what would become of it. After all, it had changed so much from what it once was. These fears though were unfounded. Averin granted true knighthoods to all current brothers and allowed them to keep current recruitment policies. The order is now looking to grow and expand, hoping to one day reach its former glory and perhaps even eclipse it.", "link_list": ["/user/1234"], "image_list": [], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><b><u>History of The Knights of Airgid'Na'Gealaich:</u></b></div>"}}
