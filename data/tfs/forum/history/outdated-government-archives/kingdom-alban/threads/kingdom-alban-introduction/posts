Once, long ago, its empire was great and powerful. The world knew Alban\u2019s\u00a0name, and it\u2019s great navies and vast armies were feared and respected by all. Now, it is torn by a violent civil war that pits brother against brother, father against son, countryman against countryman. This is a land of subtle magics, dark mystery, and powerful tradition. \u00a0It is said in many kingdoms that the king has a divine mandate to rule. In most cases this is merely propaganda. In Alban, it is truth. Since time immemorial Alban has been ruled by House Arach. Under their rule the land was rich and fertile, and the wylds were held at bay, thanks to the mystic blade An Dl\u00ed.\u00a0There are three forms of magic and three native races found within Alban: The Druidry of the Fae, The Blood magics of the Wildlings, and The Metallurgy of the Dwarves. An Dl\u00ed is the living symbol of a pact between the natives, and the humans. The blade was forged from all three magics and bound to the bloodline Andurin Arach.  It was decreed that the blade must always be present in the lands, and wielded by the hands of a trueborn son of Andurin. So long as this was true, the Wyld\u2019s growth would slow, and Alban would prosper. This truth was passed down for years until history became legend, and legend became myth.\u00a0Twenty years ago the treacherous Duke Hevrin B\u00e0nach lead a revolt against King Derim Arach. While Derim was a weak and ineffectual king, Hevrin was a brilliant general, and a skilled and powerful warrior.  The Duke\u2019s coup was successful, and the Arach royal family was slaughtered. During the battle An Dl\u00ed was lost, but Hevrin cared not. To him, it was just a sword. A sword surrounded by myth, perhaps, but simply a piece of steel with a story. \u00a0The newly crowned King B\u00e0nach ruled for five years. In that time once rich soil became barren, wells began to dry, and the wyld, once thought to be defeated, started to spread once again. Eventually it became obvious that the ancient legends were true. Without An Dl\u00ed, Alban would wither and die. The people, angry at this turn of events, revolted. B\u00e0nach was cast down and killed, his name spoken alongside the vilest of curses. The only hope for the people of Alban now lies within a rumour: the youngest son of King Derim was said to have escaped the slaughter of his family, and disappeared to a foreign land.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/dp5EdHf.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><b><u><font size=\"5\">The Kingdom of Alban</font></u></b></div>"}}
