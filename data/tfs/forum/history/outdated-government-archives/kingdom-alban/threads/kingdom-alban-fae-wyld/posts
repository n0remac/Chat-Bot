There are many ancient woods in the world. Deep and dark, where magic and beast rule and men fear to tread. The Wyld is perhaps the oldest of them and definitely the most dangerous. The Wyld is suffused with the energy of the earth, and because of this the life of the forest is deadly. The trees grow unnaturally tall and far too swiftly. A team of men can spend a day clearing a field, and by the next morning find it filled with old growth. The animals found within The Wyld are far larger and more aggressive. Wolves bigger than men, deer as large as horses, and bears whose footfalls make the ground tremble. Then there are the monsters: Trolls, goblins, wyvern, giants, dragons, and dark nameless things to count only a handful. Though this would be enough to scare most away, some brave (or foolish) men still enter. They often die.  Still, the most terrifying thing in these woods are the Fae. \u00a0The Fae of The Wyld are the remnants of the original Sidhe court. Once ruled by the Erlkonig, these Fae seek to emulate their mighty forebearer. This desire manifested in two ways. First they sought to connect with the earth. Making a pact with the earth spirit Mother Gaia, they magically bound themselves to her becoming the first druids. They were the first tribe of Alban and dwelled in the woods for millennia. Over time, their connection with the earth slowly strengthened. So much so that a glut of earth magic developed within the heart of their forest causing  the strange phenomenon of The Wyld. It is filled with more life magic than perhaps any other place in the world.\u00a0The second way The Fae of the Wyld seek to emulate their forebearer, is with the hunt. The Erlkonig is known as the master of the hunt. The Fae of the Wyld seek to be worthy of his legacy. Almost all of the eternal Fae of the Wyld know how to hunt and do so frequently. As one might expect, hunting the ferocious and magical enhanced game of The Wyld is dangerous. Fortunately the Fae are more dangerous. Beyond their natural abilities, they are all bound to the earth. Each one can supplement their already preternatural strength and speed with energy from Mother Gaia. They are also extremely skilled at tracking, archery, and stealth. The Fae are long lived and they have had much time to polish their art.\u00a0The Fae have a single city, though \u201ctown\u201d may be a more appropriate word. It is called Sc\u00e1th\u2019leann and it is built within the bows of five massive trees. Each of the Home Trees, as they are called, is easily 500 meters in diameter and stretches far into the sky. The Fae live in tree houses near the top, with shops and public buildings carved into the trunks. Few mortals have ever set eyes on this place. Those who have often remember it with a tear in their eye. Sc\u00e1th\u2019leann  is said to be beyond beautiful.\u00a0The Fae are governed by a hierarchy that is a combination of prowess in Druidry, age, and sheer tenacity. They are almost always in a constant scramble for power, trying to ascend the ladder to the highest seat of rule. Just above the common denizen is a circle of four. Two of the wisest, oldest, and most powerful Fae from each gender hold a seat on the circle. A step above this circle is the M\u00f3r Crann, which translates to \u201cGreat Tree\u201d; this is the leader of the Fae as a whole. The current M\u00f3r Crann is Ailion\u00f3ra u\u00ed Muineach\u00e1in. She is the epitome of what it means to be Fae; a wild and feral woman, elegant and lovely, with a vicious streak that leaves many quaking in fear.\u00a0There are but three laws in the Wyld: Do not kill what you cannot use. Do not harm or kill another Fae without due cause. Never betray the Fae or the Wyld to outsiders.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><font size=\"4\"><b><u>The Fae of The Wyld and their Druidry:\u00a0</u></b></font></div>"}}
