At the ocean thread, a small passenger ship can pass through no issue. A warship might be able to get to the coastline without raising suspicion though we will roll for that to be fair. An attack can't be launched without attracting attention so at that point passing through will be handled by the account.\u00a0If you reach the docks of Avelius you can move freely without stopping at the border. If you wish to go into the Moors, The Wyld, or The Foothills you must wait for permission to pass into that territory.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><b><u><font size=\"5\">The Kingdom of Alban - Border Policy</font></u></b></div>"}}
