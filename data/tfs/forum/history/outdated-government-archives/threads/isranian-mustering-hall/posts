Im not worried about any aggression, but let's say in theory, an aggressive state actor decides to attack us this day, with little warning.Again as we all know, our fighting force depends on the number of active accounts that can muster to the cause. \u00a0If you identify as an Isranian citizen OR account, please post here, so that we can get an accurate representation of what our strength is. After all, there may be a marked difference between total fighting force and active, deployable fighting force. let's say the attack happens today (2/25/2016). In the coming days, what would we be capable of? There are many factors that could affect this and so I think this is worth asking ourselves.If the attack happened today, a week is a reasonably long amount of time to prepare even just our first response. Within that amount of time, Isra would probably be mounting a defense. Therefore, I am going to like one of everyone's posts and then count the likes at the end of a week from now. However many likes we have is the maximum NPC count we'd have to Isra's name in the case of that defense, which should provide a more accurate perspective of things for the future. To be safe, accounts with fewer than 5 posts aren't what I'm confident would count as active yet, and so I will only like accounts that have been \"broken in\" so to say.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "As we may know, or would find out as news began trickling in from our border with Medan, an immensely powerful figure has transformed the land and society there and to be honest, it is a little bit unnerving.
