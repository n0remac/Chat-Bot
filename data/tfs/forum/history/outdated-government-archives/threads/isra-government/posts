{"post-35048": {"user": "The Isran Empire", "user_num": 1310, "timestamp": "1461702048000", "message": "GovernmentThe Government of The Free States of Isra\u00a0is based on a democratic foundational principle, where an Assembly of one hundred elected officials forms a senate with the express purpose of representing the people. They vote on laws, run the state and are often elected further into seats of influence and power as ministers charged with governing a certain area. At the head of the government is an official head of state, known as the Lord or Lady of The Free City, who has the power to declare states of emergency and take emergency power into their own hands a situation arises that would require it. The Lord or Lady is elected by a vote in the Assembly. Once voted they remain in power until their death, their resignation, or by a two-thirds vote of the assembly to remove them from power.The Conclave is formed of selected Assembly members, appointed by the Lady of Isra upon the advice of the Chancellor. The Conclave, convened and led by the Chancellor, serves to create, draft, and propose bills for the Assembly to ratify.\u00a0All members of the Conclave are assigned portfolios detailing their responsibilities as leaders of Isran society. They are expected to report back on activities within their bailiwicks at every meeting, as well as overseeing any proposals of bills that fall in their sphere of influence.\u00a0The Assembly, a considerably larger body than the Conclave, ratifies any bills proposed by its smaller counterpart. Although it plays a substantially less significant role in the new governmental set-up, the Assembly is still absolutely crucial, as, without a majority vote, no new bill can be passed. All bills proposed must also be signed off on by either the Lady or Chancellor of Isra.\u00a0High Lady of the Free City: Madame Naoki The ConclaveChancellor of Isra &\u00a0Convener of The Conclave:\u00a0Chancellor Ryden Greyiron Minister for the Judiciary:\u00a0Minister Deathforge Minister for Immigration:\u00a0Chancellor Ryden Greyiron Minister of Foreign Affairs:\u00a0Chancellor Ryden Greyiron Minister of The Arts:\u00a0Ganymede Galaii Minister of Internal Affairs:\u00a0Madame Naoki Minister of Primary Industries: Robert Fletcher Minister of Finance: Empress Naoki Minister of Magic: Not AppointedMilitary\u00a0Representatives:The High General: Not AppointedThe High Admiral:\u00a0Admiral Valerian Kastimeer The High Commodore:\u00a0Commodore Elizabeth Finch Regional Rulers:Sakand: @fairuz The Duchy of Meridian: Countess Camilla Blake The Norkari Mountains:\u00a0Enlidil The Winterlands:\u00a0Lord Crovan of House Winter The Steelscape:\u00a0Archlord Astaroth Observers:Head of The Black Tower:\u00a0Lord Tristian Seryl High Marshal of The Sun Marshals:\u00a0Alden Marshal If interested in becoming a part of Isra's Government, contact Madame Naoki.
