{"post-3564": {"user": "Isra - The Free City", "user_num": 255, "timestamp": "1433369434000", "message": "Military\u00a0Field-Marshal: Ildesias Xen Torsal (current).Total NPC Points: 36,000 (number of active characters multiplied by 1000).\u00a0The military of The Free City comprises all officially employed soldiers, adventurers and citizens whose jobs include working as part of the organized structure of The Free City's military. Though under the final command of the Lord, they are led on a day-to-day basis by the Field Marshal - who is in charge of organization, logistics, supplies and making sure the job gets done. Organization of the military is based upon a system of military hierarchy and all active members of the military are well trained and expected to care for their own equipment.\u00a0Military structure is roughly as followed: 10 soldiers form a squad led by a sergeant; 5 squads form a platoon led by a liutenant; 2 platoons form a company led by a Captain, resulting in a company manpower of 100 soldiers. Additionally, five companies are often banded together into a single unit known as a Battle Group, led usually by a Knight (short for Knight-Captain), while two Battle Groups are finally joined together as a single organization known as a division, which is led by a Knight-Commander. Each division, comprising of roughly 1000 soldiers, come together to make a Legion capable of full autonomy in a state of war and are led by a General. Any higher level of organization, such as when two different legions join together as one, is known simply as an army and led by the senior of the two generals, though both the Field Marshal and Lord have the ability to personally lead an army as a sole commander. \u00a0Organization of a LegionThe make-up of an individual Legion roughly follows (and is advised to follow) this guideline:\u00a0A legion is comprised of,\u00a0Total: 3000npc points and whatever those points can afford. (More points per legion can be allocated based on characters active in a particular legion)The cost of different troop types for an army is as followed:\"Cavalry - 3 NPCsSmall Siege Equipment(portable ballistae, small catapults, etc.) - 5 NPCsLarge Siege Equipment and creatures (trebuchet, elephant, troll, etc.) - 20 NPCsMages (very ordinary, low-powered magic using NPCs - 20 NPCsGreat Beasts (dragon, wyrm, wyvern, etc.) - 100 NPCs.\"Therefore, a legion should choose to focus on a specific role in order to maximize effectiveness in one area, rather than attempting to be a catch-all force. It is recommended that at least half of a legion's available troop points should be used to fit that legion's chosen speciality, while the remaining (or preferably as few as possible) are used to support the main bulk.\u00a0For example, a cavalry-focused legion might choose to spend 600 troop points to gain 200 heavy cavalry, while the remaining 400 are used for infantry to support those cavalry in melee. For another example, a legion specializing in attacking a fortification might choose to use 800 troop points on infantry, while the remaining 200 are used on siege weapons.Of course, actual make-up of a legion can vary and not included are sub-categories such as light/heavy infantry.\u00a0Active LegionsFirst Legion, the \"Citadel Guard\":\u00a0Led by Ildesias until a replacement is found.

If you are interested in leading a legion, PM The Free City or speak to Ildesias Xen Torsal in character. If chosen to lead one, you will be asked to make a post here specifically describing your legion and its make-up of soldiers and officers. You are allowed to choose a legion name and customize them to your liking within certain limits. If you would like to join a legion but not lead one, contact the general of that legion. \u00a0------------First Legion, the Citadel Guard.The Citadel Guard is a legion comprised of a thousand well-trained and highly-equipped soldiers. Considered an elite force tasked with the protection of the Free City's Citadel, this legion specializes in defending fortifications and keeping the enemy at bay; no matter what.Appearance and Common EquipmentThe Citadel Guard wields the flag of the Free City as its legion standard, while all armour worn by the soldiers of this legion is glazed a maroon red with the symbol of their freedom, a golden sun, painted on the chest.Troop BreakdownThe Citadel Guard is comprised of ten 100-man companies. Each company is outfitted and trained to play the part of a specific type of soldier as outlined by Ildesias' guide on military organization.Company I: In a siege, the first company is tasked with holding the gate. Equipped with heavy plate armour and close-helms made of steel, this company is split into two platoons. The first platoon wields long-spears and large, crest-shaped shields with a spiked mace as a secondary weapon; tasked with holding the front line behind the gate. The second platoon acts as a support for the first; twenty five soldiers wield heavy crossbows that fire steel bolts, while the remaining twenty five wield shields but forgo long spears for shorter ones, though all fifty men of the second platoon wield the same spiked mace as a secondary option.Company II through to VII: These six companies share a single duty: defend the walls. As such, they are equipped the same and use the same tactics. Each company is designated a different section of the wall to guard, at which point each company is further separated into two platoons of fifty. The first platoons, the ranged combatants, wear a medium armour consisting of riveted steel chain-mail underneath a vest of brigandine plate, with splintered-mail greaves and bracers with leather gloves. These platoons wield crossbows that fire steel bolts and a steel thrusting sword. The second platoons wear similar armour, however are more outfitted for close combat with steel plate pauldrons to protect the shoulders/armpits and an unclosed plate helmet; these wield short thrusting spears, medium-sized round shields and steel swords.\u00a0Company VIII: The first support company, consisting of primarily of younger and more untested knights. They wield a lighter variation of the full plate armour worn by the first company and in battle wield a crest-shield and longsword with a secondary mace.\u00a0Company IX: The second support company, tasked with acting as a shock unit to counter-attack any gains made by the enemy. They wear a medium-heavy armour consisting of chainmail and brigandine plate similar to half the II-VII companies, but have a little more protection in the form of steel close-helms and plate gauntlets and boots. Additionally, they have a small shield mounted on their left bracer, giving them some of the protection of a shield without needing to use one of their hands. The IX Company wield three weapons to battle: a sword for each hand as secondary weapons and, for a primary, a choice between a two-handed battleaxe or a spiked flail.Company X: The tenth company consists two distinct platoons; the first includes the fifty engineers trained to maintain and use defensive weapons such as ballistae. The engineers wear brigandine armour and leather and generally wield a blade, axe or hammer if they get involved in close quarters combat. The second platoon consists of fifty soldiers whose job is to guard them. These guards share the same equipment as their melee-focused brethren from companies II - VII.\u00a0Essentially, the Citadel Guard consists of: 275 heavy infantry, 350 medium infantry, 300 medium archers, 50 engineers and 25 heavy archers,Troop Archetypes and ArtworkIsranian KnightIsranian Spearman.Isranian SwordsmanIsranian LongbowmanIsranian CrossbowmanIsranian Outrider/Scout", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/post/20277/thread", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/post/20278/thread", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/post/20254/thread", ""], "image_list": ["http://oi67.tinypic.com/15d068n.jpg", "http://i.imgur.com/PVLzgaM.jpg", "http://i.imgur.com/LfEZdsN.jpg", "http://i.imgur.com/qDAxRfm.jpg", "http://i.imgur.com/GwyDFur.jpg", "http://i.imgur.com/D2qur1d.jpg", "http://i.imgur.com/y5r8qY4.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><b><font size=\"5\">Military\u00a0</font></b></div>"}, "post-20254": {"user": "Grandma", "user_num": 602, "timestamp": "1451703370000", "message": "I'd like to make the Eleventh Company be the following:Heavy Golems x 20  (20 NPC points), Mages x 20 (20 NPC points), Artillery Golems x 40 (20 NPC points), Dwarven defenders x 200 (3 NPC points), Dwarven Berserkers x 250 (3 NPC points), Mage on Griffin x 1 (50 NPC points)", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "I'd like to make the Eleventh Company be the following:"}, "post-20277": {"user": "Isra - The Free City", "user_num": 255, "timestamp": "1451746347000", "message": "Legion II, \"The Vanguard\".The Vanguards comprise a legion of cavalry and horse-mounted warriors, nicknamed as such because of the vanguard position they would fulfil in war.\u00a0The Vanguards are made up of:200 Isranian Mounted Heavy Knights.
