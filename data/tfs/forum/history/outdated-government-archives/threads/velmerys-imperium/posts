Explorers of old have erected the foundations that have been the seat of the once mighty Velmerys Imperium, now a shadow of its former glory. Three noble houses were erected in the land, House Velmerys the largest and strongest. Velmerys, after some time, conquered the other two houses through a long and arduous war.After House Eoflek\u00a0and Karthuun were demolished, Velmerys set its sights upon the rest of the continent. It spread far from its origin in the North, these lands breaking off from the Imperium, as they were too far away to govern efficiently. This marked the steady decline of the Imperium, as it lost more and more of its holdings as the test of time wore on them.\u00a0\u00a0Now, a new regent\u00a0of House Velmerys, Queen Velmerys, rules. She has spoken clearly of her intentions to bring back the might of the Imperium, woe to those that would dare stand in the way of its Legions.\u00a0Culture and PeopleThe people of the Imperium have a strong nationalistic pride for Velmerys, yet are unsupportive of the magic upper class. Since Velmerys was founded and is ruled by mages, it is only natural that this remains. Most who aren't within the city of Velmerys farm the land to support the Imperium.The Mage upper class has got life within the Imperium easy. Those born with magic excel their families standings, and are sent to the University, to learn of their innate\u00a0gifts. These mages are heads of their own houses within the Imperium, holding standing in the Queen's court.\u00a0The major Houses of Velmerys are many, yet few in the same. These Houses comprise the command of the Imperium's legions and some of its fighting squadrons.Within the Imperium, all worship one God. Korvis, God of All. This God can be interpreted in many ways, and there are too many folklores to keep track of. Though, the most popular legend is that Korvis was the original King of the Velmerys Imperium.\u00a0EconomyThe proud men and women of Velmerys would never admit to an outsider that the Imperium has fallen on hard times. Many mining colonies dot the mountain behind Velmerys, raking in the materials for the Imperium. Farmers tow their\u00a0fields for the Imperium, and sailors conscripted by the Imperium raid other cargo ships, all for the gain of Velmerys.WarfareThe Legions of Velmerys are small but skilled. Though the standing army only consists of five cohorts, the peasantry can be called upon to fill in the ranks.Mages are within the Imperium's deck of cards, though those that are sent to war are usually in command of the Cohort, and do not take active parts in the fighting of battle.The Velmerys Legions are, when called to war, led by Queen or King Velmerys. The fear of disgrace before their royalty makes them fight much harder.\"Not For Self, But For Velmerys.\"The highly trained and disciplined Cohorts of Velmerys utilize half-plate armor, and rows upon rows of halberds, to oppose cavalry. They are a country lacking in a noble cavalry and have found ways to oppose the charge. The pikemen carry a pike and shield, and a shortsword to fall back upon.Behind the rows, and to break up opposing pikes formations, is the two-handed sword. These men are equipped with half-plate as well, but their weapons alter very much from the pikemen. Given a six-foot sword, and double pay, these men are the spine of the Cohorts.\u00a0The cohorts wear the colors of whatever noble leads them, the Royal Cohort wearing the black and red of the Imperial Banner.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://img00.deviantart.net/f59c/i/2017/362/1/a/fantasy_city_by_jbrown67-dby6t2e.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img00.deviantart.net/f59c/i/2017/362/1/a/fantasy_city_by_jbrown67-dby6t2e.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/>"}, "post-88907": {"user": "Velmerys Imperium", "user_num": 3067, "timestamp": "1548485030000", "message": "The Royal LegionThe Royal Legion of Her Majesty Belestrasza Velmerys.
