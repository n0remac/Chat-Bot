Some of them have chosen to stay, and live in Isra, and that\u2019s excellent. However, for the census and recordkeeping, I need to keep track of just who all is residing in Isra, and in this case, I would like to ask for a bit of assistance in that regard.If any character(s) of yours have recently moved to Isra, perhaps to stay after the festival, have chosen to make Isra their base of operations for adventuring, or have just evaded my notice up until this point, I would like to know, and I would like you to tell me.This is for Isra\u2019s character list and is synonymous with the list of Isra\u2019s citizens. The term 'citizens' is used loosely because it includes NPC accounts, wild beasts, cute tentacle demons, and other such things, but it\u2019s essentially any character who lives in Isra and isn\u2019t actively being an enemy of the state.Citizenship is required in Isra to own land, buy and sell goods, and live in the city for an extended length of time, among other things. Read more about the citizenship process and Isra\u2019s laws here.Below is a list of characters that are already recorded to be citizens, who have also posted within the last thirty days. (Display names may be out of date or spelled incorrectly.) It does not include characters in Meridian or Sakand. The full listing is here, on The Glorious Spreadsheet.If you have a character that should be added, or know of a character that you think should be added, mention them here, please.

The Free City of Isra was founded upon the ideals of being free and open and such. It has accepted several large batches of refugees. Unless there's something terribly wrong with you such as a complete unwillingness to fill out some paperwork, or you practice horrible death magic in your spare time, there is no reason you wouldn't be allowed to live in Isra.", "link_list": ["/post/65733/thread"], "image_list": ["//storage.proboards.com/6046952/images/uCQvKjMwQCSfGa7d4dCT.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@adamarwysaren\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/65733/thread\" timestamp=\"1494196470\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-0\" title=\"adamarwysaren\"><img alt=\"adamarwysaren Avatar\" src=\"//storage.proboards.com/6046952/images/uCQvKjMwQCSfGa7d4dCT.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/65733/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1494196470000\" title=\"May 7, 2017 14:34:30 GMT -8\">May 7, 2017 14:34:30 GMT -8</abbr></a>  @adamarwysaren said:</div>I arrived into Isra, trying to move in.
