I was hoping to do this by giving the players holding IC ranks the ability to customize and detail their own little parts of the state. For instance, the Arch-Mage can decide what magic state magicians specialize in, or the generals of legions can customize the legions they lead.Anyway!

I was hoping that rather than me just deciding everything, you take the lead in how you want to do things and I work in a supportive role to help you accomplish those things. For instance, if you feel you need more men, you could approach Ildesias about it and he'd try to sort something about. Or we could just do it OOCly, I don't mind. That's generally the gist of what I'm trying to get at, though. There are a couple of questions for you, though: would the wardens work directly as part of the military, or as a separate but affiliated organization more akin to state intelligence? If not part of the military, you're pretty much given free reign to organize the wardens how you want - so you could recruit men for the service and send them out on missions, customize their equipment and so on, like Leliana in Dragon Age Inquisition. So basically, do what you think is best.  It would be cool if you created a post describing and outlining the wardens, though! Perhaps in the military thread (even though they're probably not officially part of it)?As for narcotics and hallucinogens, there's no Justice Secretary yet to kind of outlaw these things or work on the laws of the realm, so I say go ahead as long as they're not dangerous and it's done in a smoke room.
