Due to their poor intelligence, most weapons used are crude but very versatile. Most of his group is Kiggies, but some other species are allowed to join, namely kobolds, gnolls, goblins, and orcs.\u00a0Little bit of lore: since they are built fairly agile, flexible and small the excel at filling the role of light infantry, skirmishers, shock troops and infiltration. While normally front line troops consist of males, to these kiggies gender doesn't matter. If you can rip a man's spleen or arm in half, generally you can fight. Although males almost always out number females due to most of them being baby machines back at home.  Honor guards have a high chance of females, due to usually a less direct combat role. Their only major flaw is they can completely forget tactics and simply go into a blind bloodlust, only seeking to kill their opponent.Units: (Unit section for NPCs is to be redone and adjusted soon.)Hunters - standard fast light infantry and primary bulk of the Hunting Legion, various weapons at disposal; mainly spears, falchions, and axes, minimal leather or cloth armor, low morale \u00a0- 1 NPC pointStones - more elite and well trained units and more organized, each has proper quality light armor of leather, some mail, and cloth and a shield, armed with better crafted spears, swords and axes, above average morale - 2 NPC pointsPigstickers - standard ranged unit, armed with war darts or javelins to bombard an enemy with unique weapons and always armed with a cheap backup melee weapon. Poisons, diseased heads, feces, torches etc, all used to damage an enemy of long periods of time, dressed in crude light armor, average morale - 1 NPC pointCorpse carvers - highest ranking of front line infantry, covers speed, range, and damage. Armed with the weaponry of both Pigstickers and Stones, they are the versatile light infantry packed with much experience and skill in good quality medium armor, very high morale - 3 NPC pointsHigh guard - generally older, veteran units are awarded to being praised as such noble fighters they reside within a commander's home or palace and protect them from all harm possible. 50:50 male to female ratio. Armed with the finest medium armor available and Spears crafted to perfection with dual blades forged in the lands very own lava flows. Death comes before defeat, Very extreme morale - 4 NPC points'Siege'-yars - Whatever happened here is anyone's guess. These massive versions of the their brethren stand almost 3 times their normal size at 14 feet tall. As usual because of their massive size and strength they get outfitted with heavier and better armor and weapons. With spears the size of small trees and crossbows almost matching ballistae in firepower, these are lethal at any distance. Very high morale. - 15 NPC pointsDa Engies: Usually goblins and the smarter ones of the kiggies and gnolls, these are the specialists of the Legion. They have magic grenades of poison and fire, but a weak melee weapon and mediocre armor. When not chucking rune bombs at enemies, they operate in teams of three or four to carry and assemble siege scorpions where ever they are needed. One carries the firing frame and a spear, the other carries the stand and a shield, the third hauls the ammo, another spear, and helps assemble and disassemble the weapon. - 12 NPC points per team of 3, 4 points per bodyRunnin' Ridars: The only and main cavalry of the legion, they ride (WIP)Shamanz:Hunting Legion status: 300 NPC points to spendHunters: 80 troops, 1 units of 80 (80 NPC points)Stones: 50 troops, 2 units of 25 (100 NPC points)Pig Stickers: 80 troops, 2 units of 40 (80 NPC points)Corpse Carvers: n/aHigh Guard: n/aSiege-yars: 2 troops (30 NPC points) n/aDa Engies: 5 scorpions, 15 troops (60 NPC points) n/aRunnin' Ridars: n/aShamanz: 4 troops (40 NPC points)300 spent total((To be redone and changed again.))", "link_list": ["/user/710", "/user/722", "/user/733"], "image_list": [], "html": "Accounts: "}, "post-28219": {"user": "Legion Master Zhax", "user_num": 710, "timestamp": "1457709725000", "message": "How to join:It's simple, but first here are some recommended properties or specs of your character.Evil/Neutral - we will be murdering people and stealing stuff, so a goody two shoes wouldn't really fit in here.Chaotic/Neutral - \"fuck the police\" see above ^Race/species - anything is allowed, but to maximize your chances I'd recommend making a kobold, gnoll, kiggy or a goblin.Gender - no body gives a flying fook about gender, if you can strike down a man or beast, you're good (Male is generally slightly more common)Skillset/role - once again, anything is allowed, but it is recommended you create a combat or support (doctors/shamans, bards, blacksmiths and prostitutes all count!) type character (prefered spearmen, swordsmen, rouges/scouts, archers and low power mages) LOOKING FOR ROUGES/SCOUTS AND MAGESHow to join IC?
