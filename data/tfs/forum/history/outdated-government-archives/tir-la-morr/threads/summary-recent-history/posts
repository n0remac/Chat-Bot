The Court of Winter ruled in the north by a dark Queen as harsh and cruel as her lands. The Unseelie fae delighted in malicious tricks and sinister machinations. To the south, The Court of Summer held sway ruled by a King as bright and mischievous as a warm summer breeze. For aeons, the courts ruled an uneasy peace between their lands only held in place as neither had cared to build armies and march on the other, which is why they fell.No one knows where The Tyrant in Gold came from or how he amassed so much power. No one even knows his name for the creature never gave it. All he gave was fire and blood, metal and death. A red swath of death was sprayed onto the snow of Winter, unprepared for a war even the harsh and deadly Unseelie could not beat back The Tyrant's army. The Old Queen of Winter stood defiantly against The Tyrant in her throne room when he came, join or die, that was the ultimatum she was given. On the darkest night of Winter, a Queen\u2019s head rolled.The Court of Summer had time to prepare unlike Winter but it did not avail them. When The Tyrant of Gold came to Summer Halls those who stood in his way spilled enough blood to water their verdant fields. When at last The old King of Summer stood between The Tyrant and his goals the mirthful soul bereaved with the loss but certain that it would pass just as the winter season does capitulated to the new crown. Two Courts were brought to heel and The Tyrant declared there was no Fae above him, no Sidhe his equal. That his domain was that of all of Tir la Morr and therefore there was to be only one true court, The Court of Gold. It imposed order upon the fairy lands were once there was none, splitting the lands of Winter and Summer and granting them to new houses of Spring and Autumn. The four lesser courts were made to do his will.Tir la Morr now has more in common with a human kingdom than it did with the once wild place it was but don\u2019t be fooled. It is still dangerous to visit these lands, so rife with old creatures and ancient magic. However, within the wild woods and new towns, there is just as much opportunity as there is danger.
