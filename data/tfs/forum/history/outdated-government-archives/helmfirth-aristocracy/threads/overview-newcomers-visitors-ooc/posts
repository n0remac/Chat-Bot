No guidelines without having to flag down the owner and sit with pen and paper to ensure all the details are followed and aren't missed. So I figured I would try to place the mold here where everyone looking for information on Helmfirth could find it.Helmfirth is, by no secret, a dark fantasy themed place in one aspect or another. The island is, quite frankly, split in two - the dividing line being the dense string of forest following the main river from the mountains to the shores at the other side. The southern half is bad man central at Alnwick and that's no secret either. It's renowned as a pirate port and city.The open southern lands are more self-retained order and peaceful - lots of farms and towns where people try to do better. Namely, people that have been of Erstonia for some time rather than newcomers that settled Alnwick.Mythological critters (griffins, basilisks, demon creatures, harpies) generally don't show up in Erstonia save in the deeper forests or the higher mountains, and become more frequent and more deadly and bigger towards Strathmore.But game is in the temperate areas of Erstonia - deer and rabbit and horses, bears in the forests, lions in the mountains.Strathmore territory is not dead. Despite the greying setting, things are not entirely dead across the boards. It's an effect due to the darkening magics that have been in place for so many years - it has effected the terrain and wildlife.Humans are not spotted in an instance and arrested or assaulted - that's pretty cheating. Humans are as much a common factor in Helmfirth as the non-humans. Granted they are normally servants and slaves within Airedale, and one wandering without their master rouses suspicion in time. But this doesn't mean that a human character that makes it to Airedale will walk up to the gates and be immediately seen as human and arrested.Common denizens of Airedale?-Humans, Elves, and even some Centaurs and Fae are generally enslaved races with few exceptions.-The races considered normal class and above the slaves are generally anything proven to be different, better, stronger, or more magically inclined than humanoids.-The aristocracy is made up of all sorts of races, too, and generally hold more slaves since they can afford it-The Covenant is made up of currently:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1 Vampire\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2 Arache\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1 Merman\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1 Werewolf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1 Balkekin\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1 Harpy\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1 Undead... necromancer... something\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1 open position-The high class forge master is a MinotaurIf you have any questions that you would like answered, PM this account please.
