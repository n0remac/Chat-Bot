It's actually known by most Airedalian folk that the less flesh on them, the more experienced and powerful they are. And that's not accounting for any armor and weapons carried on their persons. The upside to these warriors compared to their living relatives is the lack of pain and drawbacks of blood loss. It makes them a certain degree more resilient in a battle, though there's little to be had if they lose a limb. Not every soldier knows how to realign joints, and can't really repair broken bones. Though it's not beneath them to use said limbs as weapons.SpearSword/shieldWarhammerScythe wieldersMaces/clubsWhatever they can find...BowmenWarped beings of the bog and forest that have been convinced and bought out for Airedale's forces, these dryad creatures have been tainted by the lack of sunlight and the dark magic that hums everywhere via the Blotch that hangs over the land. Despite their brittle-looking forms, they are still hard and strong - in addition to being able to create their own weapons at will from their very bodies and the earth itself. It is with this ability that they have become the deadliest archers and crossbowmen in the realm - their weapons and arrow and bolts wrought on the spot from each other and from themselves, and made with rough and jagged points to cause the most pain and suffering before falling their enemies.ArchersCrossbowmenSlingersMounted Units\u00a0 The foot soldiers become something more menacing when they are no longer on foot - namely, mounted on a spectre steed or an undead Pegasus unit. Neither are something one generally wants to come across at any point as they are vicious animals that are notorious for biting and kicking at just about anything with a heartbeat. It takes serious training to control one and more to ride it, and that makes these even more deadly units to engage in battle. Much like living horses have different color hides and hair, the differences come in the color of the auras and the hides ranging from a dead grey to a pitch black - save for the flyers, as there's not a hair left save for the mangy tail or mane. Another point that makes these creatures all the more terrifying is the aura they emit - which naturally dampens and suppresses magics in their immediate vicinity... which makes it difficult to take these things out of existence via banishment.Dogs of War\u00a0 \u00a0 A grand idea of a royal line from when Lord Alexander Maximilien Frederica first pulled the Covenant together to form the first circle to rule - something grander than a regular dog. And far more vicious in nature. These beasts of three varieties are bred and trained for a number of tasks, from hunting to breeding to household pets - and most certainly for battle.- The Hellhound (left) is no different from beasts of lore - fiery monsters brought from the depths of hell itself... or at least, these are notoriously brought up from molten lava springs somewhere within Helmfirth's lands. They spit bursts of fire and will scorch earth that their paws touch, as well as cause severe burning to whatever is unlucky enough to be bitten by one. In addition, they are physically as strong as some of the largest breeds of dogs, some even tougher - a very select few bred and raised to be as big as a man and able to topple a horse with it's own body.- The dead mutt (center) isn't called a particular name, having replaced the standard dog in Helmfirth for the common household pet and companion, the hunting dog, sheep dog, etc. etc. Their life span is also determined by the amount or flesh/fur still on their bones - the less on their skeleton, the older the breed. Despite what they are taken for, each one seems to hold the same ability to infect upon biting - sometimes general bacteria that infects the wound, and sometimes with a potent poison to cause rapid deterioration of whatever is bitten; whatever gets caught in their teeth is likely to rot and die within hours.- The Icedogge [ee-seh-d\u014dg] (right) doesn't need the size of the fiery brethren. These frigid dogs are fast and agile, with tense jaws that refuse to release once something is caught in their teeth. Their hide is more plated and hard rather than flesh or fur. They leave a touch of frostbite beneath their paws, and their bite does the same thing - and is quite toxic if any of their infested saliva manages to get into flesh or the bloodstream. There's nothing but a painful death at the end of such a predicament.The WarlocksNo one really knows who or what these are, save for their very aura humming with arcana. It's almost as if they are constructed of magic themselves. But whatever the case, and whatever lies beneath the ominous cloaks and hoods - it's dangerous and expels a heavy array of magical knowledge to destroy... and even raise the dead. They hail first and foremost from The Dark Matter Spire in Airedale, and it's clear why these are the pride and joy of Aleister Crowley            and are his most promising and prized students. And why these are standard guardians of his tower.The JuggernautDespite the dull, dim-witted marionette appearance of these constructs - they are destructive and dangerous to encounter. Almost everything of this beast is wrought solidly of petrified wood save for the torso and massive orb of a head being hollow. Granted, while these parts are hollow they are by no means thin in the walls. The head is said to house a warlock inside, working the construct from the inside with clear vision via the round, orbish eyes on the head or the \"nasal\" slits in the front - yet no one can see inside the head from the outside, only an infinite darkness. Also, known to be seated in the torso are enslaved and chained Elven kind that have been around for no less than a hundred years - it's from their own blood and magical affinity that fuels the juggernaut, so to speak. This allows a double magic source to not only bring the creature to life but also to channel offensive magicks against enemies. And if this wasn't enough, these giant suits - standing easily at 30-40 feet tall and weighing several tons - are carefully maintained to ensure they are steadfast against a number of conditions. Their rough surfaces are polished to help resist water and fire damage.The juggernaut units have their forearms hollowed out for specific use - either to channel out magicks in a blasted, almost laser-pointed form, or equipped with a heavy, deadly sharp spike used to completely skewer the opposition. It's not uncommon to see these things miraculously breathe fire from said openings or from their \"face\", as well as blistering water and steam or corrosive acids. Some have seen the Dryads clamber onto the heads and arms, and root - becoming additional \"turrets\" on this already deadly contraption. And there are a select few units that are further hollowed out - and used to tear through enemy forces to drop reinforcements in the back of enemy ranks.The use of the juggernaut is grand and expansive.", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/2746/uptown-dark-matter-spire", "/user/2271"], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/jjELZcA.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/ns92DtI.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/dG8qBegl.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/cRyg6Wr.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/arg9H0i.png", "https://i.imgur.com/1xVWYJH.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/VoEbDac.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/krRCz0T.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/H75MBEV.jpg"], "html": "<i>Point counts will be updated in due time</i>"}}
