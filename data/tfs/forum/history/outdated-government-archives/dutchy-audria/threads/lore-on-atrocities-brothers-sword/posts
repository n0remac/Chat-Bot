a warning that, should we ever denounce the Angelists, we'd receive a similar fate.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Written by an unknown author, presumably a Wickan of Eastwick, shortly after the success of the Eastern Crusade."}, "post-12274": {"user": "Father Wolfgang 'the Mace'", "user_num": 674, "timestamp": "1443653628000", "message": "Written by the most well-known priest of the order, Wolfgang von Straut.A letter written to the Vessian Emperor during the waning years of the Wickan Crusade.It has come to my attention that reports leaked into your council of 'atrocities' in Eastwick.\u00a0 I, Father Wolfgang von Straut, fellow Vessian and close adviser to our Hochmeister, outright deny such acts.Let us not forget it was the Wickans who waged war on the Angelists.\u00a0 Let us not forget the burning of our men as they sacrificed them to their gods.\u00a0 Let us not forget the raids which claimed the lives of hundreds of our own folk.\u00a0 Never forget why the great Konrad formed the Brothers in the first place: to protect the Angelists.I am sure we all know of the behavior the invaluable Dietrich can possess, but to let such a madman stand for the order?\u00a0 Preposterous.\u00a0 For relief, look to up and coming hero Adrian von Heschburg, a candidate for komtur.\u00a0 Adrian was attacked by a ferocious band of Wickan brutes on one night and held them off with valiant effort.\u00a0 Come morning, Adrian led his troops to the nearby village, where the brutes took refuge after their skirmish, and bid them present themselves.\u00a0 Fearing their families would die and their homes burned to cinder, the men came out and surrendered.\u00a0 Prepared to meet death, the men prayed to their gods, but received no death.\u00a0 Rather, Adrian had them relocated further towards Vessia, where they were given land, better homes, and placed on a route where trade was flourishing.\u00a0 In this way, Adrian converted these men not to Angelism, but to honesty.\u00a0 They could not rise in revolt, for they were under the watchful eye of a garrison in their new lands.\u00a0 It was this act of courage, nobility, and charity that Konrad gave me the go ahead for Adrian's title of komtur.\u00a0 He shall make an excellent diplomat.My question is, if it is we who commit 'atrocities', then what word could possibly describe the Wickans?", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Written by the most well-known priest of the order, Wolfgang von Straut."}}
