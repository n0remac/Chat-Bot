Knights who understand the value of family, who understand love, who understand peace and war.\u00a0 Knights who would otherwise be living peaceful lives, governing their lands with good hearts.Most of my fellow Brothers were veterans of the Phaerocian Wars, or their sons.\u00a0 They knew full well what they'd be getting into.\u00a0 They had seen the brutality of war, the chaos and destruction it spreads.Wickan radicals have always raided the eastern Vessian Frontier, it is geographically logical.\u00a0 But when some of the Wickans began to adopt Angelism, the Wickans had renewed purposes to raid Vessia.\u00a0 Wickans are known to be extreme radicals, who worship pagan gods, often burning their prisoners to the stake as sacrifices.\u00a0 When they learned their own kind had turned away from their gods, they began to execute them with extreme prejudice.\u00a0 Perhaps it was the thrill of sacrificing us Angelists that led to increased raids in eastern Vessia.\u00a0 Whatever the case, it became more and more frequent, and it was apparent the Wickans were seeking Angelists specifically.The final straw for myself was when my sister and mother were counted among the casualties.Enraged, I drew up my closest friends, all Knights of Vessia, and sought the approval of our sovereign, the Emperor.\u00a0 The Emperor, and the High King of Asgeir even, granted me rights to rescue our kin.\u00a0 I drew the support of many more knights and volunteers, even clergymen of Angelism.\u00a0 The purpose of my order was three-pronged:1.\u00a0 Rescue captured Vessians, Varan, and other Angelists2.\u00a0 Quell the Wickan Raiding parties plaguing eastern Vessia3.\u00a0 Maintain order in the pacified areas (preventing future conflicts)Many villages dot Eastwick, and these were our targets.\u00a0 But first, we needed to deal with main Wickan war party, which had gathered in Arburg, a keep formerly belonging to Vessia.\u00a0 After routing the forces there, I sent my armies east and southeast to the villages.\u00a0 There we rescued scores of captives, returning them to their families back in Vessia and Asgeir, or accepting them into our order.\u00a0 This, of course, drew the ire of many Wickans.My Brothers suffered heavy casualties part way through the crusade.\u00a0 Wickan skirmishers bolted out of their forests, slaughtering hundreds of men at a time before vanishing back into the woods.\u00a0 These were the same men who raided and pillaged our lands in Vessia.\u00a0 It was obvious these men came from the villages, and so that is where we went.\u00a0 Unfortunately, it is hard to tell who were the murderers.\u00a0 So we rounded them up and bid they confess.\u00a0 When none did, we executed the ones who owned blood-stained weapons first until the others finally did confess.\u00a0 Those who confessed was sent to pacified areas and asked to denounce their radical ways; failure to do so resulted in a merciful death.\u00a0 Many say that practice was harsh, but to free them only warranted another radical attack in the future, and to imprison them only served to torture them further - which is immoral.As the women and children were often left by their lonesome after such events, they were offered new lands in pacified areas.\u00a0 Those who accepted were given homes and farmland, where they lived in absolute peace under the watchful eye of their Teutonic protectors.\u00a0 They experienced better living conditions, and was allowed to trade with travelers whom they normally would never have.\u00a0 These people were offered the chance to become Angelists, and a vast majority agreed.As our power and support grew in Eastwick, the Grand Duke finally submitted and surrendered.\u00a0 To ensure his word was law, he openly converted to Angelism.\u00a0 After news of this spread, the Wickans became pacified and the crusade was complete.Dietrich, my good friend, is another figment of negativity.\u00a0 Dietrich is a necessary evil.\u00a0 Although he is a troubled man who suffers from mental issues, Dietrich has always remained loyal to me, and valued our friendship.\u00a0 While the terrible events he suffered in his past have transformed him into a monster, I believe some part of his good self is still in there.\u00a0 Nevertheless, I reserve Dietrich for the less-than-noble deeds that are required.\u00a0 He is the order's personal executioner, and fulfills his duty when needed.\u00a0 He is also the perfect fighter to send into the fray.\u00a0 I cannot count how many times Dietrich has done the impossible; how many of my Brothers he has saved; how many warbands he has halted.\u00a0 It is in this way that I control my deranged friend, at least until I find a way to cure him of his twisted mentality.And so when one accuses the Brothers of dastardly crimes, know this: the order exists to serve the greater good; to heal the sick and injured; to care for the orphans of war; to ultimately make the world a better place.\u00a0 If you're against such noble deeds, then quite frankly, you're on the side of evil.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "An article written by Hochmeister Konrad IV von Marshburg, on the apparent 'atrocities' the order is commonly accused of."}}
