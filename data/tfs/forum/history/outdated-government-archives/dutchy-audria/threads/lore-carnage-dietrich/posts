One-thousand and ninety... six?\"\"Y-y-y-yes milord.\"Dietrich was a tall fellow, slimmer than most men his height, but still rather strong.  His servant, a lowly man with obvious physical ailments, watched him in earnest.  A pitiful man of unknown origin was on his knees, his head over a chopping block, as he wept feverishly.\"Hyn-yah!\"  The massive executioner's sword in Dietrich's hand came down and sliced the man's head clean off.  \"Woo!  Yeah!\"  Blood had spattered upon Dietrich's robes and onto the servant, who covered his face.  \"Stop cowering, you fool,\" Dietrich teased, \"taste the blood, drink it!\"Dietrich reared back, tired from killing so many people in one day.  \"Ah... that's all of them then?\"\"Y-y-y-yes sir, I think so.  No more prisoners, sir, no sir.\"\"Ah, it's a shame.\"  Dietrich snorted and spat upon a pile of bodies to the side.  \"Konrad best be sending some more infidels this way.  In the name of More Holier.\"\"Most Holy, mi'lord.\"\"What?  Ah, right, Most Holy, the scumbag.  I don't see why Konrad worships such a man of belittling stature.  He died didn't he?  Crucified?\"\"Indeed, sir.\"\"Weak.  Pathetic.  And Konrad follows him, pfft.  But... he is my friend... and for that I shall not criticize him.. openly!\"  Dietrich bursts out in heinous laughter as he tosses his blade over to the servant.  \"Clean that, then sharpen it.  And feed these bodies to the wolves.

He had been campaigning in the area for some time and made some relative easy successes.

But I'm doing what I think needs to be done, and that's helping people in whatever way I can.  And I'm here... to help you.  I just ask that you return the charity in the future.\"The Wickans began to cry and wept with joy at Adrian's compromise.  It seemed all had been set.\"Hyn-yagh!\"  Bursting from the wooded path came a horde of horsemen donned in white cloaks and black crosses.  It was Adrian's 'relief force', led by the unforgiving Dietrich.  He and his fellow knights charged full-speed towards the congregation of Wickans and Swordbrothers.  \"Die, you dogs,\" he commanded.\"Dietrich!  No!\"  Adrian was forced to leap out of the way, grabbing the arm of a nearby Wickan girl and dragging her with him.  \"Keep your head down,\" he told her.\u00a0 He got up and helplessly watched the merciless charge.The mass of Wickan prisoners cried out and scrambled, but Dietrich's cavalry mercilessly trampled them, riding them down and cutting them with their swords.  \"Out of the way, Adrian, I can take it from here!\"\"You fool!  They're prisoners!  They've surrendered!\"  Adrian's words meant nothing as the Sadist rode the pagan folk down, slaughtering them by the dozen.Within minutes only a few stragglers had made it into the woods, out of sight of the charging knights.  Adrian angrily made his way over to one of Dietrich's knights.  \"You bastards!  What have you done!\"  What Adrian expected to be a standoff between both companies of knights didn't exactly happen.  Rather, he could hear the rattling of the knight's armor.The OrdenMarschall, Dietrich von Marsrchburg, had struck so much fear into his knights they shook like leaves before him.\"Leave my men be,\" Dietrich, finished with his charge, came up beside Adrian and the knight, circling them on his horse.  \"You're of a lowly rank, Adrian, and thus below me.  Under my command, these devil-worshipers will feel nothing but the blade.\"\"Pagans.  They're pagans, not devil-worshipers,\" Adrian angrily replied, balling his fist.\"Pfft, all the same to me.  They burn those who don't believe in their gods.  Reason enough for a knight like me self to slaughter them.\"\"You're a butcher, not a knight.  I'll make sure the Hochmeister hears of this you fool!\"  Adrian stormed away, back towards his own weary, battle-worn knights and the young girl he had managed to save.  The whole time, Dietrich laughed horribly.\"Then you're a fool, Adrian.  Konrad ain't never getting rid of me.  I'm to much of an asset.\"\"We'll see,\" whispered Adrian.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"...will be spared, you have my word.\"  Adrian von Heschburg spoke with sincerity to his Wickan captives.
