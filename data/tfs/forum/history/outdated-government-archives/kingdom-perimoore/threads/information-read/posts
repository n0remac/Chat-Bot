The people of Perimoore are simply folk; many are farmers or craftsmen and live long peaceful lives on the lush green plains of this budding empire.  The Stoutcrest family have ruled Perimoore for over two hundred years leading it out of the great famine of the cataclysm which decimated the once much larger population. \u00a0GeographyLandscapeNestled in the north of the continent between Medan, the Free City and the Nokari mountains, The Kingdom of Perimoore is an easily accessible country with long established roads leading southwards towards the Kingdom of Medan. Lying between it and the sea is a large area of unclaimed wildlands which, if ventured across, would bring you close enough to see the island nation of Katashima. Perimoore shares a tenuous border with the Nokari Empire with the near impassable mountains making a rather convincing buffer between the two nations. The large majority of the Kingdom of Perimoore is fertile, rolling grassland, much of which has been reaped and sowed for hundreds of years. There are of course forests, hills, caves and ruins scattered across the countryside, as is the case with most pieces of land this big, but, for the most part, its endless green plains or ploughed fields. Perimoore enjoys warm summers and cool winters with rain being common across the lands. There are various brooks and dykes which allow the flow of water to trickle off the farm land and make its way southwards, downhill towards Medan. The north east of the country is often referred to as the high lands and is blanketed by dense evergreen trees which act as a natural buffer between Perimoore and the Nokari mountains. Running from atop the aforementioned mountain range springs forth the beginnings of Frostfall River, which gets its name from the chucks of ice which often are washed down from the Nokari, leading down into the Crystal Lake situated in the centre of the kingdom.LocationsPerimoore City \u2013 The Capital of the Kingdom and home to Perimoore castle and the royal family. This sprawling city is situated on the banks of the Crystal Lake making it a hive of activity. The city is where many of the rural farmers visit to sell their crops and buy new equipment and supplies. Many of the more, important and richer families call the capital their home and live in large estates close to the castle.Fort Stormshield \u2013 Heavily maned and well-fortified, Fort Stormshield acts as the first line of defence against the unknown forces which dwell within the Nokari mountains. Built on the Frostfall, the fort also houses a small populace outside of the old walls of the fortification and is a popular spot for scout training and adventurers looking for an excursion into the unknown. Brookshire \u2013 The quaint town of Brookshire can be found in the south west of the kingdom close to the Medan border. This beautifully idyllic town has numerous ornate stone walkways and bridges built around and over the handful of natural streams which run through the settlement. Stonefall \u2013 Stonefall is the Bowestone capital of the kingdom and is where the large majority of the unrefined mineral is pulled from the earth. A rough, industrial town, Stonefall offers plenty of work for strong, hard working men looking to earn some gold swinging a pick in the light rain.CultureOverall citizens of the Kingdom of Perimoore are hardworking and light hearted. As with all populations there are acceptations but this is the general attitude across the land. The culture has a strong emphasis on family and the home holding both in high regard. As such there are multiple festivals and holidays across the year to celebrate both aforementioned aspects. As a nation steeped in farming tradition; farmers, their produce and even the land is greatly respected and adored. The harvest is a great occasion for the people of Perimoore and both before and after the years crops are reaped huge festivals are held in both thanks and celebration. These festivals can last days and, especially at the end of the harvest, often include some form of feast or communal meal.Regarding outsiders the people of Perimoore are very welcoming, accepting and understanding of people and races they may not understand. It is not at all uncommon for people to offer a bed or a meal to a lost stranger or someone in need. Most citizens, while highly valuing their home and family, enjoy the tales and stories of outsider\u2019s home lands and far flung places.Refusing aid, insulting a person\u2019s family or home and disrespecting the land are all widely shunned or deemed rude in Perimoore culture. As for the kingdoms take on crime; many punishments fit the crime in the sense that pickpockets have a number of fingers removed based on the cost and seriousness of their offense while liars may have their tongue branded or removed if their crimes are serious enough.Gold coins, the kingdom's currency, are not greatly sort after and are not as widely used as one would expect. Instead, bartering and trading reigns supreme in the outer regions of the land where access to even the basic supplies is sometime sparse. As such many people travel to one of the major settlements to sell their goods and crops for coin when the need arises as these are the main hubs of civilized trade for currency.When marriage occurs the women changes her name to match the mans. There is a long running tradition in Perimoore for dubbing individuals with unofficial titles and suffixes depending on their notable attributes or deeds. Greymane the Stoic for example was giving his title due to his uncanny ability to endure physical and emotional hardships without so much as a flinch.  This practice is common among the guilds and the military as individuals are often named for their great or sometimes not so great, deeds.Regarding Religion the people of Perimoore do believe in a higher power that initially created and shaped the world. They call them \u201cThe Maker\u201d and while there are few official places of worship many citizens offer a quiet prayer before a meal and before bedTrade and Raw MaterialsSurplus ResourcesAs a nation based on agriculture, husbandry and mining, The Kingdom of Perimoore draws many of its strengths in both trade and warfare from the land. Regarding the latter, the Kingdom utilizes a good mixture of light cavalry and Magicka wielding infantry/skirmishers. The sheer number and quality of the Kingdom\u2019s horses allow many horseback soldiers to be fielded even over long, drawn out conflicts. The support and enhancing abilities of Magicka allow the Perimoore military to be quick on the move and versatile, much to their enemy\u2019s surprise. Grain and other farming produce such as fruit and vegetables are plentiful, almost to the point of wasteful, and these goods have long since been the most exported and important trading chip the Kingdom of Perimoore holds. Magicka follows closely behind Farming produce and livestock on the nation\u2019s list of most commonly traded goods, especially to the more magically prominent nations allowing people to wield magic who would otherwise be unable to do so. Scarce ResourcesAs a landlocked country Perimoore has very little fish produce and as such fish, and other edible nautical products, are considered a delicacy eaten sparingly by the Kingdom\u2019s upper echelons . As Bowestone is so widespread and common throughout the earth in Perimoore other metals and minerals especially iron and coal are rare thus making heavy armour a rare commodity indeed. As such only those that can afford the expensive price tag that comes along with hiring one of the few craftsman who actually work with metal get the privilege of being so well protected.  Bowestone and MagickaThe use of Magicka has long been common throughout the Kingdom of Perimoore. The magical stones start their life as Bowestone found underground throughout the Kingdom. Bowestone is an easy to shape, light material which is neither rock, metal or mineral but somewhere between all three. It has a glass like appearance, being translucent with a grey hue which can be seen through when held up to a light. It shapes as if a mineral and has to be ground down to shape with tools tipped with specifically purpose Magicka. It is worn down by wind and rain over time rather quickly making it ill-suited for use as a general building material. Bowestone found naturally in caves and tunnels has a head which looks not to dissimilar to a crystal formation. Beneath it however lays long, tooth-like roots which reach far deeper into the earth anchoring it firmly in place. As such there are two ways to gather Bowestone from the earth; the quick way and the proper way. The quick way entails cutting off the top of the stone leaving the large majority of the Bowestone still hidden in the earth. This is used sparingly to fill big orders but is more commonly used by unsanctioned miners trying to earn some quick gold by essentially stealing the Kingdom's Bowestone. The second method is the most widely used technique and involves digging out around the roots of the stone and cutting it into workable chunks working from the bottom up. Once the Bowestone has been completely extracted the holes are filled and the workers move onto the next vein.Once on the surface the Bowestone takes on a mystical property. During the day it collects and stores the energy from the sun then, at night, it illuminates not to dissimilar from the solar powered lights of the current day. This ability makes it perfect for lamps which can be found on almost every round within the Kingdom making traveling much safer without the veil of night to cover would be criminals. If not being used as a nocturnal light source then Bowestone is taken to one of the handful of Mage\u2019s guild buildings; the biggest and grandest of all being the Mage\u2019s guild headquarters in Perimoore city. Once there the mages begin their mysterious process of cutting, shaping and enchanting the Bowestone into small gem like shapes which the Kingdom commonly refers to as Magicka. Magicka comes in all colours, shapes and sizes but the most commonly seen and utilized variety can be held in the palm of one\u2019s hand. The general rule of thumb is the larger the Magicka the more powerful it is, with the Kingdom\u2019s siege weapons essentially being huge chunks of Magicka on carts. The power, application and number of uses of Magicka is defined by the mage responsible for enchanting the cut Bowestone. Many years ago, this was done by natural mages who infused the Magicka with their own powers; Fire mages would create Magicka which could rain fire from the sky or shoot fireballs at will. Now, with natural mages all but gone, the Bowestone is enchanted by following a strict set of instructions which usually focuses on a single emotion/concept which is associated with the Magicka\u2019s element.\u00a0Tranquility\u00a0ElementEmotion/ConceptCommon ReagentsFire\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Anger/PassionFire, Ash, Sparks, CharcoalWaterCalm/Tranquility Water, Fish, Ice, Aquatic PlantsEarthStrength/EnduranceDirt, Plants, Stone, SandAirFreedom/SpeedBird Parts, Feathers, EggsLifeHappiness/LivingPlants, Seeds, Baby Hair,\u00a0Umbilical  chordsDeathSaddness/DyingBones, Flesh, RemainsWillSelf BeliefNoneFortuneGreed/Personal GainGold, GemsTo activate or use Magicka requires a person to either firmly grip the stone or compel it to activate through selective wording almost like an activation phrase. Upon activation a dazzling display of light illuminates the immediate area followed by a magic seal which appears at the point of activation for a moment or two as the spell is released from the stone.\u00a0See here for example of magical sealAfter each use the Magicka begins to become unstable and slowly falls apart. On its last use the Magicka will disintegrate into shards which will float harmlessly into the air releasing it into the environment. It is rumoured that fortune Magicka does not give off a light or a seal allowing it\u2019s activation to be completely undetectable but incoming reports are unreliable. Members of the Mages Guild, due to their close proximity to the Magicka enchanting process and vigorous training, have certain techniques and equipment which can prolong the usage of Magicka to get more uses out of a single stone then others.
