Steeped in tradition this guild focuses on the improvement and showcasing of one\u2019s martial prowess, the importance of one\u2019s honour and the bond that men build in battle. To join the Fighters Guild you must first spar with a Champion to such a standard which impresses them enough to allow you into the guild as an initiate. The everyday tasks a member of the Fighters Guild might face may include, but is not limited to, practicing/teaching a weapon stance/form/technique, crafting fine weaponry, tests of strength and skill in the form of tournaments and sparring for sport or trophy hunting. The Fighters Guild are often commissioned by the public to take on jobs such as protecting farmland and caravans or clearing out dens of bandits and beasts; jobs seemingly too minute and mundane to govern the military\u2019s attention. The Fighters Guild has a strong distain for Magicka and the users of it and has a number of specialized pieces of equipment and techniques for dealing with such people and situations.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/56FyGDR.png", "http://drakonis.org/_datas/7/v/0/7v0ng7m0e3/i/uploads/7/v/0/7v0ng7m0e3/2010/09/19/20100919204310-8eb0b98b-cu_s9999x200.jpg", "http://drakonis.org/_datas/7/v/0/7v0ng7m0e3/i/uploads/7/v/0/7v0ng7m0e3/2010/09/19/20100919204300-31f9fb2d-cu_s9999x200.jpg", "http://drakonis.org/_datas/7/v/0/7v0ng7m0e3/i/uploads/7/v/0/7v0ng7m0e3/2010/09/19/20100919204236-dec3be80-cu_s9999x200.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><b>The Fighters Guild</b></div>"}}
