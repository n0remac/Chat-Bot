The secret order of thieves offers fences, fronts, bribes and various degrees of tools and equipment to those willing to see a slight margin of their bounty \u201cdonated\u201d to the guild. Most members of the guild act independently contacting their brothers only to sell goods or restock, some however find great companionship and form organised groups to pull off some of the better paid and more risky jobs. While most of the time thieves operate opportunistically sometimes jobs trickle down to \u201cacquire\u201d certain items or plant incriminating evidence on unsuspecting individuals, for a nominal fee of course.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/K5g8MY3.png", "http://drakonis.org/_datas/7/v/0/7v0ng7m0e3/i/uploads/7/v/0/7v0ng7m0e3//2014/08/22/20140822063611-4b87363a-cu_s9999x200.jpg", "http://drakonis.org/_datas/7/v/0/7v0ng7m0e3/i/uploads/7/v/0/7v0ng7m0e3/2010/09/19/20100919225624-2af1ec71-cu_s9999x200.jpg", "http://drakonis.org/_datas/7/v/0/7v0ng7m0e3/i/uploads/7/v/0/7v0ng7m0e3/2010/09/19/20100919230222-eacf1154-cu_s9999x200.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><b>The Thieves Guild<br><br/></br></b></div>"}}
