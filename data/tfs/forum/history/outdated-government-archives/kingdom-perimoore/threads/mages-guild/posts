With Magicka becoming easily accessible throughout the kingdom, the natural mages of old became few and far between replaced instead with commoners wielding the same level of power with not even a fraction of the training or restraint. The level of renegade mages and criminals rose dramatically forcing the Perimoore military and the fighter's guild to take up arms against the Magicka wielding masses. A period of chaos ensued with the mages guild trying to distance themselves from this new breed of mages. Many lives were lost and, once things were back under control, strict sanctions and rules were placed on the use of Bowestone and Magicka. The Mages guild, as the most qualified, was to oversee the production and distribution of Magicka throughout the kingdom.Over many years the Mages guild lost its old ways and began to adopt the widespread use of Magicka throughout their ranks. Now every piece of Magicka found in Perimoore is made by the hands of a member of the guild. Members of the Mages guild are tasked with researching magics, creating Magicka from raw Bowestone, searching for and capturing magical artifacts and bringing to justice rogue mages and those that would use Magicka unlawfully. Joining the mages guild is as easy as registering in their guild hall in Perimoore city.ApprenticeOnce registered as a member of the Mages guild you will be given the title of Apprentice. You are just starting on your quest to learn the mysterious ways of Magicka and as such you will be treated as if you had no prior knowledge. To advance you must following the Magicka creation process from start to finish in it's entirety under the supervision of a Magus or Artificer. During this time you will be taught how Magicka is created and, at the end of the process, you will be knowledgeable enough to create your own.MagusAs a fully fledged Magus of the Mages Guild you will be able to take quests to research magic, create Magicka, protect Bowestone mines and search for long lost magical artifacts. When you are promoted from Apprentice you will be given a Magus staff, as a symbol of your understanding of Magicka. This staff prolongs the durability of Magicka used allowing a mage to get double the usually uses from the same stone before it shatters.ArtificerTo reach the rank of Artificer within the Mages Guild you must complete a total of five mages guild quests and led an apprentice through the Magicka creation process. As an Artificer your knowledge of Magicka is unparalleled knowing all there is to know about the magical Bowestone which runs under the Kingdom of Perimoore. Because of this you have learnt how to create magicka more efficiently allowing you to purchase any fire, water, earth or air Magicka for half price. (The usual fame requirements still apply.)", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/fJnzLjx.png", "http://drakonis.org/_datas/7/v/0/7v0ng7m0e3/i/uploads/7/v/0/7v0ng7m0e3/2010/09/19/20100919233619-cb5fde01-cu_s9999x200.jpg", "http://drakonis.org/_datas/7/v/0/7v0ng7m0e3/i/uploads/7/v/0/7v0ng7m0e3/2010/09/19/20100919233658-67074ffa-cu_s9999x200.jpg", "http://drakonis.org/_datas/7/v/0/7v0ng7m0e3/i/uploads/7/v/0/7v0ng7m0e3/2010/09/19/20100919233533-6e47afb3-cu_s9999x200.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><b>The Mages Guild</b></div>"}}
