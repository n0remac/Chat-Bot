Paladins: The Aaedanian Paladin is master of battle and magic. They done heavy armor unique to their sect. They use two kinds of weapons. War Mauls or Battle Hammers with shields. The magic they use is highly specialized. Casting healing spells, defensive barriers and rarely a temporary resuection spell. The last is rarely used and if examined would be seen as neromancy. They have strong beleifs in the Aaedanian god Aeon, the god of the sun and life. Wolf Priests: Wolf Priests exist in small number. They are the opposite of Paladins, putting their beleif in the Aaedanian god Lito, the god of the moon and death. Essentially assassins these men and women are rangers\u00a0 trained and mages learned. They prefer bows and use their arrows as vessels for their spells. They use what ever magics they can to diliver the most carnage on the feild of battle and offer Lito the most souls. Arrows that fley faster and further than any other archer. Arrows that explode like a trebuche. Arrows that will slow enemy movements so others can decent upon them with fury. Spells that allow the move through the battle unseen, unheard and with swift intent. They will target officers and leaders on the field first and work their way down to the little men. They are nocturnal by habbit and fight best in the dark.
