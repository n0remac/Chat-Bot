The KingThe King of Aaedan is tasked with three major responsibilities.To lead the Aaedanian armies in times of war.  To be a representative and example of Aaedan's strength and wisdom to his and other peoples. To keep the Magistrate in check, this means approving or disapproving any actions the Magistrate does. The MagistrateThe Magistrate is a council of about 25 people known as Magisters. Magisters are elected by the people from military Legates and Praetors. The requirements are simple. The candidate must be thirty years old and have gone through additional schooling. The Magistrate has several responsibilities. Passing, changing or redacting laws. Levying taxes, this is not used much due to the Aaedanian Economics system. Resource ManagementManagement of Social programs. (I.e. schools)These are just the primary example, as a whole the Magisters keep Aaedan running. This is their job. Those are the major players. There are other 3 other titles to mention here. Archons, Praetors and the Consort. Archons:These are rulers of townsThey are in charge of the local garrison and are duty bound to use the garrison to protect the town. These are usually Tribune in military rank. Praetors: Preators while military in rank they have much political influence. They have no government duties other than to their soldiers, however, Preators often involve themselves and participate in government affairs, voicing the mind of the military as the Magisters are supposed to do for the people. The Consort:The Consort is the Kings personal advisers, they offer insight into Diplomacy, War, Intrigue, and Magic. They are awarded the rank of Praetor when inaugurated. The role of High Magus: As there was never a Magus King in Aaedan, this member of the consort offers knowledge of the magical realm, how to defend oneself from magics and has been known to enchant the kings weapons and armor. Additionally the High Magus oversees the few magical academies in the kingdom. The role of Ambassador: Newly created with the discovery of new kingdoms, this particular character is usually far better at being diplomatic than the King. They maintain knowledge of the important political figures within the land and without. They offer diplomatic solutions while others see only war.The role of Spymaster: Originally a term meant to scout and spy on enemies around the borders of Aaedan. Now this person maintains a network of spies within and without the kingdom. They offer unconventional tactics and ideas while agents under control of the spymaster can perform assassinations or sabotage.The role of High Praetor:  This member of the consort steps in and leads the armies of Aaedan when the King is otherwise unavailable. In combat other members of the consort must follow his orders as though he were the King. In the meantime however, he insures soldiers are trained properly, runs drills and makes sure the army is in fighting order.Current Members of GovernmentKing & Consort:King: King Jorech MannHigh Magus: Levi ThunderstruckSpymaster: NikolaiAmbassador: Princess Nyx Mann (Available) High Praetor: John Bartholomew (Available)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Magisters & ArchonsArchon of the White City: AvailableMagisters: Available (planned to be npc)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PraetorsPraetor of the 1st Leigon: Praetor-Rex GalaarPraetor of the 2nd Leigon: Preator-Rex Theo AlwhinPraetor of the 3rd Leigon: Archduke Ralof MannPraetor of the 4th Leigon: Praetor-Rex Raynold Takans (Available)Praetor of the 5th Leigon: Optio-Praetor-Rex Holthow Bartholomew (Available)", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": ":"}}
