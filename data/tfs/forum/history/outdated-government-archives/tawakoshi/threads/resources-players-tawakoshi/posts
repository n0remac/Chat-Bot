If you need anything, please contact either of the Tawakoshi accounts here, or seek out one of the owners on TFS Discord: Otter (Kazu#9868) or SouKo (Souko#0320). We have a Tawakoshi room there you can post questions in. We can talk plots, characters, and ideas with you, and advise you on anything regarding the lore and settings.\u00a0Foreigners in TawakoshiSPOILER: Click to showTamisho PortAlthough Tawakoshi is far away from many of the countries in the Overworld, the existence of this nation has been made known through the international trading of Quying. Tawakoshi welcomes foreign trade, diplomacy and even tourism. Depending on the location and manner in which foreigners enter the reception they receive may be different. Please be aware that borders usually require permission to pass, but special quests and locations may be open to all without needing to pass the borders. If you wish to bring your character to Tawakoshi, go right ahead! You can always contact one of the owners to discuss plots and possibilities. Playing a character from TawakoshiNo one is expecting you to read all of this, but here is some info that might be helpful making or playing a character from Tawakoshi.Tawakoshi is based on late Sengoku and early Edo period Japan (16th-17th century) with bits and pieces from other East Asian times and places. We mainly focused on Japanese elements because that is what we know best, but please feel free to add Chinese, Korean and other East Asian influences to the pot! HonorificsSPOILER: Click to showThe most common words in \u201cOld Tawakoshi\u201d that are used are forms of address and honorifics. Placed at the end of someone\u2019s name they can be used either with the surname or given name depending on the level of formality. -image--sama The highest honorific. Best for peasants and below to use this for anyone of samurai class and above.-dono Equivalent to \u201clord\u201d this is what samurai will use towards their superiors, or among lords of approximate equal rank. -san The polite way to address pretty much anyone. -chan A diminutive. Use this for your female love interest, close family members, children or anyone who you think won\u2019t mind. No honorific \u2013 only used for close friends, social inferiors, or if you are deliberately being insulting. [Please give people the benefit of the doubt in RP though!]There are loads more of these but if using something obscure, please also give a translation in your post. NamesSPOILER: Click to showTraditional name order is surname first then given name, e.g. Hizashi (surname) Kojuro (given name). Most characters have their profile set up as Given name, Surname, but tend to use Surname, Given name in RP. If you\u2019re confused please ask the player concerned to clarify. The site below is a great resource for names, but really you only need one surname and one given name, you can ignore the rest as it gets too fiddly. If you are making a character who is not samurai class, it is usual for them to have only a given name, e.g. Torakichi. www.sengokudaimyo.com/miscellany/names.htmlOtter (this Tawakoshi account) will also help you out with names if you need it, but don't bother asking SouKo he's a name thief.
