{"post-80520": {"user": "Tawakoshi", "user_num": 2480, "timestamp": "1521030143000", "message": "IntroductionTawakoshi is made up of two islands, a large one which constitutes the mainland, and Sarisu to the north-west. It is a very long sea voyage east from most of the Overworld, and until recently, Tawakoshi was an isolated nation. It has come to the notice of the outside world primarily through Quying\u2019s advanced trade and sea travel, and invitations from foreign nations to engage in diplomacy.Tawakoshi is an Empire, whose figurehead is a semi-divine Emperor, Emperor Katsuhiko. He performs a ceremonial role interceding between the heavenly and earthly realms. The country is governed centrally by an Imperial Court led by a Lord Regent, and locally by Daimyo - samurai warlords with both military and civil power. LocalitiesSPOILER: Click to showJeoncho (Capital - Sakura-Kyo) This domain is held by the Hizashi clan and has some of the best master craftspeople in Tawakoshi, specialising in luxury items, textiles, swordsmithing and armour. The capital is also the most culturally advanced city in Tawakoshi.Sarisu - The island of Sarisu is held by the Hizashi clan, and is now considered part of the domain of Jeoncho. This island once featured a centre of great learning and knowledge that is now buried deep under rockfalls. Kiyonai (Capital \u2013 Kiyonai) This domain is held by the Hizashi clan. Containing the island\u2019s most fertile farmland and forests, it also has some mountainous areas which protect the plains from the worst of the weather. Kiyonai is a pleasant and civilised province for the most part and the capital is quite beautiful. Tokhung (Capital \u2013 Mutsunobe) This domain is currently known to be held by the Yukimoto clan. Mountainous and cold, Tokhung is looked upon as being the poor relation of the provinces of Tawakoshi. Prisoners and disgraced nobles were often sent there by the Shogun. However, it is rich in the iron ore and other precious commodities hidden deep in the earth, for those who can bear its harshness. Quying (Capital - Quying) Quying is a semi-autonomous protectorate under the rule of the Zuikaku clan. Quying is the base for foreign trade within Tawakoshi and boasts the finest ships and navy. Unlike most of the nation, Quying\u2019s ruling class directly employs magic-users in an official capacity. Quying\u2019s social structure is also somewhat different. There is more information on Quying here: thefantasysandbox.boards.net/board/420/province-quyingSocial StructureSPOILER: Click to showSocial structure in Tawakoshi is highly stratified. While there is some social mobility between the levels of society, this is not at all usual. The social hierarchy is extremely important in all dealings within Tawakoshi. Those of inferior status are expected to defer to their social betters. It is considered the duty of those lower down to do the bidding of those higher up, and of those higher up to govern well for the benefit of maintaining the social order. The basic hierarchy is as follows:-image-Nobles - Emperor/Empress and the Royal Court. The current ruler is Emperor Katsuhiko.Samurai - The daimyo, their clans, their vassal clans, and anyone of land-owning class. Lower rank samurai may be farmers as well as warriors.Peasants - Farmers and fisherfolk. They produce food and are highly valued. This is by far the largest class in Tawakoshi society.Artisans - Craftspeople and artists. Merchants - Although they can be extravagantly wealthy, they produce nothing. Their low status stems from the idea of love of money being ignoble and base.Outside the hierarchy: Monks, priests/priestesses, and doctors - they associate freely with all classes.Foreigners - As exceptional people they are treated differently.Criminals - Nominally at the bottom of the social ladder, they have their own hierarchies and organisations.OrganisationsSPOILER: Click to showThe Imperial Court - Tawakoshi\u2019s overall ruling body, overseen by the Lord Regent. All Daimyos have a role at court. The Hizashi Clan - The largest of the Daimyo clans, the Hizashi also has the largest presence at court, and the largest army. The head of the Hizashi clan is also the Lord General of the Imperial Army.The Zuikaku Clan - The rulers of Quying. The head of the Zuikaku clan is also the Lord Admiral of the Imperial Navy.The Yukimoto Clan - The newest of the Daimyo clans, the Yukimoto took Tokhung by force and executed the former Damiyo. They have a large number of female warriors.San\u2019in Onmitsu - A family of spies, scouts and assassins that work for Hizashi clan, resident in the mountains of Kiyonai province in a small, unassuming village.Xiong\u2019s Spy Ring - An independent information brokery run from a brothel. They have no allegiance to anyone, and make it their business to collect secrets.The House of Reason - Tawakoshi\u2019s centre for anti-magic learning, independent from the power structure but not without influence of their own.Jeoncho Triads - A group of respectable-seeming gangsters operating out of a Xuandao silk merchant emporium.The Corner Dragon - An illegal gambling den that often has magic items and other illicit goods available to the right customers.

Most of the classic literature and books is written in this old language, and it is also used for formal communication and ceremonies. Most citizens can speak both, and the majority of citizens can also read and write. CurrencySPOILER: Click to showTawakoshi uses the standard Overworld currency system for most transactions. The coins are as follows: 1 Copper coin = 1 Mon. These are small copper coins that are round with a square hole in the middle. They are frequently strung together for easy carrying. 1 Silver coin = 1 Jumon. These silver coins are square in shape.1 Gold coin = 1 Ryo. These gold coins are oval in shape.1000 Ryo = 1 Koban. These heavy gold coins are oval in shape like a ryo, but much bigger. They are the currency found in samurai\u2019s mansions and wealthy merchants\u2019 coffers.ReligionSPOILER: Click to showTawakoshi has many spiritual beliefs, mainly focusing on a communion with and respect for nature. Everything in nature is considered to be a kami \u2013 a spirit or god. The sun is the most important one, being considered the highest goddess, but even a tree or a rock can be considered a kami. Shrines to these deities are dotted around all over the islands, some large, some small, and the nature of them is very dependent on what kind of kami is worshipped there. There are also temples that focus more on the inner spiritual development of humankind, where priests, priestesses, monks and nuns try to better themselves and the people at large through self-reflection, prayer and compassionate works. These temples are also used as neutral meeting places, resting places for travellers, and sometimes centres of martial arts practice. MagicSPOILER: Click to showMagic use was banned for many years under the Shogunate, but this will be coming under review in the new regime. Magic users were executed, fled overseas or into the harshest places on Tawakoshi, or they hid their talents from the Shogun\u2019s men.Nowadays, it is rare to find someone with innate magic.  So much so that many believe that magic is only a legend. While magic use is frowned upon by society, it still happens, and most local rulers allow it, even though it is officially still banned. Bearing this in mind, practitioners of magic entering Tawakoshi should beware not to disturb the peace. Magical creatures exist within Tawakoshi. These are either thought of as yokai (monsters) or kami (spirits) and are avoided or worshipped accordingly. Most yokai tend to stay away from human society, or enter it in disguise. Many yokai are animals with magical powers, and many of them have such abilities as shapeshifting or illusions. The House of ReasonSPOILER: Click to show , Anti-magic use is governed by the House of Reason, where monks pray and study the natural anti-magic presence there. The Monks of Reason are seen as free thinkers as well as scholars and protectors of both anti-magic and Tawakoshi as a whole. The House of Reason pre-dates the Shogunate and is stays detached from politics. Tawakoshi makes use of a system of anti-magic barriers to protect the island as a whole, and the important cities.  These nullify magic use cast from outside. There are anti-magic checkpoints in strategic places where magic is negated. Magic can still be used within these barriers. The anti-magic network is maintained by the House of Reason and requires regular upkeep by the monks.", "link_list": ["javascript:void(0);", "javascript:void(0);", "javascript:void(0);", "https://flic.kr/p/2458VZS", "https://flic.kr/p/2458VZS", "https://www.flickr.com/photos/137813549@N06/", "javascript:void(0);", "javascript:void(0);", "https://flic.kr/p/23bX4fQ", "https://flic.kr/p/23bX4fQ", "https://www.flickr.com/photos/137813549@N06/"], "image_list": ["https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4671/40615364951_deb33ca835.jpg", "https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4773/40084576264_6cbb9be4e7_b.jpg", "https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4644/39505313152_9a1cf31c16_b.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><b>Language</b></div>"}, "post-80522": {"user": "Tawakoshi", "user_num": 2480, "timestamp": "1521031380000", "message": "MilitarySPOILER: Click to showTawakoshi\u2019s landed class is a military one. Individual Daimyos have their own armies, but they are beholden to a direct command from the Imperial Court or Emperor in the service to their nation, in which case the Lord General of the Imperial Army will lead the united Tawakoshi army.  A daimyo may have several generals, usually these are his or her banner lords. An army might typically be composed of elite mounted samurai units that fight with a spear or less commonly a bow as primary weapon, tachi or katana as a side-arm, and units of common foot soldiers called ashigaru led by samurai commanders, who would be armed with spears or bows. Monks join battle occasionally, and usually fight using a naginata. There are many uncommon and interesting weapons too. Magic is not generally used in combat. Women of the samurai class are often also trained in combat, depending on the traditions of her family or clan, but it is unusual that they go to fight in battle. Usually they are expected to defend the castle or home of their clan. History of TawakoshiSPOILER: Click to showAt one time Tawakoshi and Katashima were ruled by the same Emperor. The two nations split from each other when Katashima favoured one successor, and Tawakoshi another. Since that time the two islands have been closely related culturally but are two separate nations. While Katashima since fell into civil war, Tawakoshi was united by the Ogino Shogunate, 75 years ago, and has remained thus until recently.The first Shogun, Ogino Tadatsugu, took control of Tawakoshi by a combination of force of arms and diplomacy, persuading the Emperor to bestow upon him the office of Shogun based on the premise that his strong government would stop any invasion by Katashima. Tadatsugu ruled with an iron fist, and was vehemently against magic use, seeing it as the one force within Tawakoshi that he could not control. The Shogunate hunted down and killed magic users, outlawing magic as an \u201cunnatural practice\u201d. The second Shogun, his son Ogino Tadayasu, ruled peacefully for many years, and had a good relationship with the Emperor for the most part, involving him in decision making. While Tadayasu led the nation with a firm hand, there was stability in the land and not much need to crack down on enemies as his father had destroyed them all. The third Shogun, Tadayasu\u2019s son Shingen, ruled for many years. Although he had the good standing of his ancestors behind him, he grew a reputation for being unpredictable, despotic, and perhaps a little unhinged. Very recently, Shingen was overthrown by the forces of the Hizashi and Zuikaku clans, who wished to bring back stability to the nation and return power to the Emperor. Shingen was killed under mysterious circumstances in his own palace, and the Shogunate was abolished. Emperor Katsuhiko appointed a new Lord Regent and Imperial Court for the overall running of the country, while regional Daimyos continue to rule the provinces. Today the Hizashi clan is the greatest power in the Empire aside from the Emperor himself. The head of the Hizashi clan Lord Kojuro maintains his clan's traditional stronghold of Kiyonai, while Homura Hizashi has been appointed Lord Regent by the Emperor.
