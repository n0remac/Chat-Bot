While their walls, although made only of black stone are so much infused with magic that nothing has yet been able to damage them at all. The use of necromancy is also a touchy subject. Almost everyone agrees that their knowledge in the field is beyond comprehension and is powerful beyond imagining, yet it is strictly controlled and even looked down upon by the the noblemen and women.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Belrow's culture is surrounded in mystery.
