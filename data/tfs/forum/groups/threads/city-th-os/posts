Hundreds of years old, the city was founded by vagabonds and criminals, and many of the citizen\u2019s pasts remain unknown. The city claims to be a fresh opportunity for all, with almost no unemployment and a government that is no stranger to turning a blind eye. The city itself is located in a cavern over 500 feet beneath the surface. The main known entrance to Th\u00edos is via Neamh Falls, an impressive waterfall which cascades deep beneath the ground. All known ways into the city are heavily guarded, with people requiring permits or citizenship to enter. However, there are undiscovered tunnels, and tunnels in use that the average resident or visitor would simply never know about. The city fills the cavern, a strong stone castle that is built into the earth takes centre stage, with The Hookies growing from the foundations and spreading out across the flat plane of the cavern. \u2018The Hookies\u2019 are the suburbs of Th\u00edos. A ramshackle of constructions, some 6 stories high, where the working class and less wholesome citizens of the city reside. Beneath this area, underground streams and ponds slither through the city, before falling off the plane into apparent oblivion. Various tunnel systems lead from the cavern, heading to farm-land, mines such as The Old Olc Pit and further afield, Litri\u00fa, and other, undiscovered or avoided areas.The city is government by a supposedly democratic group. Originally, the city was built by humble men looking for an escape from the average power-hungry leader. However, as time went by a nobility did form, and the \u2018Unlord\u2019 of the city has remained in the same family for decades. The Arthgallo\u2019s are stoic family, known for their straight-forwardness and apparent simple-minds. The people relate to them. But all is not as it seems.OTHER RELATIONS AND NOTES:The main income of Th\u00edos is mining, of both raw materials such as coal and other rock substances, to gemstones and magic sources. The majority of the city work in the mines, where conditions are brutal. They also trade vegetables grown in their man-made farm land.Th\u00edos is a welcoming place to most races. The majority are human, and magical ability is not so common, therefore Th\u00edans can be quite suspicious of magic-wielders. They are an incredibly loyal people, and treachery is the most convicted of all crimes, with the punishment being death. Some Th\u00edans have never emerged from beneath the ground. They are known as a strange people, with a sense of humour some don\u2019t understand and a burning loyalty that is often overwhelming. Spending a whole lifetime below has its effects, many Th\u00edans cannot look at direct sunlight, and blindfolds have become a sort of fashion statement. Their other senses are heightened, and fighting whilst completely blind is a native sport.Close range weapons are popular in Th\u00edos, especially knives.CURRENTLY:Strange happenings are spreading throughout Th\u00edos. Sightings of odd creatures, kidnappings and robberies; more than usual with odd evidence, or lack of. The opening and abrupt closing of Litri\u00fa* has left people wary, and everything is being questioned. But these questions are being destroyed with force before they leave a person\u2019s lips. The government is crushing dissent as opposing groups begin to form. Tensions are rising.THREADS:The City of\u00a0Th\u00edosThe HookiesNeamh FallsThe Old Orc PitLitri\u00faCHARACTER INDEX:Tier ArthgalloAlvaDiabhalOPPORTUNITIES FOR:Investigators, Relation Officers, MetalworkersOOC Notes:All players must pass through Neamh Falls to enter the city, unless good reason otherwise.

A new-found treasure trove that would bring riches to the city. A new community was built here, where they had discovered a cavern brimming with gemstones. The town was built from stone, glowing in grandeur. However, as excavation began, it became evident that all was not as it seems. Everything here seemed a little too perfect. Almost as though someone else had already made it their home. Litri\u00fa undoubtedly had a magical essence. One that was not respected. No one is entirely sure what happened. But Litri\u00fa now lies in ruin. Some still venture there as the riches remain. Not all return. The cavern itself seems untouched. But the towering stone pillars and spiralling towers of the town lay crumbled along the magnificent walkways, littered with debris\u2026 and skeletons.
