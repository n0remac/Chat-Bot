The Knights of the Order make up the bulk of their offensive, but\u00a0 Paladins grace their Order. Paladins of Vendurelen take the Will of their God, the Holy One, to cast Light and heal the wounds of their comrades. The Light can also be used offensively, blinding and searing.\u00a0The ranks of the Vendure Order are simple. Initiates carry out most of the servant duties of the order, like cleaning and washing. Squires serve under Knights in the Order, and follow their Knights into combat. A Knight is the next rank, the largest population within the order. The next would be Knight-Commander, a few Knights obtain this rank, and lead the other into battle. The last rank is that of Grandmaster, only held by one person.The more Holy side of the Order is populated by Priests and Paladins.\u00a0Charge of the 600\"Noble Six Hundred.
