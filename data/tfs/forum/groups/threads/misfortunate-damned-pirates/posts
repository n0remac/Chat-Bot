After being expelled from the  bowels of Davy Jone's locker he was set adrift upon a small dingy, which seemed as if resurrected from the watery  grave, the  hull  was an eerie green which seemed to glow just beneath the surface of the water, and the  boat itself  skimmed across the surface of water like a knife through   cloth.. it drifted  aimlessly carrying its unconscious passenger like  a gondola across the River  Styx.The boat  was discovered by the Misfortunate  bobbing upon the open sea -- and the -boy-  was quickly brought abroad.  Form slightly  withered  and mouth h parched from the days  at sea.  He was placed in a holding cell while they decided the boy's fate. Many wanted to toss him  back out to sea  from wence he came but eventually he was allowed to join to crew as a mere cabin hand. He did not speak much nor complain despite  the long and arduous days, despite  the  treatment from the more seasoned crew. Still  to this day not  many know  of his origins save for perhaps  the captain himself if he cared to remember.  The boy moved  with a practiced step and used  his knowledge of the  seas as well  as his cunning nature to distinguish himself among the other crew members and was eventually named  Navigator... Gulo , unlike most other pirates did not covet  gold, rum[though he's known to drink occasionally] , nor woman as most pirates  seemed to .. no.. the promise of revenge was payment enough.
