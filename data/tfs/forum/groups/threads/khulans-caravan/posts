They claim themselves as merchants looking to carve a living in the mainland, lead by a stoic leader by who it is named after,\u00a0Khulan. Though this land is alien to them, they do not discriminate between those who wish to join and welcome many with open arms. Human, giant, fae? Anyone is welcome, so long as they accept Khulan as the caravan leader. They are a small group, only twenty strong, but they seek to strengthen their numbers as they travel.They travel under Khulan's flag, symbolizing their freedom from the\u00a0tyrannical rule of their home and their proficiency\u00a0for mounted archery.At the moment, after receiving an Assent certification that allows them to trade with the City of Isra, they ride a dangerous path through a Wilderness Road, hoping to pass through the Elven City of Mithlonde, resupply, and continue to their destination: The Rharak Mine. A small group from the caravan has split off to establish early connections with Mithlonde before the main group arrived at the gates of Isra.The Caravan is currently seeking merchants, traders, miners, and most importantly protection, as their numbers are small, but their wares valuable.List of Current Hired HandsRudiger DornmauerConchobarDeidra NofaloJulianique EoflekCaptain Frederick GarsThe journey thus far:\u00a0The Northern Pass to IsraYou Win Some, You Lose SomeA Rough StartIn Folly They Trust", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/user/2705", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/user/2689", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/user/2761", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/user/3126", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/user/3150", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/user/3263", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/post/76312/thread", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/post/76362/thread", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/post/77427/thread", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/3268/town-folly"], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/0H4OtUr.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/ofk1Su2.png"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><b style=\"font-size:xx-large;\"><u>Khulan's Caravan\u00a0<br><br/></br></u></b></div>"}, "post-80895": {"user": "Khulan's Caravan", "user_num": 2929, "timestamp": "1522027240000", "message": "NPCs of the Toragana Caravan MunglingAge: 23Height: 5'7\"Weight: 150 lbsAn eccentric, wandering bard who travels with the Caravan to spread knowledge of the Toragana Mountains and its people. Occasionally, if one listens enough to his music, he will sing the histories about the members of the caravan- sometimes much to their chagrin! His preferred instrument is the horsehead fiddle, which was conceived in the Toragana Mountains. He is not a fighter, though he seems to have an interest in music-related magics.He is a reasonably feminine man, partially due to his elvish heritage. Still, the blood of the Toragana people runs strong within him, and there is no mistaking it comparing him to his comrades.SarangerelAge: 14Height: 5'0\"Weight: 115 lbsThe niece of Khulan, who is easily underestimated due to the large differences between both women. She is cheerful, talkative, and has no combat experience. Despite all this, she is fiercely intelligent. The speed at which she soaks in information is baffling, as is her thirst for learning politics. She believes that conflict is better resolved through a battle of words, if only because she laments when she sees her friends fall during battles of steel.Sarangerel is a short, thin girl with bold features and sea-green eyes. She has straw-colored\u00a0hair that falls just below her chin, usually covered up by a hat. UlagAge: 62Height: 9'2\"Weight: 730 lbsThough the pseudo-giant doesn't seem welcoming at first, what with his stony expression and a body built like a walking boulder. What most don't know is that Ulag has a laugh that rolls like thunder, and where he goes, there's always a storm. Though he is often seen harassing his brother, Kepek, the man has a warm countenance about him and is often gentle with those who do not share his strength.Like most men of the mountain, Ulag has dark hair and skin that easily bronzes beneath the light of the sun. He has grown his hair long and allows Sarangerel to braid it into a topknot so that it doesn't cause any trouble for him.He hefts a pickaxe, currently his only weapon. KepekAge: 68Height: 9'8\"Weight: 750 lbsWhere Ulag is the thunder, Kepek is the cloud. He is often teased for his dark, merciless humor, though his brother finds himself laughing despite it. Though he is quieter than his rumbling counterpart, he is no less cheerful and enjoys moments of singing, jesting, and the occasional tussle with the other giant that accompanies the caravan.Kepek never retained much of his dark hair in his age. Either that or it all migrated down to his face, where it is neatly kept in a long beard. His brows are thick and heavy, spidering over his eyes. There are moments he asks the sisters to cut them so that his vision is unburdened.He carries a pickaxe for now. ChambuiAge: 27Height: 5'10\"\u00a0Weight: 160 lbsOne of three sisters, Chambui\u00a0is a fearless warrior, always at the vanguard, always the first to charge in. She is very bluntly spoken but much chattier than Khulan. She's truthful to a fault, takes responsibility for her actions, and prizes loyalty and strength above all things. Her skill with the sword is hard-rivaled, though her strength is not in reading tactic.Though Chambui is a thickly muscled woman, she is not unfeminine. Her features are soft and she wears her hair long if hidden beneath a helmet more often than not.She is often armed with a bow and a one-handed saber. KhojinAge: 23Height: 5'7\"Weight: 140 lbsThe second of the sisters, Khojin enjoys strategy and prefers ambushing and silent assassinations. The sooner she can get the job done, the fewer casualties she'll have on her side. Though she doesn't enjoy lying, she's not one to reveal a lot of information about herself, and will dance around questions in a practiced manner if asked something that she would rather avoid.Slim, but mature, Khojin is built like a lean athlete who has no trouble running long distances, climbing to get vantage points, or pulling a bow.Khojin prefers the bow, though she also carries a large knife. She owns a falcon named Shiv. SamgaAge: 17Height: 5'2\"Weight: 115 lbsShe is the third of the sisters, but no less significant. Though she may be stubborn, rude, and dishonest, Samga proves herself to be one of the greatest assets in battle. Born with a knack for magic, Samga favors illusionary and enhancement magic, effectively allowing her to cripple her enemies and strengthen her allies.The only one smaller than Samga among the Toragana women is Sarangerel, though the sorceress seems much frailer. She can pull back a bow but uses magic to cheat her aim and her own physical strength.Samga can use a bow, however, she prefers to sit back and use her magic when she's able.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/Y7w7Arr.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/HfG2Ag5.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/nRbICXU.png", "https://i.imgur.com/GzgjjkH.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/0D9hgjs.png", "https://i.imgur.com/fobRP9S.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/186NRRR.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"font-size:xx-large;\"><b>NPCs of the Toragana Caravan</b></span></div>"}}
