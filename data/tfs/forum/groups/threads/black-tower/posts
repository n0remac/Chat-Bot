Approximately three hundred by three hundred feet, it towers 2500 feet into the sky, making it an imposing structure that can been seen from miles away. Around the base of the tower lies a rather sizable compound. A square wall surrounds this compound that is about two thousand feet in length and width. Around this wall lies a moat, filled with water, the only bridge over this moat being at the main gate.Inside this wall and surrounding the tower lie numerous three story buildings, mostly inhabited by the towers guards, dwarven builders, and a significant amount of mages whose magic power certain functions of the compound. There are also a few warehouses that distribute food for those living in the compound.The outer wall surrounding the compound and tower is twenty feet tall and has guards posted all along it. It also features guard towers that are seventy five feet tall at regular intervals along it. These towers sit on the inside of the wall and have one entrance at the ground level and one at the entrance to the tower walkway. There are also a number of ballista, catapults, and rather strange looking contraptions with glowing orbs in them placed along the wall. The tower itself is made of a dense black stone that almost seems to absorb the light around it, giving it an odd impression of darkening the area without actually doing so. A number of strange lines run through the stone on the outside of the tower, creating a multitude of complex runes, all woven into a series of recessed alcoves which harbor odd black crystals that fail to reflect any light. It should be noted if one were to fly over the tower, they would notice some strange structures on top. At the base of the tower are two large doors made from steel. The doors also feature strengthening runes on them and are balanced so well that a single man can open them when unlocked.This whole compound lies about two miles from the The Free City\u2019s walls, tower easily within sight range. Although originally built by Grandma, after her mysterious departure, the Black Tower was passed into the capable hands of Lord Tristian Seryl, formerly of Medan. Much like his predecessor, he keeps the nature of the Black Tower and its activities a secret from the general public.While the Black Tower's nature and operations are unknown to the world at large, its main mission is that of peacekeeping. They are a neutral collection of powerful beings, talented individuals, and diplomats held in standby to protect, enforce, and encourage peace. This includes the gathering of information and, when necessary, the deployment of operatives and contracted non-operatives to defuse tense situations, combat forces, and negotiate, depending upon the situation and what sort of touch is required.LocationsThe Black Tower - Isra (Main/original location)The Black Tower - GauldinThe Black Tower - Land-Tiller's BranchMembers of The Black TowerLeadershipLord Tristian SerylNon-OperativesRaik\u014d (Business partner)Xel'rath (Contracted)Erlk\u00f6nig (Contracted)Jun of the Celadine (Contracted)Vikar Trannyth (Intelligence Agent)OperativesAveryn DaylenNiklas RorerRalf Valgard, the White WolfSilva The SkepticVigilFenrir SkargardCurrently SeekingIntelligence AgentsDiplomatsTacticians(OOC Note: To become a member of The Black Tower, please speak to Lord Tristian Seryl both by PM and IC, either at The Black Tower's Isra location or somewhere within the city of Isra.)", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1008/black-tower", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1174/black-tower-gauldin-branch", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1627/black-tower-land-tillers-branch", "/user/1222", "/user/911", "/user/797", "/user/806", "/user/108", "/user/924", "/user/980", "/user/938", "/user/451", "/user/876", "/user/544", "/user/1568", "/user/1222"], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/l4Ik67R.png", "http://i.imgur.com/9t684q9.jpg"], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/l4Ik67R.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/><br>(The official symbol of The Black Tower)<br/><br/><br/><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/9t684q9.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/></br></div>"}}
