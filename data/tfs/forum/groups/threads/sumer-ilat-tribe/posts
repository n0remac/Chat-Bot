Not composed solely of a single race, the Sumer-Ilat instead find their unity through a shared system of mythology and belief and include beings ranging from humans to mysterious lizardmen.\u00a0An example of a Sumer-Ilat tent village.Religion and MythologyThe Sumer-Ilat are unified through their shared mythology and belief in a pantheon of gods, often taking the form of deified creatures of the desert. At the heart of this mythology lies the dichotomy of night and day, represented by Shamash the Sun Goddess and the Moon God, Sin. Shamash is considered the supreme ruler of the world, who bathes it in the light of her beauty and power, allowing life to flourish. Sin is considered to be the one-eyed farlander and the everwatcher, whose great eye keeps watch over the world when Shamash sleeps.\u00a0Yet neither can be said to be truly benevolent, for while Shamash gives light her heat and power destroy the unvigilant, whose ancient remains are said to form the sand. It is similarly said that while Sin keeps watch in the darkness he also brings with it the chilling cold and desire to commit crimes and transgressions against ones own people, from which he gets his name.As the two greatest gods Shamash and Sin command the loyalty and respect of all other lesser deities, who fall under the purview of one or the other as the manifestations of some particular aspect that they command. These deities are often depicted as particular animals or beasts and all nearly all Sumer-Ilat dedicate their lives to one of these as an acolyte of that deity's sect, depending primarily on the time, day and month in which they were born. Personal characteristics and choice can also affect this decision, but to deviate from standard culture is seen as highly irregular. The importance of this system is such that belonging to particular sects dictate what professions one can work and what social status they can reach.Gods and SectsManifestations of ShamashKanu - The crocodile or lizard goddess is considered the manifestation of surprise, overwhelming power, ambushes and water. Acolytes of Kanu are usually born in spring and are often warriors or hunters.Enki - The laughing hyena god is considered the manifestation of humour and trickery. Acolytes of Enki are usually born in the early spring and are often entertainers, tricksters or hunters.Ilat - The cat goddess is considered the manifestation of elegance, vanity, agility, curiosity and wealth, but also of wisdom, \u00a0and prophecy. Acolytes of Ilat are usually born in the summer and are often oracles, thieves, hunters, nobles or treasure-seekers. Ilat is one of the most well-loved and worshipped deities and her acolytes more often reach higher places in Sumer-Ilat society.\u00a0Essur - The eagle god is considered the manifestation of nobility, courage and freedom. Acolytes of Essur usually born in the summer and are often leaders, nobles, warriors and beast-masters.\u00a0Alattin - The scarab god is considered the manifestation of dirt, perseverance and hard work. Acolytes of Alattin are usually born in either the spring or summer and tend to be artists, artisans, builders and labourers. (Thanks to Sushi for this one!)Others.Manifestations of SinAssyr\u00a0- The scorpion god is considered the manifestation of hunting, roaming, power, poison and alchemy. Acolytes of Assyr are usually born in the winter and are often warriors, assassins or alchemists.\u00a0Liliki\u00a0- The spider goddess is considered the manifestation of stealth, plans, traps, fate, dreams and seduction. Acolytes of Liliki are usually born in the winter and are often trappers, weavers, seducers or priests. Liliki is considered one of the most important Manifestations of Sin and is believed to weave complex fates and dreams in her webs, then entice people into them so that she can feed.\u00a0Sakanu - The snake god is considered the manifestation of rituals, secrecy and ambition, displaying the side of Sin that is cunning and untrustworthy. Acolytes of Sakanu are usually born in autumn and are often priests, hunters, assassins or merchants. Muro - The desert rat goddess is considered the manifestation of the swarm, fertility, disease and negligence. Acolytes of Muro are usually born in autumn and are often warriors, alchemists, scavengers, thieves or beggars.\u00a0Others.Surviving the Desert and Nomadic LifestyleMaking their home in the Sorala desert, most of the Sumer-Ilat tribes live a nomadic lifestyle. Capable of rapid and sustained movement across the sands, the Sumer-Ilat have mastered several key skills that allow them to survive in this near inhospitable environment. The first of these is animal-husbandry, a relationship between themselves and several species of desert dwelling creatures that approaches mutual symbiosis. Different tribes may focus more on some animals than others, but the frequency of trade and contact between them mean that most species of animal are familiar. These animals include camels, the hardy desert rhino, the speedy jackguar and the ferocious sand dragon.\u00a0Though rather scary looking, the sand dragons are only just large enough to ride and are kept mostly for the large number of eggs they produce. They are adept at hunting small creatures hidden in the sand, especially at night.\u00a0The Jackguar make fantastic hunting companions and the larger males can even be ridden. They have fantastic hearing and senses of smell, allowing them to track prey over large distances and find sources of water from miles away.The desert rhino can go weeks without food and water, while being strong enough to carry large amounts of supplies with ease. They can use their horns to break open tough ground to find sources of water deep in the desert.With these animals in tow, the Sumer-Ilat can not only sustain themselves for long periods of time but also travel quickly and efficiently across the desert. This is a crucial part of their second and third key skills, that of shelter and navigation respectively. The second skill refers to the Sumer-Ilat tent, a temporary shelter designed for sleeping and protection against sandstorms. Due to the practicality of this tent, it can be set up in as little as ten minutes and carefully taken down in less than five; this allows the tribes to set up entire villages of tents before an oncoming storm can reach them and, if need be, pack up and leave almost instantly. The tents are not only surprisingly resistant to the elements, but can be quickly reinforced with wood for a more permanent shelter.The third key skill is the use of navigation. Mastered with the use of the sun and stars, the Sumer-Ilat are second-to-none at using visual landmarks in their navigation techniques and pass down spoken maps of desert features to help them move. These features can range from anything from a single dead tree, to ancient ruins and statues that dot the sands and can also be used as temporary camp sites. They also use these skills to find water, food and resources that most would never think to see.\u00a0The fourth key skill is that of hunting. As the Sorala Desert is home to many dangerous beasts both large and small, the Sumer-Ilat have honed their ability at hunting not only out of necessity, but self-defence. Many are fast and agile fighters, capable of feats of stealth and ferocity in equal measure and specialising in the unconventional arts of fighting. Not only needing to fight their prey, the Sumer-Ilat's repeated confrontations with rival tribes and outsiders mean that their martial techniques also cover the art of warfare, though these highly potent skills are rarely taught to strangers. Such is the skill of Sumer-Ilat hunters that many of them embark on successful careers as assassins and rogues if they ever find themselves separated from their tribes or in foreign lands.\u00a0The fifth key skill is the art of prophecy. As a highly religious people, the Sumer-Ilat take great pride in their oracles, mystics and priests and their ability to receive messages from the gods. Though these methods are highly secret, many of the Sumer-Ilat believe that catastrophe is often avoided by listening to those among them who can see the future. They use this skill at magic to avoid danger whenever possible, or bring ruin to their foes.\u00a0Culture, Settlements and LeadershipPermanent settlements and centres are often built in ruins such as these, taking advantage of the architecture of long forgotten cities and ancient civilisations.Despite being a largely nomadic people, not all of the Sumer-Ilat adhere to a life walking the sands. Recognising the need and advantage of more permanent homes, several of the tribes chose to make their homes within the ruins and fortification of ancient cities, temples and natural formations like rocky canyons. Often with natural resources nearby, the men and women who live in these few and far-between settlements tend to live a more clean and comfortable life than their nomadic counterparts.\u00a0Due to their defensiveness and unmoving location, these settlements often become important hubs of religious, cultural and economic activity for the Sumer-Ilat. Many of the nomadic tribes spend their time travelling between them, trading goods and seeking religious guidance in the temples of their chosen deities. However, the slow and natural degradation of nearby resources over the centuries have meant that only a certain number of people can be comfortably sustained in them at one time, a fact that can become a source of friction between tribes.\u00a0In most cases migration to and from these settlements is highly regulated, with the controlling tribe usually reserving permanent living space for their own members or those with sufficient wealth and power or skill in a desired profession. Priests and oracles are almost guaranteed a home if they so choose, though most decide to stay with their own families as nomads. Similarly, skilled warriors, assassins, animal keepers, merchants and artisans are also more likely to be allowed to stay. Most settlements also dedicate themselves to the worship of one or two particular deities and are biased towards acolytes of their own sects.Daily life for the Sumer-Ilat generally consists of work and prayer to their gods, though the time at which they do this differs depending on which manifestation the acolyte belongs to. Acolytes of Shamash tend to pray during the midday hours, when the sun is highest in the sky and people stop work to seek shelter and rest. Acolytes of Sin tend to pray in the evening before sleep, under the watchful eye of the moon. Religious custom varies depending on the deity worshipped, but can include gifts of treasure or animal sacrifice. Many people often attend public sermons on a daily or weekly basis and are also encouraged to speak to oracles for predictions and precognition at least once a month.Leadership of the Sumer-Ilat tends to come from individual tribal chieftains or religious leaders, but there is very little in the way of a single shared leadership for all the Sumer-Ilat tribes. The most likely candidates for overall cultural guidance come from the high priests and priestesses of the gods, but they don't have the power to control tribes directly like the chieftains do and their political influence is largely confined to their religious sects. In times where combined leadership is required, the high priests and priestesses may join the tribal chieftains in a great gathering known as the Sarrutum - a council of Sumer-Ilat that together votes on and decides the overall actions of their people. If the need is great enough, or in times of war, the tribal chieftains may elect an individual to be the Sarrum - king, or pharoah of all Sumer-Ilat. This individual is then crowned by the high priests of the manifestations and said to have the divine power and authority of the gods until he or she dies, though currently there is no such figure.\u00a0People and RacesThe Sumer-Ilat tribes consist of multiple intelligent races, several of whom evolved in the desert and several who migrated to it generations ago. These races can vary from humanoid to beast-like and include races so rare and few that even most Sumer-Ilat have never seen them. The most common races are Humans, Sand Elves and Lizardmen (who themselves come in a variety of different shapes and sizes), with less-viewed races including the Snake People and feline-like Miran. There are even rumours of spider-like creatures who only emerge under certain conditions...A large, male Sumer-Ilat Lizardman.Most nomadic tribes consist of only one race, though larger ones may include families from others. The most diverse places are the settlements, where most of the races can be found in number. There's surprisingly little racial tension among the Sumer-Ilat, with their culture accepting differences between the races as a matter of life that in no way lessens their deserving of respect. Because these differences are acknowledged (and perhaps celebrated), the Sumer-Ilat can't be said to completely lack racial biases, though their status as a mono-culture society mean that they can live and work together without the distrust that a multi-cultural society often suffers from.A human priestess of Sakanu, whose rich and unique attire displays power, wealth and influence to the Sumer-Ilat.(Mostly finished.
