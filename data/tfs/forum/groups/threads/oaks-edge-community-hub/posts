{"post-89910": {"user": "Oaks Edge", "user_num": 3395, "timestamp": "1556987626000", "message": "Hello and Welcome to Oaks Edge!Oaks Edge is a community project based on some of the ideas a few of our members have bandied about on the discord server. The purpose of Oaks Edge is to create a comfortable and easy \u2018jumping off point\u2019 for incoming new members to begin RPing immediately, and not have to initially put so much effort into sifting through the years of built-up lore and character development that are landmarks of some other settings in TFS. In Oaks Edge we hope to bring together brand-new players, grizzled veterans, and everyone in between for some fun in the classic European fantasy RP style!No actual RP should take place in this thread, but rather it is meant as a nearly all-inclusive guide for new players to quickly tell you almost everything you need to know to get started in Oaks Edge. If TFS seems like it is too much to take in right now \u2013 Don\u2019t worry! You can create a character and begin playing with us while you figure out where your next stop might be.Oaks Edge Description!Oaks Edge is, predictably, named for its geographical location on the edge of a century\u2019s old oak grove. The land around the town itself is made up of rich, fertile black soil perfect for farming, and the town center proper is - at the best of times - a small bustling nexus of activity. Adventurers are typically always made welcome, as the town has many businesses that benefit from the coin of passers-through.Things You Should Consider!\u2022\tThis guide supposes that you have read and are at least somewhat familiar with the Creating New Characters and Accounts, and the\u00a0Threads & Settings\u00a0stickies.\u2022\tYou can create as many characters as you want on TFS! With this in mind, please understand that we intend Oaks Edge to be a fun RP with low barriers of entry for everyone. The quests you find here and the people you meet will be far more interesting for all involved if your character isn\u2019t a high-speed whirling death machine. Just for Oaks Edge - we ask that any super powerful demigod characters you have planned wait for another town and another time. Please try your best to keep your character\u2019s power level set at \u201cstandard fantasy adventurer\u201d (again, this is only for Oaks Edge, and not for TFS as a whole).\u2022\tOaks Edge works a little differently than any of the bigger countries. Below, you will find a list of links to all active Oaks Edge threads. All you have to do is post into the \u201cRoad to Oaks Edge\u201d thread, and your journey will begin! From there, you are free to wait to be addressed by someone on the road, or if you prefer, keep moving on into one of the other threads that suits your fancy. Just try to make it clear in your post if you\u2019re moving on into Oaks Edge or waiting for someone else to come along.\u2022\tBecause Oaks Edge is a community project, all threads are the property and responsibility of the players who created the individual threads. This means that there is no centralized over-arching DM power that connects all of the threads like there would be in a country or city-state. While the aesthetic should be pretty cohesive throughout the threads, please understand that different threads are being run by different people, and one may move faster than another, or have a slightly different flavor than another, etc.\u2022\tYou can tag/message either Badger or Viking on the TFS discord to ask any questions you may have!Creating your own Oaks Edge setting!You don\u2019t have to create your own setting to play in Oaks Edge. You can simply make your character, and walk right in! But if you\u2019d like to create your own part of Oaks Edge, here\u2019s a few things to keep in mind.\u2022\tOne of the larger issues discussed previously was the lack of activity in places where new people might want to congregate. For this reason, we ask anyone who would like to create an Oaks Edge thread to take seriously the activity in that thread, and try to respond to posters in a timely manner. If life gets in the way, please let either Viking or Badger know so that your thread can be removed from the list for a short time until it becomes active again.\u2022\tBecause Oaks Edge is meant to be one town/region, all Oaks Edge settings will need to be submitted to either Viking or Badger on the TFS Discord for what is essentially an aesthetic check. This checking process will be extremely cursory, and will only keep out the most blatant of non-conformity.\u2022\tYou will actually make the Oaks Edge thread, and it is your responsibility.Active Oaks Edge Threads!Road to Oaks Edge [POST HERE FIRST]Oaks Edge Inn", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/3200/1-creating-new-characters-accounts", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/3201/2-threads-settings", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/3462/road-oaks-edge-post-first", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/3460/oaks-edge-inn?page=1&scrollTo=89909"], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/SpQH8MN.jpg"], "html": "Hello and Welcome to Oaks Edge!"}}
