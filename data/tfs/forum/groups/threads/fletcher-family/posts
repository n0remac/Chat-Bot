Lock ye doors, be in before sundown, never travel alone... for if ol' Ruthless Fletcher is out of prison, then he's out for blood.\"Rodrik Fletcher.  If there ever was a 'stain' upon the Fletcher family, then it was locked away with Rodrik.  A direct grandson of Rowena herself, Rodrik grew up on the family's estates, where he enjoyed a relatively normal childhood.  He had his siblings and cousins - the Fletchers at his side as well as his friends.  But perhaps the most important person of the time was Joanna, whom he loved dearly.Joanna was not exactly a 'love interest' as one would expect from this story.  Rather, she was a young girl from a foreign country who had ridden caravans until she came to the estates.  There, eight -year-old Joanna was 'adopted' by sixteen year old Rodrik.  The two developed a close relationship over the next four years, with Rodrik acting more as a father figure to her, and Joanna acting as a daughter-figure to him.  Joanna was a good, kind girl, who was well-liked by all in the Fletcher family.But at the age of twenty, Rodrik - and the entire Fletcher family - experienced a horrific event.  Joanna was twelve at the time, still young.  She was kidnapped by a band of bandits.  The bandits were beaten back by the Fletchers, but they managed to take young Joanna.Acting out of haste, Rodrik Fletcher quickly pursued them, even though his cousins knew it was a bad idea.  Rodrik finally found the perpetrators and tried to fight them, only to fail and become injured (he received a large scar across his face).  Joanna was brutally murdered, and her killers laughed at Rodrik and fled.What began next was... not a very fun moment in Fletcher history.  Rodrik, having gained powerful, new abilities, hunted down and brutally slaughtered Joanna's killers.  He often visited his family, for he loved them very much and wanted to make sure no harm would come of them.  Eventually, only three of Joanna's killers remained, and that's where things go uglier.Fueled by the desire to keep his dark powers, Rodrik began killing anyone he ran across.  Bandits, raiders, even guards and innocent bystanders.  No one was safe, except for the Fletchers and their friends.

Born with a rebellious heart, she was the constant source of frustration, exasperation, and worry for her family as she pulled each and every trick from the book. She was wild, she was careless, and the Fletcher and Village children could always count on Rafaela to do every dare\u00a0they dared her.It's a miracle that Rafaela survived to adulthood, and Rafaela believes that she\u00a0is that miracle. She believes that Lady Luck is on her\u00a0side, and given her rake-hell, cavalier, devil-may-care attitude, she's fashioned a tidy business for herself with tomb raiding, dungeon diving, treasure hunting, and for the right price, fetching.What is Fetching? It's when someone with no balls\u00a0and lots of cash\u00a0hires someone with balls\u00a0and either no cash\u00a0or no cares\u00a0to go and reclaim an item, either from a person or a place. Sometimes, it can be as simple as going back to a family's homestead and returning a precious family heirloom that they had to leave behind in the wake of a war. Other times, it's a noble wanting to be spiteful for another and wants something stolen directly out of a person's home or business. And even more, it's someone else that wants something powerful but held in a dangerous place -- like say, a rumored dragon's lair or a mummy's tomb.Something should\u00a0be said about Rafaela's uncanny luck, however. Not only is she as nimble and sly as a cat, but she is just unnaturally\u00a0lucky. For those that are magically sensitive, they'd be able to sense something about Rafaela that ran deeper than just a magical item; it seemed to be in her blood.Which, of course, would make sense. Rafaela was left on Rowena Fletcher's\u00a0doorstep without a note. Not even a necklace. Not even a music box for which Rafaela might unravel the mystery of her parentage! From a very young age, Rafaela seemed to have an uncanny danger sense\u00a0about her, as well as perfect equilibrium and balance. Her brain seemed to have full knowledge and capacity of how her own physics would work, allowing her to attempt feats that people would balk at. In short, Rafaela learned not to trust her eyes, which could cause fear, and instead listen to her natural instincts.Like most Fletchers, she enjoys her family. And most Fletcher's know that if given the chance, Rafaela will steal\u00a0something from their home to hawk. Even though they are aware that not even Family is immune from the small, trifling, petty crimes that Rafaela is prone to, they know that if any of the Fletchers were truly\u00a0in trouble, the Fetcher Fletcher\u00a0would come to their aide.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Family Member #26..? #27...?:"}, "post-18112": {"user": "Malcolm Fletcher", "user_num": 892, "timestamp": "1449544848000", "message": "Family Member #28Malcolm FletcherMalcolm Fletcher is the father of Robert, Reynad and Ruby, and the husband of Remy Fletcher.

He had recently learned how to read, and enjoyed the brightly colored pictures and hilarious antics of the beetle. As interesting as the book was, though, it wasn\u2019t enough to distract him from the fact that this was not his room. He sighed, looking around at the cramped bedroom. Back at home, he had had his own little room. Here at the family estate, he had to share with three of his cousins. Back at home, his parents had been there. Now...they weren\u2019t. Nobody had really told him what had happened. An alchemy accident, that\u2019s all that Gran had said. They were gone, and he had to live at the estate. He had cried, of course, but that had been weeks ago. Now he was just very tired. Everything was so busy at the estate. So many people doing things, so many relatives. His cousin Roxanne, a few years older than him, had taken it upon herself to look after him and make sure he took his lessons. She had been very kind to him. However, Roxanne had friends and lessons of her own, so she was busy today. As he read his book, his cousin Riktor walked in through the door, carrying a length of rope.\u201cRoy! Do you want to go fishing?\u201dRoy looked up, startled. He liked his cousin Riktor, but he didn\u2019t like fishing.\u201cUm...I dunno.\u201dRiktor grinned, adjusting his hat. It was a floppy and wide-brimmed model, covered in fishing flies.\u201cCome on, it\u2019ll be fun! We can go down to the lake and see what\u2019s biting! I\u2019ve even got a little boat for you and everything!\u201dRoy hesitated for a moment, then noded. The two white-haired boys left the room, and headed down to the lake.---About half an hour later, Roy sat in a little rowboat floating in the middle of a large lake. He held a fishing rod awkwardly, waiting for a bite. It was a little scary being out on the water on his own, but his cousin had assured him that it would be fine.\u201cThe boat\u2019s too small,\u201d he had said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve got this rope tied to it. If there\u2019s any trouble, I\u2019ll haul you in!\u201dThus, Roy sat alone in the middle of the lake with only a bucket of bait for company. Eventually, he heard his cousin\u2019s shouting.\u201cPour the bucket into the lake!\u201dRoy was confused. Why would he do such a thing? He looked over at his cousin, who was sitting on a horse. The rope, Roy noticed, was tied to the horse\u2019s saddle.\u201cWhy would I do that, Riktor? Don\u2019t I need the bait?\u201d\u201cJust do it! The fish will come up closer to the boat to investigate and notice the bait on your hook!\u201dDeciding that the logic was sound, Roy poured the bucket over the side. The fishy chum splashed into the water, turning it a faint reddish color.\u201cThere you go!\u201dOn the shore, Riktor checked to see that the rope was tied securely to the horse.\u201cAlright, hold on!\u201dRoy wondered, briefly, what Riktor could possibly mean by that. Beneath him, the boat quivered.\u201cHuh? What\u2019s going-\u201dHIs question was answered quickly when a massive serpent burst out of the water, directly underneath his little boat. Its jaws snapped shut around him, and he was swallowed whole.\u201cWaaaa! Help me!\u201dRoy slid around inside the creature\u2019s mouth. It was surprisingly cold, and stank of rotten fish and mud. As the boat vanished down the dark tunnel of the serpent\u2019s esophagus, he decided to grab onto the creature\u2019s tongue to avoid being swallowed. Clinging to the slippery surface as best he could, he vaguely heard his cousin\u2019s voice from outside.\u201cGiddyup! Let\u2019s go!\u201dThe rope, still attached to the boat, suddenly tightened. It jammed between two of the serpent\u2019s teeth, and held fast. Roy held on tight as the creature thrashed around, trying his hardest not to get swallowed or bitten in half. Every now and then, the monster would open its mouth, and Roy would get a glimpse of the outer world. Riktor was encouraging the horse as it pulled the lake monster in to shore, as well as readying a rather large crossbow. Slowly but surely, the horse pulled the creature (and Roy) towards the side of the lake. Roy closed his eyes and held on tight, trying not to breath in too much. Eventually, he heard a loud twang and a dull thud. The jaws opened, and Riktor stood there, up to his waist in the water.\u201cCome on out, Roy. That was great!\u201dRoy carefully climbed out as his cousin held the beast\u2019s mouth open, blinking in the bright sunlight. Looking back at the creature, he saw that a massive crossbow bolt had been driven to the feathers right between the serpent\u2019s eyes. Roy shivers.\u201cThat was scary, Riktor...I could have been swallowed!\u201dRiktor shook his head.\u201cYou would have been fine. These things take a long time to digest things. I would have pulled you out.\u201dTaking the rope, he pulled the giant monster out of the lake. It was over twenty feet long, and was as thick as a cask of wine. Together, they lifted the scaly creature onto the horse and led it back. When they returned, they found Roxy waiting for them.\u201cThere you are! I\u2019ve been looking all over for-ROY WHAT ARE YOU COVERED IN?\u201dRoy looked down at himself, just now realizing that he\u2019s covered in lake monster goo.\u201cUm...a lake monster ate me. But it\u2019s fine, Riktor caught it.\u201dRoxy shook her head.\u201cSo you went to the lake and got eaten by a lake monster? Is that right?\u201dRiktor shook his head quickly.\u201cNonono, it was just a-\u201dHe was cut off by a swift punch to the face by Roxy.\u201cROY IS NOT BAIT, RIKTOR!\u201dSighing, she grabbed Roy by the hand and led him back to the estate.\u201cCome along, Roy. It\u2019s bath time.\u201dRoy nodded. It was nice to be back, and he liked baths.
