By the time Aellavel became Ni\u00f0avel, the Vellir were murderers, slavers, conquerors and corrupted against the natural order of things.A Vellir sorceress.\u00a0The Vellir can be differentiated from humans by the elven characteristics that included pointed ears and tall, more slender frames. Unlike the 'light' or 'high' elves, the Vellir can have skin tones ranging from pale white to ashen grey and shades of darker blues and purples. They lack the fairer hair colours like blonde and brown with almost all Vellir having dark black hair, though darker reds and pale whites are not unknown.\u00a0The Vellir have utterly conquered their home realm of Ni\u00f0avel, which is barely sustained by their endless fields of crop and livestock worked tirelessly by armies of slaves and workers. The surface of Ni\u00f0avel is covered in great magical towers and citadels known as the Conduits, around the bases of which great, sprawling, multi-layered cities and slums formed and became associated with the Velliran sub-factions and houses, known as 'shades'.Though all of the Vellir are united under the thumb of an elected ruler known as the Shadeking, or King of Shades, civil war and skulduggery are as common in Ni\u00f0avel as honest conversations. The Vellir consider themselves masters of the devious arts, breeding highly effective assassins and spies and training cunning leaders and diplomats to gain every advantage there is. It is nigh impossible to reach a high position of velliran society without both committing and surviving acts that would knock most sick to their stomachs, but such is the way in a world where the very act of surviving was made an impossible struggle. Militarily, the Vellir prefer raids and hit-and-run attacks over prolonged engagements, but the honourable tactics of the Aellir have not been forgotten completely. Their armies are well-trained and consist of experienced units, but despite their ability to work together the Vellir truly excel in single-combat. Created by the Aellir millennia ago, the ancient art of the Blade Dancer is taught to all Vellir who wish to master the martial arts. Said to be likened to watching a beautiful dance, one who is truly skilled in blade dancing is a fighter who is as swift and agile as he is deadly... And the art has only become more cruel with the darkening of their skies.
