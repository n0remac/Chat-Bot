Born into nobility, Brant used his power in order to build up a large estate, with several servants and serfs under him. However, his family started to fall into disarray. Even with his inherited wealth, it could not save him from his somewhat eccentric spending and gambling habits. It wasn't long before he barely had enough money to maintain his estate, and found himself under the harsh eyes of the upper government. Determined to get his family out of potential financial ruin, he researched for many months, before finding a solution in a book that had been locked away far in the back of his library. That night, he sacrificed some of his servants to summon the demon Tazirol, a powerful beast from the furthest depths. The deal was simple: For the souls of all his descendants, their family would never fall out of power. This pact was kept secret for several generations, until the family of Luther Hornraven. Luther bore two children, a daughter Gwendolyn, and a son, Bria. At this time, the family was fully involved in the art of devil worship. Several family members and servants were involved in what was now essentially a cult, with Luther leading it as their head priest. The Hornraven family was responsible for what was now years of disappearances, animal and human alike, with their wealth and power flourishing. It wasn't until an incident at the school that the children attended where an investigation was held and the family was found guilty of murder, kidnapping, and witchcraft. Ashamed, the family was forced to move away and broke apart, with Luther and his wife now living in secrecy. The Hornraven family name is now scorned, and very few, if any, of the original members carry the name. Some say that the crest itself is enough bring ill will on anyone bearing it, and their ancestral home is now empty, for fear of retribution from whatever creatures the family may have summoned in their time there.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a8/31/f3/a831f37f384d7c32b97daf39aa22c5fd.jpg"], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><font face=\"times new roman\"><font color=\"000204\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a8/31/f3/a831f37f384d7c32b97daf39aa22c5fd.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/></font><br/></font></div>"}}
