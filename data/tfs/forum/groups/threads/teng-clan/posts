The inhabitants are staunch isolationists - jealously guarding the natural resources native to their homeland.  Few outsiders are allowed within the city, but no one is permitted entry within the valley.Although rich in natural resources, the Teng Valley offers little in the way of arable farmland.  The Teng rely on herding livestock, specifically yaks and goats.  These domesticated animals provide the people with fur, wool, food, milk, and more.  Aristocratic chieftains are responsible for protecting the valley-dwellers from natural dangers, resolving disputes, enforcing the law, maintaining the land and mines, and mustering local levies.Nobles, artisans, laborers, merchants, and more reside within the city of Mabet.  Many of the resources extracted in the valley are transported directly to the capital where they are fashioned into useable items.  Traveling Teng caravans sell these high-quality items for a great profit throughout the whole of Toragana.The Teng have a small but formidable military, relying on the terrain to make up for their numbers.  As Mabet sits between two mountains, it can only be attacked from the north.  Teng cataphracts, donning heavy armor, can easily wipe away an invading army within the narrow mountain pass leading to the city.  While they may have been defeated in the open, the Teng have never been defeated within the passes, and no army has ever breached the walls of Mabet.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/tI01hgj.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/lrbNOj4.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/ogc568M.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><b><font size=\"5\"><i>The Teng Clan\u00a0</i></font></b></div>"}}
