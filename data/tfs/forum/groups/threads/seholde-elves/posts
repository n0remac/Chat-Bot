They are humanoid and have a similar range of height and weight to that of a human, though they tend towards the taller. Their skin color varies, ranging from natural colors to shades of light blue and purple. Hair color varies in much the same way, anywhere from jet black to bright white.      Similar to the Mithlonde, the Seholde have inherent arcane magic within them. This arcane energy is often small but is amplified by the ley lines that they travel on. Seholde elves that venture off of the ley lines may require more training to properly use their magic. On that note, those who are trained in magic that cast near the ley lines may find their spells unpredictable and hard to control.     One particular ability of note is that full-blooded Seholde are able to see the ley lines underneath the Earth. Hybrids may be able to sense them and follow them instinctively, but otherwise are unable to see these lines. Seholde eyes are often brightly colored and may glow.Culture    The Seholde are nomadic, traveling along the ley lines that cross the planet. These ley lines are the center of their culture, as using the magic of the ley lines is how they survive. All Seholde have the ability to use the ley lines to empower their magic, though only full-blooded Seholde are able to see the ley lines.     Despite their nomadic lifestyle, the Seholde do have a few permanent structures. These structures are always on the point where two ley lines cross, as these locations have the most arcane energy. These may be settlements by larger clans or important locations to their history.    An example of one of these locations are the few forges that dot the landscape. These forges specialize in making magical weapons or tools, often of the same crystal used to make the orbuculum, such as arrows that mark the target with some of the arcane residues of the ley lines. Any metal used in a Seholde forge is said to have more magical potential: for example, a common material is that of ley silver. Ley silver is created when a silver mine is crossed by a ley line. Due to this, the material is rare but is known for exceptional magical ability. The blacksmiths of these forges are well respected within Seholde society.     One of the most important roles in day-to-day Seholde society would be that of the mystic. Mystics are those who use Orbuculums created in pools that exist on the ley lines. The pools imbue normal stones with magical energy, and the rushing waters smooth the rocks into spheres. The stones are important in the navigation and travel of the Seholde. Any object that passes over a ley line will leave a small amount of magical residue. This residue is picked up by the Orbuculums and allows a mystic to see movement in the nearby area. A trained eye is required to accurately read and decipher the images the spheres display.    Mystic training is notoriously difficult. After years of training under a master, an apprentice Mystic must go out on their own and find their own Orbuculum. After they find one, they must navigate their way back to the clan alone. Many have been lost during this journey.     In an effort to keep their culture alive as they move, the Seholde are very traditional. Very few will ever travel too far from a ley line and even fewer will leave permanently. They live in large clans that contain multiple families. These units will often name themselves. The Seholde rarely have last names and instead, claim heritage to their clans\u201d.    This does not mean that they are completely unaccepting of outsiders. There are pockets of Seholde hybrids; that half-Seholde are allowed to travel in these clans if they are willing to be useful to the collective. Even still, a clan will almost always prioritize the membership of full-blooded Seholde.Economy    The Seholde elves rely heavily on trade to get items and supplies. The most common trade items for them are low-level magical items. Since burying an object underneath a ley line imbues it with magical energy, Seholde clans will bury clumps of cheap weapons and tools for the next clan to find. While these objects lack much in the way of genuine use, the Seholde are willing to embellish their powers if need be.     For those more respected to Seholde, they are willing to trade ley silver objects and other items made in the forges. These items are rare and difficult to make, so being given one or traded one is a sign of great respect. Location    Being nomadic, Seholde elves travel all across the world. One particular area of note is Toragana, which is home to two ley lines and a crossing location. Within Toragana is the Ascara clan, a particularly well-known clan of the Seholde.
