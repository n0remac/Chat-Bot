A company of doomed folk if ever most saw one. They were brought together by the Tiefling Julius, most of the company respect Julius for bringing them all together and giving them a purpose in life as most had thought they no longer had one. Most of the company is a mixture of Human and Fiend, however, other creatures have been seen coming and going from this company, one tale even spoke of them having a Giant, however, Tales and Legend can only truly be tested by those that dare to call for their aid. The company is known for getting a job done, no matter what the cost or how many die. The company also has a tale running around, some say that they work with demons and worship them, others say they can summon the dead if wished.\u00a0How to contact the company:\u00a0 One of two ways can be done to contact the company. Option number one is simply to ask around if anyone has seen the Shadow Crow, if it is found, it can be used to deliver a message. The second option involves using dark magic to summon the company. This can only be done by folk skilled in dark magic and has a process to follow (Will be shown if ever needed)How to join the company: It is said that the company has trials in order to test if someone way join, however, the only catch is to join the company you must be willing to promise your soul if needed and to stay loyal, no matter what you see or do. Most folk that wish to join that are oath breakers or anything of the sort shall get through their trials easily, however, those that are pure or otherwise lawful, will find themselves in terrible trouble if they attempt to join.RanksCaptain: Julius MarothOfficer: NatariaMercenary: Taurus, Victor,\u00a0AdrielRecruit:NPC'sName: NatariaSex: FemaleRace: TieflingAge: 29Rank: OfficerJob: Shadow MagePicture:Name: Taurus the SavageSex: MaleRace:MinotaurAge: 84Rank: MercenaryJob: BerserkerPicture:Name:Adriel\u00a0OrrinaSex:FemaleRace:ElfAge:36Rank:MercenaryJob: WarriorPicture:Name:Victor DesmaraisSex:MaleRace:VampireAge:340Rank:MercenaryJob: ReaperPicture:", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://d1nao0k9edgivc.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/10765146._SX540_.jpg", "https://i.pinimg.com/originals/aa/4d/25/aa4d25b0d0077144b76fd85454cecafe.jpg", "https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/castlevania/images/e/e5/Enemy_Crow_Witch_Malphas.png/revision/latest?cb=20141216015506", "http://40.media.tumblr.com/b8aed92a8a1950df790c7eb5aec62aa2/tumblr_nkg7a5Z2dC1rfyiu4o1_500.jpg", "https://i.pinimg.com/originals/64/3c/ee/643ceef6aba04c040b6dacf81e29bfa3.jpg", "https://orig00.deviantart.net/b91d/f/2013/038/b/e/minotaur_by_verehin-d5u12x6.jpg", "https://i.pinimg.com/originals/84/88/e6/8488e6b28c97c408377455a4caed63cb.jpg", "https://orig00.deviantart.net/05e3/f/2014/142/c/f/vampire_by_krizevil-d7jbo2c.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://d1nao0k9edgivc.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/10765146._SX540_.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/><br>The Shadowborn Company, is a group of folk that have lost everything, most have broken their oaths or in some way, caused their lives to pretty much be over.
