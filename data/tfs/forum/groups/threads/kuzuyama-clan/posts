They are a relatively small samurai clan dedicated to fighting off bandits and beasts in the region under their protection. When sufficiently experienced in life, as a samurai of Clan Kuzuyama it is tradition, that you train an 'Inukuma', one of the large wolf like dog-bears that roams the mountains freely but is also used in the service of Clan Kuzuyama. These creatures are often deeply perceptive and serve as a true loyal companion for the samurai - if trained properly.\u00a0The Kuzuyama revere the Inukuma believing that some truly huge Inukuma forefathers protects the mountain and live deep into the mountain range and were the parents of the ones the Kuzuyama Clan capture and train. Some of the Inukuma even has traces of magic running through their veins displaying great perceptiveness and heightened senses and resistance to the damage. The can grow very large indeed, some extending more than two meters from back to shoulder.\u00a0Kuzuyama Clan HQThe samurai live very differently from their culturally much more strict and conservative relatives down south. They have only few servants but everyone helps everyone and they are self sustaining by growing crops and hunting. In the same way they haven't got a clearly defined head of the clan, rather they have the 'Familiar Circle' that consists of five people who are from both the main Kuzuyama branch and masters and mentors, that teach the branch family and non-noble samurai among the Kuzuyama samurai. Given enough experience and will any member can gain influence and get an Inukuma.Thus the groups of the Kuzuyama Clan could be seen as this:- The Familiar Circle- Kuzuyama Clan noble- Kuzuyama Clan branch member- Non noble samurai class membersCurrent members:Furusawa Haya   - Kuzuyama Clan branch member", "link_list": ["https://flic.kr/p/KaW54z", "https://www.flickr.com/photos/137813549@N06/", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/3061/kuzuyama-clan-headquarters", "/user/2584"], "image_list": ["https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4614/28335739199_62e8b38480_z.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><font face=\"trebuchet ms\" size=\"6\"><b>\u00a0~~~ Kuzuyama Clan ~~~</b></font></div>"}, "post-79433": {"user": "Furusawa Haya", "user_num": 2584, "timestamp": "1517926857000", "message": "Name: Furusawa HayaClass: Kuzuyama branch memberAge: 29Gender: FemaleHaya's Inukuma:Haya has a relatively young Inukuma which is no more than three years old and is still not completely trained in every aspect.
