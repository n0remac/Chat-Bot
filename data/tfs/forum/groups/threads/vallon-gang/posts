The Garrison is situated on the eastern side of the city where the goods from the port first come in through the Eastern Gate, and serves a variety of substances; mostly alcoholic in nature. In the large basement under the tavern is a mostly legal fighting club, however, the majority of fights are fixed, most likely removing any legality there may have been before. In a separate area of the basement kept away from the fight ring is the cellar, where one in two kegs of beer is hollowed and used for smuggling in illegal goods.Members of both the Gang and Family are commonly found socializing and lounging in their tavern,\u00a0The Garrison. Members of the family are generally a restless lot, due to their nomadic gypsy way of life, and use this to fuel their ambition for growth and expansion throughout the Free City of Isra.HistoryThe Vallon Family was a family of poor traveling merchants/gypsies trekking across the Overworld to sell curios, magical artifacts, and their own recipe of beer. Eventually, they had been set upon by bandits; their goods were taken from them at the point of a knife and a couple of their wagons destroyed. They were left with little but their lives and each other, and a couple empty kegs of beer the bandits had drunk dry.With nothing to their name, the Vallons traveled to the prosperous free city of Isra looking for refuge. Approaching the gates, they were stopped by a shady merchant who had an offer for them. If they could sneak the merchant\u2019s goods through the gate undetected, then they\u2019d get a cut of the extra profits gained from avoiding the taxes and fees. Using their now empty barrels of kegs, the Vallon Family hid the merchant\u2019s goods within in the hopes they\u2019d not be opened during entry into the city, and smuggled the goods through the gate. The Vallons were successful and struck a deal with the merchant to ferry his goods in covertly from then on, starting a tradition of smuggling goods in hollowed beer kegs. After a long year had passed, the Vallon family saved enough to purchase a small tavern on the eastern side of Isra. There, their business turned legitimate, or so it seemed, and sold a variety of alcoholic beverages amongst other substances. The basement was cleared out and made into a fighting ring next to the guarded cellar where any and all could come and participate in the betting that took place; with the Vallons getting a cut, of course.HierarchyFamily Head(Leader)Immediate Family Member*Distant Family MemberThugEmployeeNew Blood\u00a0Associate**Member List\u00a0John Vallon - Family HeadAlmorlin Da'Lael\u00a0- EmployeeShoe-Sack Jack\u00a0- AssociateThe only identifying markers in the Gang are the bycocket felt caps with hidden razors sewn in and the marking of the Red Right Hand, often found as a tattoo on a member or paint marking their turf. New Bloods aren't given their bycocket cap until they're promoted to Thug and up, and aren't allowed to mark themselves with the Red Right Hand until their promotion. Employees and Associates go by a case by case basis to determine if they're allowed the markings.
