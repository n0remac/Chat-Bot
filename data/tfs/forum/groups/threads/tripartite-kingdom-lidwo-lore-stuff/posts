{"post-73085": {"user": "Tripartite Kingdom of Lidwo", "user_num": 2522, "timestamp": "1505576199000", "message": "History:Though records don't all align, the consensus is that the Tripartite was formed (comparitively) shortly before the cataclysm as three Royal families married with each other to produce a dynastic line, who proceeded to marry into various other dying dynasties to in a few generations gain massive land holdings. When the cataclysm finally hit, they were relatively prepared and annhillated armies both \"good\" and \"evil\" trying to cross their territory, not wanting any intruder. By this time they had long since left a bronze-age society and left old pagan beliefs. Until now they have profitted off of semi-isolation and their monarchial \"trialism.\" Defence:While having massive theoretical holdings, population and accessible manpower, resources and subsequent army, Lidwo only has a standing army of a few thousand supplemented by undocumented amounts of mercenaries. The army's pride and joy are the Winged Hussars, more or less unrivaled horsemen. The rest are part of the lower-nobility levies keeping or gaining titles thanks to service or clerics and mages, with the possibility of a siege engine or two appearing. The army consists more or less entirely of cavalry, though of medium-heavy armament rather than light horseman armies of nomads. If called upon however, a relatively large, organized, and very well equipped albeit poorly trained militia can be summoned too. Policing is seen as a task to be split amongst the military and local governance. The navy consists of massive and rather slow though steady-paced cargo ships escorted by many smaller military vessels. Economy: While having very little in the way of \"exotics,\" the extremely fertile soil, forests, and surrounding mountains insure bountiful harvests and raw materials to spare. Nevertheless, caravans bringing salt, oils, and aforementioned exotics make a key component of the economy and industry of the land.  Corporations are allowed but very controlled by the government, and foreign works are looked on with suspicion if allowed at all.Culture:Freedom of religion is a \"given\" in the Tripartite Kingdom and there is a measure of democracy in the form of the parliament or \"Sejm\" of the land. Other than that, the land is very socially conservative. It's divided into three main parts based on the three Kingdoms and various peoples living in them before the unification, called \"Galitsa,\" \"Hrudenya,\" and \"Gatyn.\" Art is generally very grounded and realistic if even if up to the creator's interpretetation, whilst music has a lot of variety though fast and extremely whiny, stringy, or other \"modern\" variety is looked down upon. Potatoes, lamb and apples are seen as the land's staples. ", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "History:"}}
