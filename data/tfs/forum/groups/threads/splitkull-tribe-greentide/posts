A rough, vicious lot, they eschew the gold lust and ambush tactics of some of the other Greenskin tribes, and hold themselves up as more purely Greenskin in manner and culture. The Splitkull value toughness, savagery, and strength in battle above all else, and thus employ full-frontal assault tactics; sending hundreds of unflinching, extremely resilient killing machines crashing into the ranks of their enemies.The Splitkull make their home at the farthest end of The Outlands in a marshy area surrounding a toxic, bug infested, putrid, tar and mud-filled hole of a swamp. This was done purposely, as the random and roaming canals that propagate out from the swamp like cracks in a shattered mirror are one of the very few passages to the open sea beyond The Outlands. Most of the other Greenskin Tribes fight for dominance of the narrow, rocky land passages on the opposite side of the landmass all of the Tide call home, but the Splitkull have become quite happy with the absolute death grip they have over passage into and out of The Outlands by sea; less competition for these passages make them much easier for one tribe to hold, and hold them they do to the last Greenskin.Cultural/Miscellaneous Notes:-\u00a0 The Splitkull are an extremely war-like race and fight amongst themselves to stave off boredom when there is no one else to fight.-\u00a0 Splitkull place almost no value on gold, silver, or precious stones, other than the occasional passing fancy for something shiny to entertain themselves with between fights.-\u00a0 The teeth of every Splitkull are constantly growing and falling out (much like that of a shark), and as such \u201cteef\u201d have been made into the only accepted currency in the tribe. If a member of the tribe wants to barter, they almost always use teef. If that member doesn\u2019t have enough teef.. Well, use your imagination.-\u00a0 The Splitkull are entirely genderless and reproduce through fungal spores shed from their bodies.-\u00a0 Splitkull fighters are normally covered in foul-smelling mud (I hope that's mud anyway), and have very few vital organs that they cannot survive without. This along with their accelerated healing/regenerating rates and high resistance to toxins, infections, and poisons make them among the most formidable adversaries.How to Join:Any PC is welcome to become a Splitkull provided they are of the Greentide race and adhere to the general outline above.Contact:For the time being, contact Splitkull Tribe via PM with any questions", "link_list": ["/user/2116"], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/G2B8ZHy.png"], "html": "<p align=\"center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/G2B8ZHy.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/><br><strong>About:<br/></strong></br></p>"}}
