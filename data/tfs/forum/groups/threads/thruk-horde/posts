Who are the Thruks? Why do they only seek to wage war upon others? How do they harness Ego, the life-energy of the world? What was their purpose, and why do they remain? I have asked the plants, but they not do remember. The plants have asked the rocks, but they do not recall.\u00a0\u00a0Even the rocks do not recall.\u00a0\u00a0~ Sage Elonarial Farulin, Lore from Gilnean.The Thruk, commonly known as Orc to the Overworlders, for those unknowing of the Thruks long origin history, and for those who believe, as the Thruks themselves do, that they were only made for War. Only the ancient and wise know that there is a greater mystery to the Thruk. No one knows how old the race is, or if they have been on Gilnean (The Thruk name for the Overworld) since before the Gods themselves. The Gods. The Ancients. Not even the World itself remembers. They just are a part of the greater mechanism of life.\u00a0 Yet, located in forgotten archives, written on half-decayed, mice eaten scrolls beneath the forgotten chambers of the Ancients, there are records of who the Thruks truly are. Yet these scrolls offer only hints, suggestions, and theories. Not that these scrolls are accessible. What little consists of Folklore amongst the Thruk speak of great Warlords, forgotten Empires, and unobtainable glory. The few that do obtain the wisdom of the Old Ones swiftly go mad, insane with the glory of the Olden Days, grief struck by the lost glory. It\u2019s no matter to most, as there\u2019s War to be fighting in.\u00a0Thruk culture is both complex and simple at the same time. For the uninitiated, \u201cMight Makes Right\u201d is all that is required to know. For those who are the strongest simply say how things are, and the weak follow. Any may challenge the strongest whenever they desire, and however they desire, as the concept of \u2018Honor\u2019 is a rarity weeded out of Thruk culture centuries ago. As long as a Thruk can proudly, and visibly, claim to be the strongest, he rules over the weak.\u00a0 But, the idea of \u2018Might\u2019 is the most complex part of Thruk way of life. How does one measure might? What is Might? The most common belief is that whoever kills the most is the Mightiest, but those with cunning, those who can manipulate the brawn into submission? What of those with the strength of MaGork, the Essence of the World? In the simplest way of thinking, the test of rulership is simply how many you can make believe you worthy to follow.\u00a0And what of MaGork, the Essence of the World? To others, it is simply known as \u2018Magic\u2019. Arcane and Divine magic has little differentiation to the Thruks, as they are both viewed as MaGork. There are very few Thruks who are able to wield MaGork, as those born with the connection to the World are far in between, and the few are rarely created in the Breeding Halls of Athen, one of the Sacred Halls. Thruks can be both created in Breeding Halls, or simply bred through intercourse. Both genders, male and female, exist within Thruk society, and are both held in the same regards and expectations. To rule, or to follow. Very few expectations exist, and those are largely dependent on the ruling Warlord who cherry picks the expectations he wants to exist. Every Warhost in uniquely shaped by the Thruk who leads it.\u00a0There are five sub-races for Thruks, each detailed below with a single paragraph. Mechanical information are detailed at the near of the document.\u00a0\u00a0Thruk\u00a0Thurk is the unifying name of the entire race. Many simply call themselves as Thruk, though some call themselves by the Sub-Racial name in order to stand out amongst the horde of common Thruks.\u00a0Half-Thruk\u00a0When a Thruk is born from a non-Thruk mother, the child becomes a Half-Thurk. They are generally accepted as \u2018Weaker Thruks\u2019 in most Warhosts, are they are often chased out of \u2018Civilized\u2019 society.\u00a0MaGork\u00a0Thruk that have access to the Essence of the World, often called Magic or MaGork, call themselves by the same name. These are generally sorcerers, warlocks, and clerics, with little definition between the three.\u00a0Hark\u00a0Hulking brutes, with wide shoulders, thick legs, and strong stomach. They are the shock-troops of the Thruk, and the most associated with the term \u2018Orc\u2019.\u00a0Snirk\u00a0The subtle, the sneaky, the stealthy. Thin, slim, and lean. They are the opposite of the Harks, armed with daggers and bows, they sneak and ambush their foes, using terror for their benefits.\u00a0Zenirk\u00a0The most common type of Thruk. What they lack is personal prowess, they make up in sheer numbers. Most warlords are eager to harness the adaptability of the Zenirk.\u00a0 The Borderlands, located north of Isra's Northern Borders, is a location mixed withswamp, caves, and cold landscape. The Thruks native homeland. It is incredibly inhospitable to everything, with acid rains and razor-edged ground. The only way to survive is to have access to caves and tunnels, and those natural \u201cresources\u201d are hotly contested for by the Thruk.\u00a0Anything built in the Borderlands will erode in time. Huts made out of leather and bone are routinely rebuilt with fresh material, swamp-tar being constantly used as thick coating to protect the leather for the acid rain. The sharp rock edges are broken with hardier metal such as iron, then smoothen out with grinding stone and acid water, gathered with stone urns.\u00a0The Barrows are expanded as required, digging deep into the softer rock and underground for metal, to be churned into the lava forges deep underground. Thruk metalworking is incredibly well refined, as the slagworkers are perhaps the most valued members of any Burrow. Metal is also raided from the Dwarves and Humans, only to be recrafted to the needs of the Thruk to raid again.\u00a0\u00a0 The Wildlife in the Borderlands is something of a uniquity. Most animals survive by using the swamp biome. Water, while drinkable, is extremely acidic, thus most animals have developed immunities from it, or have a natural filter, using the acid as spitting weapons against hostiles. The most notable Borderland animal is the Ch\u2019kir. A large lion-type animal, with hide as hardened as steel, fangs larger than daggers, and dripping acidic poison into anything it bites.\u00a0\u00a0Thruk\u2019s favored animal to breed are Northern Boars. They are usually large, quick to grow and breed quickly in large numbers. Their leather hide, meat and bone is all used in some regards, as anything wasted decreases the chances of survivability. Mushrooms, fungi, cacti and plants that require little to no water, and can grow in the dark are the only ones the Thruk farm in their underground caverns. The plants who can survive the acid rains and grow in the tough earth are grown outside.\u00a0The Thruk will generally eat anything they can get their hands on, even other Thruks if required. Their stomach acid and metabolism is so well refined that it can, and will, gain nutrients from anything. Food that\u2019s particularly rich in nutrients, such as apples, corn, and grass will send a Thruk in a state of ecstasy. Eating too much will result in a food coma, however.\u00a0\u00a0Thruks can drink the acidic rain-water in undiluted form, but only in small quantities. Extensive drinking of the rain will cause the building up acid to eat a Thruk from the inside. Water is generally gathered from the natural filters of the swamps, thus Burrows close to swamps is highly treasures.\u00a0\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://wow.gamepedia.com/media/wow.gamepedia.com/thumb/4/4d/Warcraft_III_Box_-_Orc.jpg/300px-Warcraft_III_Box_-_Orc.jpg?version=63865b3fd824e0bd3b15cc2f4d83e3a2", "https://orig00.deviantart.net/d3aa/f/2015/152/8/2/orc_by_yy6242-d8vor6n.jpg", "https://orig00.deviantart.net/9c78/f/2016/199/7/a/ms__orc_09_by_bayardwu-daaf5nw.jpg", "https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/warhammerfb/images/0/04/Black_Orc.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/280?cb=20150728054156", "https://pre00.deviantart.net/ffef/th/pre/i/2015/351/b/a/she__orc_by_morkt-d9kgyvm.jpg", "https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/wowwiki/images/1/1e/3D-Orc.png/revision/latest?cb=20090804213114", "https://i.imgur.com/Q8vnhh4.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"font-size:-webkit-xxx-large;\">The Thruk Warhorde\u00a0</span></div>"}}
