Amar was their original name, and roughly meant firstborn or people of the land. As millennia passed, the word 'amarlen' became used to describe the world in which the first Amar lived, amarlen meaning 'land of the firstborn'. As even more time passed, the meaning of amar itself simply changed to mean 'the land'. Therefore, the word amar can not only be used to refer to the Aellavel and their ancestors, but also to a region, country or 'land'. Amarlen is still sometimes used when referring to 'the world'. Eventually they adopted the name Aellavel, which has a definition somewhere between \"wise folk\" and \"fair folk\", though they sometimes refer to themselves as the \"Ellethamar\" in the ancient sense to mean \"golden ones\". Most simply refer to them as \"elves\", and those who know better as 'gold elves' or 'Elves of the Golden Woods'.A ranger of the golden woods. The Aellavel are, like most elves, are a race of magically talented immortals. They are tall and fair in beauty and power. Sickness and age cannot take them, only violence and self-will, with some aellavel who reach a great age simply deciding to move on to the next life. The Aellavel themselves are primarily peaceful in that they are isolationist and have little desire to take part in any conflict other than those that protect themselves or their homes. Next to other races there are comparatively few of them, but each are wise and strong in their own right.Many aellavel become masters of lore, music, poetry or other fine arts and most have dedicated at least part of their lives to learning to fight with the sword and bow, making even civilian aellavel relatively proficient\u00a0warriors. Those who dedicate themselves to the military usually become either wardens or rangers, with each being exceptionally skilled and more than a match for their non-aellavelian counterparts. However the true power of the Ellethamar comes from their mastery of enchantments and sorcery. Enchanters weld magic runes to armaments and places, while its sorcerers\u00a0and sorceresses spend centuries honing spells and powers to guide, heal, protect and destroy. A sorceress of Ireth Edhil.EllethamarClick here to see the thread for Ellethamar.Ellethamar, also known as Ireth Edhil. Ellethamar roughly means \"land of the golden woods\" and was the original name of the gap of land lying between the mountain ranges of Lome Garadh (Dusk Mountains) in the west, Tormen Garadh (Twilight Mountains) in the north and Londsari Garadh (Sunrise Mountains) in the east. The Elmsari (gentle-flowing) river flows through it from the northeast pass of Telemnalda out to the southwest, where it runs just west of the great mountain Lothduin and Inra Thalor, the ancient southern watchtower. When the ancient Amar originally settled there, they hid themselves from the world by planting a forest of golden trees that grew to encompass all the land between the mountains. In the eastern uplands by the border of the Londsari Garadh they built their capital city Ireth Edhil, which means \"golden woods hall\"; 'Ireth' being a mutation of 'Elleth'. Eventually the Aellavel built outposts and settlements throughout Ellethamar, which became one of the most powerful realms of the elven people.Ireth Edhil, capital of Ellethamar.Ellethamar is extremely hidden and its people elusive, especially in the modern times. No known maps of Ellethamar's true nature exist outside of Ellethamar itself, with all but the most ancient showing an area of empty woodland between the mountains. This is not only due to the density of the woods, but also the enchantments placed upon them by the enigmatic aellavel. To the uninitiated, the entire region of Ellethamar is nothing more than an empty, golden wood - one where every attempt to push further in somehow inexplicably leads you back to the borders or completely lost. Settlements and outposts are invisible, as are the Aellavel themselves, who send wardens and rangers to make sure that no-one uninvited can discover them. Even the narrow forest paths throughout Ellethamar remain inexplicably unseen, no matter if one was to be standing on them or not. Yet even so magic can be felt in those golden woods, for the weight of the elven enchantments aren't lost on even the most simple of creatures. For some reason, the woods northwest of the Elmsari River, down to the fortress Naen Serin and the village of Cyne, are much less dense than those beyond to the south and east.GovernmentEllethamar is essentially a monarchy, ruled by a Lord and/or Lady. It is uncommon for the monarchs of Ellethamar to take royal titles as they instead see themselves as protectors of the realm, though they have the power to do so if they wish. Lord Mithrinon Ningannel.The current lord of Ellethamar, who has remained so for the past 500 years, is Mithrinon Ningannel, the third of his royal house. Ningannel means 'tears of a harp' and it is said that his ancestors were once great musicians who sang tales of inspiration in dark times. Mithrinon remains unmarried and without an official heir, with the next in line to his throne being his cousin.As with most wise rulers, Lord Mithrinon often holds council with those of a trusted and influential nature. The council provides advice, criticism and more; although with Mithrinon's tendency not to interfere with what isn't broken, they do not get to exercise power as often as they might like.MilitaryThe dedicated warriors of Ellethamar are usually split between two professions: the wardens and the rangers. Both are comparatively skilled, with Ellethamar preferring to make use of a relatively low number of elite troops rather than a larger number of expendable ones.The wardens' primary duty is defending Ellethamar and acting as it's policing force. They guard Ireth Edhil and other settlements, patrol the roads between them, protect the river crossings and man the towers and fortifications. Each is highly skilled with a bow, though they also use spears, swords and shields and wear heavier armour than their ranger counterparts. The Glade-Wardens are proven wardens who are chosen to guard important people or places, such as the Lord of Ellethamar himself. A Warden of Ellethamar.The rangers are the scouts, trackers and primary offensive force. They wield dual swords, are nearly unmatched in archery and often have the skills needed to survive in the wild for long periods of time. Rangers tend to operate in smaller units than Wardens, though this is primarily due to the more stealth-driven nature of their deployment rather than any skill difference between the two. Rangers watch the borders of Ellethamar, as well as scout beyond them to foreign lands. They are also more likely to venture deep into the woods than their Warden counterparts, for they better operate in difficult terrain. Though the Aellavel do have access to horses, they are rarely used in numbers due to Ellethamar's terrain. Culture and DemographicsEllethamar has a relatively graceful culture, with fine arts, music and poetry being hobbies that most aellavel take part in semi-regularly. Known as fair and wise, tempers are rarely lost and actions committed out of anger are scorned, with most aellavel being both trustworthy and relatively charming. Murder, for instance, is seen as so heinous that Ellethamar rarely uses execution as a punishment for crime; instead exiling criminals beyond the borders of the Golden Woods. Yet despite this, most of them are learned in some form of combat and many have no quarrel with killing those that are not their own or allies. As rare as violent incursions into Ellethamar are, it is not uncommon for such invaders to be mercilessly shot with arrows from the unseen spaces all around them until none are left alive to escape. Though not warmongers, the Aellavel have no short history of war. Love and marriage are extremely important to the Aellavel. Passions for love run high, which is not only freely permitted before marriage but advocated. Yet love, to the Aellavel, is not so much physical as it is spiritual. It is not unheard of for romantic relationships to remain nonphysical\u00a0for decades, as the acts of courtly romance and the spiritual expressions of love through letters and song are just as desired and affectionate as consummation itself.A lady of Ellethamar.Marriage works similarly, with prospective engagements sometimes lasting lifetimes. Some aellavel even choose to wait entire lifetimes and make their marriage a celebration of love that has past, as much as it is a promise for the future. Even so, it is almost unheard of for wedded couples to be anything less than soulmates, and divorce is so rare that they do not even have a word for it in their native tongue.Due to the above and many other reasons, children are born quite rarely to the elves. As a people greatly in touch with the land itself, their population number is strongly tied to how much the land can support, as well as sudden traumatic drops in population. For instance, should a cataclysm occur that destroys half the aellavelian population, the remaining aellavel will naturally begin to have more children in order to quickly bring their number back up to its previous height. Similarly, if their population becomes too high, then fertility rates will drop until the time is right to have more. Even so the population of aellavel generally grows over time, increasing at a rate of roughly 10% per century. It is unknown how many there are, with estimates being no more than 30-40,000.Though the Aellavel are religious, with their own deities and shrines, they are relatively relaxed about it. Most aellavel naturally live lives that are in tune with the harmonious lessons they believe should be followed, and thus tend to show reverence to spirits in general rather than their polytheistic pantheon.LocationsIreth Edhil, known as the Golden Wood Halls, is the capital 'city' of Ellethamar. It sits in the eastern uplands, near the base of the mountains that comprise the Londsari Garadh. Londsari Garadh, known as the Sunrise Mountains, is a mountain range that takes up the majority of the eastern and southern borders of Ellethamar. Their southwestern point is the great mountain Lothduin, while to their north is the pass of Telemnalda.Nyamene is a small farming village and orchard south of Ireth Edhil. Nearby, to the southwest, is the tower of Menen Thalor.Menen Thalor is one of the great watchtowers of Ellethamar. It looks over Leren, Ered Lerene, Ireth Edhil and most of the woods east of the Elmsari river.Leren is a centrally located town in the lowlands west of Melen Thalor. To it\u2019s direct south is Lothduin, to it\u2019s southeast is Esa and Ered Lerene, to it\u2019s west is the river crossing to Cyne and to its north is the farming village Henathas.The hills of Ered Lerene.Ered Lerene is an area of hills and woodlands in the south of Ellethamar, just south of Esa and northeast of Lothduin. Ered Lerene is a place where many celebrations take place, including harvest festivals and gatherings. Many people also go there on holiday or to see the horses, which roam freely in the hills. It is considered one of the most naturally beautiful places in Ellethamar, and many natural spirits and animals reside there that attract the studious attention of the sorcerers and enchantresses of Ireth Edhil society.\u00a0Esa, a small farming settlement on the northern border of Ered Lerene that supplies many of the fresh crops and fruits for the festivals there.Lothduin is the great mountain at the southern border of Ellethamar. It is said that when the ancient Amar first came to Ellethamar, they climbed Lothduin and looked out over the gap between the mountains. It is at Lothduin\u2019s summit that they decided to settle there.Inra Thalor is a great watchtower just northwest of Lothduin, which looks out over a large portion of the southwestern border of Ellethamar. As with the others, the aellavelian enchantments have rendered it invisible to outsiders.Henathas is a large farming settlement north of Leren. To the north-east is Dirthellin, and in the northwest across the river is Serine. Dirthellin is a large farming settlement northwest of Ireth Edhil and north-east of Henathas. Like Henathas, it provides a large amount of food for Ellethamar. Eliond is the northern-most farming settlment on the eastern side of the Elmsari. To it\u2019s south is Dirthellin, to it\u2019s east is Lithcalen and to it\u2019s north, across the river, is Londor. Lithcalen is a great tower that guards the northeastern pass of Telemnalda. Telemnalda, also known as the Silver Vale, is a pass in the mountains that acts as the north-eastern border of Ellethamar. It leads into a dangerous and mountainous region full of treasures, mines and goblins.Tormen Garadh, also known as the Northern Mountains. They protect part of the northern border of Ellethamar, running concurrently east-to-west following the Elmsari river until the fort of Londor, which sits at the western edge of the mountains on the southern side. They are also directly north of Lithcalen and Telemnalda. Londor is an ancient, ruined fortress on the western edge of Tormen Garadh. It is not aellavelian in make, instead having been built by an army of humans long ago at their invitation. During this time, the world was at war and Telemnalda was commonly used by beasts in their attempt to invade and subjugate Ellethamar. A nearby human kingdom, protected from incursion by the wardens and rangers of the golden woods, offered their aid in protecting the strategically valuable pass of Telemnalda. They built and manned a stone fort, known as Londor, which protected the north-western side of the Elmsari and allowed them to quickly reinforce the Silver Vale when needed. When the war was won many years later, the humans could stay in Londor as allies and guests, but over many years this relationship turned sour as they committed crimes against Ellethamar and sought to expand their holdings. Eventually it was discovered that dark magic was being practiced there, leading to the corruption of the nearby lands and the death of several aellavel. In response the rangers of Ellethamar approached the fort under the cover of darkness, slipped inside and took the entire fortress prisoner. Those involved in practicing dark sorcery were killed, while the rest were exiled beyond the border and send home. Since then Londor has remained empty and undisturbed, slowly crumbling to ruin with the passing of time. Valinde is a farming settlement southwest of Londor and just northeast of Serine.Serine is the largest town west of the Elmsari and specializes in artistic endeavours. To it\u2019s northeast is Valinde, to the northwest is Thelhelean and to the southwest are Nehalone and Naen Serin.Thelhelean, also known as the Sorcerer's Tower.Thelhelean is the great northwestern tower that guards the northern border of Ellethamar. It is the greatest of all watchtowers and hosts a garrison of not only wardens and rangers, but sorcerers too. Some know it as the Sorcerer\u2019s Tower. Nehalone is another farming settlement, southwest of Serine.Naen Serin is the great fortress of western Ellethamar, hosting a large force whose duty is to guard the woods west of the Elmsari. The nearest two settlements are Nehalone to the northeast and Cyne to the southeast.Cyne is a farming settlement in the southwest of Ellethamar, just southeast of Naen Serin.
