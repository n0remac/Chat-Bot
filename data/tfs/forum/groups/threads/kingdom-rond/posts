With double the size of their navy now, and more people than ever seeking to expand on their sudden wealth, Rond\u00f3n has entered an exploration phase and is currently looking for those with ships to colonize in Xiomara's name.Uncharted Islands waiting to be claimed in the name of Rond\u00f3nCURRENT EVENTSThe Great War has just ended and Queen Xiomara of Rond\u00f3n     is victorious. The Rond\u00ed have conquered Zephyr, and in typical conquering fashion have already changed the names of cities and implemented their own cultural laws and beliefs on the subjugated people. The transition is not a hard one, as Zephyr and Rond\u00f3n had been neighbors for centuries and thus were aware of each other's custom, but the Zephyri are unhappy at their new occupation and are in morning for their slaughtered royal family.Zephyri Noble Families have either been imprisoned for refusing to accept\u00a0Rond\u00ed law, executed for treason, or have bent the knee to Queen Xiomara. Those who have been imprisoned and executed have had their lands and belongings siezed. Churches and temples that follow the Zephyri faith have also been razed, the buildings torn down and the stone used to patch other estates and buildings that were destroyed during the war.Those heroes that helped Queen Xiomara in her war have been handsomely rewarded, with at least an estate and a trunk full of gold. They that stayed in touch with Rond\u00f3n and intend to make their home there may have even acquired a title.\u00a0A GENERAL OVERVIEWThe Kingdom of Rond\u00f3n rules itself as a small kingdom that has just recently conquered its neighbor, Zephyr. Its new capital is called Vinicio. It is located upon the Silverfire Sea and the large Ryel River -- a river wide enough and deep enough to be able to host a fleet of ships. The main language spoken is Rond\u00ed [Fantasy Spanish], and ' Rond\u00ed ' is their cultural/ethnic/national identifier.TRADE & COMMERCEThey are primarily focused on trade, and have been known for their creation of stunning wood pieces. Indeed, wood from their locally grown Arl\u00f3na tree has been known to make beautiful furniture and is often used to decorate captain's quarters, carriages, and the like. Most Rond\u00ed\u00a0houses are made from stone, pale yellow/tan with thin veins of shimmering white in appearance, known as Rond\u00ed stone. It is as beautiful as it is enduring.Selanca also sits upon multiple gold mines, and jewelry made from Selancan Gold is famous throughout the word for its quality and its unique style. The Rond\u00ed horse is also usually in high demand. Although somewhat smaller than the large destriers from other nations, Rond\u00ed warhorses are swift and fearless, and their tighter, more compact bodies make it easier for them to navigate more difficult terrain (like forests, jungles, etc). Because of their stream-lined appearance, and the Rond\u00ed dedicated to training, they also make excellent horse-racing flesh, as well as steeds for nobility.Partners in Trade:City of Mithlonde City of Khaldaruhm  HEIRARCHY & NOBLE TITLESRond\u00f3n is ruled by its queen, Xiomara Vinicio, who herself comes from an old line of merchant lords. She is widowed, having had a husband who was known as King-Consort, and has two heirs; Crown Prince Rafael and Princess Arenna. Here, it is a little easier to make a name from yourself. Buying land and lordships is common in Rond\u00f3n, although the houses that have been around longer and have still maintained or added to their wealth are, by far, more respected. A name alone, however, does not hold sway in Rond\u00f3n, nor does gender.MAGIC & MAGICAL CREATURESRond\u00f3n has a humble school of magic, yet court and city mages are a normal position. Magic is used more-so as a tool with Rond\u00f3n's defense at its most important use. It is not very common for great magic to be found in civilian households.\u00a0Magical creatures and races have been seen in Rond\u00f3n, some more than others given their trader-like mentality. Magical creatures usually adopt the scorn or the awe as pertains to the usual Medieval Fantasy stereotypes.SEEKINGRond\u00ed Lords, Merchants and Traders are constantly hiring explorers, captains/ships, and sailors/mercenaries to expand, protect, or sabotage trade routes.Seeking worthy betrothals for the Crown Prince Rafael (19 years) and Princess Arenna (16 years)OOCOOCwise, Rond\u00f3n is based on the South of Spain, Andalucia, Sevilla, Malaga, and the like.If you would like to make a noble for Rond\u00f3n, please message!PLACES WITHIN THE KINGDOM:Under Queen Xiomara's Unquestionable ReignVinicio - the new capital of Rondon, formerly the capital of ZephyrThe Fair City of Rond\u00f3n - the former capital of RondonPort Calar - a large trade city, once under Zephyy rule, now under Rondi.The County of DeRuiz in the Kingdom of RondonDeRuiz - A beautiful city on the Joylake, centre of magic in Rondon\u00a0- governed by House DeRuizThe Duchy of Arcoux in the Kingdom of RondonThe Duchy of Arcoux - the lands Duke Nicolas Soult governs in Queen Xiomara's nameBrais -\u00a0The main city of Duke Nicolas Soult's duchy in Rondon, once a small town and now rapidly expanding.Dreigh - Once the site of horrible atrocities during the war, the Duke is currently rebuilding it from the ground up.NOTABLE PC's WITHIN RONDON:Royalty:Queen Xiomara of Rond\u00f3n Crown Prince Rafael Vinicio \"Analucia\"    \u00a0(Princess Arenna in disguise)Nobility:Duke Nicolas Soult Count Sebastian Perez DeRuiz Military:Alfonso de Rond\u00f3n Commoners:Sasha Pierce Gabriel Taurtoya NPC Account:The Kingdom of Rond\u00f3n ", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/3563/uncharted-islands-explored-claimed", "/user/2187", "/user/2272", "/user/2273", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/3560/vin-cio-capital-kingdom-rond", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/2469/fair-city-rond", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/3022/port-calar-kingdom-rond", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/2766/deruiz-rond-territory", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/3561/rondon-duchy-arcoux", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/2967/brais-contested-territories-rondi-occupation", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/3023/dreigh-rondon-soults-duchy-territory", "/user/2187", "/user/2219", "/user/2857", "/user/1586", "/user/3508", "/user/2776", "/user/2292", "/user/2775", "/user/2185"], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/3YqEpqx.jpg"], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><font size=\"3\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"364\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/3YqEpqx.jpg\" width=\"546\"/><br/></font></div>"}, "post-77706": {"user": "The Kingdom of Rond\u00f3n", "user_num": 2185, "timestamp": "1515535039000", "message": "Want to forge a name for yourself, gain land and glory -- and gold?
