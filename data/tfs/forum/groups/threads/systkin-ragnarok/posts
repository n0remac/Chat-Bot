Among each other they are peaceful, but outsiders may find themselves unwanted, as no common Viking would have anything to do with a foreigner unless there is a beautiful woman among their party. Magic is another thing unwanted and warrants for lynching or death if used for anything but serious healing. The Seven Virtues are still a mainstay.  To best summarize the current culture, they hate anything not them and magic; and, they believe they are the perfect warrior race and the fifth Element that united the four main elements to initiate Ragnarok.Houses:B\u00e6rofridr - House of WarBearfridr - House of PeaceRegginkunnr Systkinholl - Hall of Divine Brothers and Sisters.

Maginium creates an explosive force against anything magically enabled that it hits. The harder he hits, the bigger the bang. Against an armored non-magic user, it is a strong war hammer with no special abilities.Side Weapon(s): Short handled battle axesHistory/Biography: Argimos started as a farmhand on his father's farm. His father was a jarl based on his raiding abilities and originally used Fornharnarr, the 'ancient hammer' passed down from father to son when the father dies and the son becomes the next jarl over the Sikdeutch House. The hammer found the hands of Argimos on his twentieth birthday. For some time the Sikdeutch House was in shambles when they found out one of their own was a traitor. From that day forward, Argimos was a raider of a different breed than his father; as in he didn't rush in blindly on his enemies.Argimos was given the nickname 'One Horn' not because one of his helms horns was broken, but because the one full horn he has left was ripped from the head of a Manticore sent by foreign enemies. This statement made Argimos one of the most notable Jarls in his recent ancestory. When Argimos isn't raiding, he can be found working his land or exploring unknown lands. Beneath his rough exterior is curious child.Despite the cruel facts that forced him to leave his homeland, he was eager to leave an explorer the unknown world beyond the miseries of his homeland and the cruel memories of his past.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/277563407207628802/280194219212144640/BadassViking_zpsa7daff7b.png"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><font face=\"courier new\"><u><b><font size=\"4\"><br><br/>Name</br></font></b></u><font size=\"4\">: Argimos 'One Horn' Sikdeutch</font></font></div>"}, "post-60369": {"user": "Iruka Naudir", "user_num": 1811, "timestamp": "1487532194000", "message": "Name: Iruka NaudirClass: Mystic - ShapeshifterRace: Human Gender: All (Assumes Male form most of the time)Height: VariableMain Weapon: Skofnung - \"Soul Dagger' - forged from a rock that fell from the heavens, discovered by an ancestor of Iruka, passed down through generations. The blade is ornately decorated with a design that resembles a Hercules Beetle.

If dealt a mortal wound it can remove one's own soul, the physical body will then begin to deteriorate if the soul remains separate for 2 weeks. This dagger is rarely used at all.History/Bio: Iruka comes from a family of huntsmen who a long time ago discovered a crashed meteoroid and made a dagger from some of the metal inside. The dagger had the ability to grant powers, but for the past 3 generations nobody had such powers. Iruka gained his alteration abilities when his father Hendrix Naudir accidently sliced his own hand with the dagger, he and Iruka became ill. Hendrix died from the illness but Iruka lived and learned that he now had the power to alter physiology. Iruka's shapeshifting is a well kept secret.

This hammer turns magic into ice. If it hits a manic user, the magic freezes like water and causes the magic user to freeze from the inside out. It not uncommon for mages to physically explode from the conversion of magic into ice. Many may consider this weapon to be magical, but it is actually anti-magic. If the enemy has no magic, they are hit by the hammer and the sharp crystals the make it up.Side Weapon(s): Eye of Hel - a shield that produces the same effect as Fornharnarr of Skadi if magic contacts it. If the shield is used as a weapon, it is a normal shield, but if the user is using it for defense, anything magical instantly freezes and falls to snow.History/Biography: Formerly known as the Goddess, Hel, daughter of Odin. Hela chose her side with Fadir and Modir when the Goths prophesized the Aesir attack on the travelling Norse. She now serves Modir in the Snjar Fjall as the Guardian of Skadi, goddess of the mountains and heart of the Tree of Life. Only if war reaches the Garden of Valhalla, will she leave the mountains.\u00a0Hela is a calm spirited woman who loves all and believes that any who favor Fadir or Modir should be reborn. In many ways, she is still over Hel, but at its gates in the living world. She has no magical powers besides a resistance to cold due to her nature and where she lives.Norse Mythology in Reality::\t(Hela) The Nordic Crone Goddess of the Afterlife whose abode was Niflheim. As Queen of the Underworld, it was said that she received the spirits of the dead, housing them in the elder tree until it was time for them to be reborn. In Denmark, she was worshipped as Hyldemoer (Elder Mother). She was also seen as the Mountain Mother, dwelling in the earth where fire and ice meet.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/0b/40/45/0b4045fa4bef190546b6c98d50a1a885.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><b>Name</b>: Hela of Modir</div>"}, "post-61787": {"user": "Agnar Lothbrok", "user_num": 2150, "timestamp": "1489988552000", "message": "Character sheet coming soon!\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Character sheet coming soon!\u00a0"}}
