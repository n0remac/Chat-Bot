They are lead by Purge, the Ethereal King who moulded the lost souls of the realm into new beings of energy.Wisps-\u00a0Wisps are the child form of the ethereals, freshly formed and small. They often travel to Overworld for easy access to safe energy. Wisps can grow to be 1 meter in diameter and come in a variety of colors. Their color flickers when they speak or go through mood changes.\u00a0Ethereals-\u00a0Once a wisp has gathered enough energy, they mature into a larger being of energy. Once they become big enough, they need to undergo a ritual to bind their bodies and stabilize them. Ethereals are usually seen wearing magical wrapping that make them look like mummies, this wrapping keeps their body in a solid form. The Ethereals average to be 6 feet in height and come in a variety of colors, keeping the color they had as a wisp. If you were to feel the body of an ethereal,you'd find it feels like humming glass with a static over the surface.History of Etherealm-\u00a0The chaotic Etherealm was once one of order and peace. Over a millenia ago the realm that neighbored Overworld was called Seido, it was a world of philosophy and the arts. Contact with the Overworld was still as little as it is today, but the greatest of magical minds were able to explore each of the realms and meet their neighbors. Tales of Seido had been told over the years and many overworlders thought of it as a Paradise, a heaven that Overworlders would love to see, with the alien Seidons seeming like heavenly beings though they were in fact equals. At the time the realm of Seido was whole and solid, but this would not last.The dawn of the Cataclysmic Age spelled doom for the realm of Seido. Seido and Overworld were such close proximity of eachother that some parts of their worlds were connected, if you found one of these intersections you could open a doorway and just walk into the other realm. Through these areas, even disasters from either realm could cross over.\u00a0(Below: an inaccurate model of the proximity of 3 realms. Hellscape is below Seido and Overworld and does not have intersecting borders. The two higher realms are depicted as a Venn Diagram, the dark purple in the middle being the crossroads of the realms where you can travel between them like a bridge connecting two islands)The Overworld had erupted into a war over powerful magic artifacts, the war concluded with a massive disaster created by those who held the artifacts. The disaster caused other disasters that rippled across the realm that also crossed through the bridges and poured into Seido from multiple entry points, the immediate cataclysm echoed through Seido until the world exploded, killing all of the Seidons. The realm formerly known as Seido was now heavily irradiated, clumps of energy that used to be contained in the realm now swirled around the space and gathered into stars. Chunks of earth had been blown around and now gravitated toward eachother, forming islands. Seido was now Etherealm.Throughout the realm, life found new ways of surviving in the new chaotic landscape. The flying creatures thrived or adapted to gathering energy that floated through the realm, those that had grown to be bigger would be able to survive larger sources of energy and some didn't even have to hunt, they'd just float around in the energy clouds filter feeding. The trees on the islands evolved to be patient predators that snatch creatures from the sky and squeeze them into juice. The plants in the ethereal realm would seek out nearby islands and attempt to grow toward them to connect the islands and gain access for more land to place roots and spread. Parts of civilization in the realm were now abandoned ruins.\u00a0The souls of the Seidons were still out there though, most of them had become part of the energy clouds, floating with the spiral tide of space. Some had passed through to the Overworld and sometimes souls from the Overworld wander into Etherealm. For centuries the souls and energy clouds mingled, eventually a strong enough consciousness formed and learned to create a new body, this was Purge. After creating his new body he wandered for centuries further gathering power to become stronger and stronger. He searched for the lost souls and sheparded them towards the Castle of\u00a0Karastrasz, a Twilight Dragon that had claimed dominion over what was left of the realm. The Twilight King's Castle sat on one of the largest islands in the realm, and Purge needed it. Purge killed the dragon king, absorbed his power, and took hold of his territory. In this castle Purge gathered souls and energy until he had enough to begin trying to replicate the process that he'd gone through, to revive his people. He was successful in sifting through the energy and getting it to collect and form an individual, a Wisp. Purge created many more Wisps and tought them to gather their own energy to become powerful enough until they can go through a metamorphosis and fully form a new body.\u00a0Now that Purge has been creating bodies for the lost souls, he has to deal with making sure they can survive in the new chaotic realm. His people needed to become warriors to grow and control what little land remains, and so they did so. They have mastered the new environment, and thrive, but they cannot do it forever. Eventually there will be no more land, all that remains breaks up as time passes or is destroyed by creatures. Purge also needed to avenge his people, the Seidons who were killed because of the Overworld's recklessness. His grudge goes toward his goal now of punishing the Overworlders by taking their land and show them the chaos that he'd endured for a thousand years.Known Ethereals: Vigil   , Purge   , Sign, Gate(dead), Ray, CinderAllies:\u00a0Grandma   ,\u00a0Aetherdae ", "link_list": ["/user/544", "/user/456", "/user/2613", "/user/602", "/user/700"], "image_list": ["https://ak0.picdn.net/shutterstock/videos/6441770/thumb/1.jpg?i10c=img.resize(height:160)", "https://i.imgur.com/XpiGlEk.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/z2EnNB8.png", "http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/sacrifice-shiny/images/0/09/MS-01-IM-01.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110827130359", "https://i.imgur.com/LVfhVXG.jpg"], "html": "The children of Purge are the Wisps and Ethereals, natives of the Ethereal Realm.
