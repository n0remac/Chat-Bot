Its a repository for all the unwanted waste of other nations. Even worse, its controlled in the north by a group of equally irredeemable aristocrats; or at least that's the word they've chosen to describe themselves. 'Ghouls' is more appropriate. Describing them as simple kidnappers, murderers, and grave robbers would be to cast them in too favorable a light, though they are guilty of these crimes and worse.One of the more heinous crimes perpetrated by the inhabitants in Stathmore to the north is the slave trade. Humans and elves are rounded up in the south against their will, and hauled north to be broken, brainwashed, and beaten into slavery. That's where the Helmfirth Human Resistance comes in. Despite our name, we are an organization of humans, elves, and non-humans that work in secret to free and transport slaves in the north back to the relative safety of the south of Helmfirth, where they will hopefully choose to leave the nation altogether.Our symbol is three circles or three spheres grouped together, each one representing the parts of our organization: humans, elves, and all of the remaining species of being. This symbol has come to mean safety and shelter for the slaves in the north, and comfort and camaraderie for those of us who count ourselves part of the resistance.\u00a0Members of the Helmfirth Human Resistance:It is worth noting here that the HHR does not currently have a \u00a0real command structure, but more of a loose collection of senior members, members, and friendlies.Senior Members:\u00a0 (Long-time members of the resistance, familiar with its inner workings. They lead missions, meet with friendlies to arrange safehouses, and see to the overall strucutre - such as it is - of the HHR.)Isaac Aldre Ingrid, the Masterslayer Members:\u00a0 (Dedicated to the resistance, members are the backbone of the organization. They move freed slaves, run businesses that help to fund the resistance, and are responsible for the day-to-day operations.)Friendlies: \u00a0(Normal citizens of Helmfirth that offer material and moral support to the resistance. Their houses are the safehouses, they run minor errands for the resistance, and help in any way that they see fit.)Shenk(To join the resistance, PM this account.)", "link_list": ["/user/2463", "/user/2453", "/user/2428"], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/B075m2n.png"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/B075m2n.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/></div>"}}
