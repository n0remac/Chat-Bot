The dungeon master's guild is comprised of writers who seek to enrich our roleplay setting by offering their service as \"writers for hire,\" so to speak. I've seen a number of players struggle with creating their own full stories, even with so much raw creative talent as we find ourselves around on TFS. I, myself, have sat at a blank screen wondering how I should have an NPC interact with my main character--- and every result seems dull, at least to myself. That's when it hit me. What if someone else could \"act\" as my NPC? Not a full-blown character, something a little less far off? What if you wanted your group to fight a few ruffians, but would like to enjoy the brawl yourself? How about chasing a thief that snatched your purse, but really wanted to actually feel the thrill of a chase instead of scripted content?Or to flirt with a pretty tavern maid, but want find out exactly how smooth your character really is?Maybe even to find some treasure and have the contents be a mystery?\"Look no further, The DMG is here and happy to offer that much need unexpected punch to your writing experience.    Requesting A DM.

Let's take a look at what all that actually means. As a member of the DMG you are offering your services to players to help further THEIR stories. This guild's purpose is to help craft rich and beautiful works of art with our fellow writers, not tear them down senselessly. Does this mean the good guy (Player) always win? No, but it means we do not go out of our way to destroy a story before it's meant to be destroyed.( Unless the player request that) Does this mean we can not promote our own areas and questlines? Yes. We have sections where a solo user can post their own quest and stories already, use those resources. If you wish advertisement for a quest or one-shot mission, you could request such from the guild to keep on file, and if there is a situation where a player is just looking for a story, they can be directed to your Main profile. Main profile? Yes, main profile, all Guild post are done under a Guild pen name, each with their own ID number, The guild is to remain as anonymous as possible to promote a focus on the stories rather than the writers. Each Pen name will be given a section on the guild page to post a \"profile, writing sample, and player testaments.\" to help promote your writing within the guild. each guild member's section will note their time in the guild, number of \"request filled\" and Guild rank.( Applicant, novice, apprentice, journeyman, and master.) How do I gain rank? By being a good GM of course, there is something to be said by post quality and content. Guild rank reflects how the guild sees your efforts and time spent. Now that we have chatted a bit about the guild, here is the application. Yes, there is an app, it is more of a gauge of where you are as a GM and writer rather than a \"pass/fail\" entrance exam, so no worries. ( There is not a form for this currently if you are interested please send a PM and your interest will be noted.)\u00a0SPOILER: Click to showGUILD APPLICATION  These applications are kept on file and will not be accessible to the general public, guild members or players. These applications will be reviewed by the guild lead and administration.
