Falling somewhere in between, they have proven themselves to be a unique species of humanoids. Some decide to settle, while others travel far from their homelands. At times they can be as vicious and reclusive as wild animals, yet there are those that are as cunning and intelligent as any other civilized race.Variants of the species exist from one group to another. From the snowy, thick-furred vulx of the brisk highlands to the sandy, fleet-footed vulx of the desert, they have adapted graciously to their surroundings. They have the ability to survive in especially difficult and inhospitable environments. Even when limited with materials, their resourcefulness is uncanny, expressing a technically complex mind. Cheerfulness in trying times is prized by the vulx. They give gifts of food and share labor equally among each other as well as with strangers. Sharing information with each other is also essential to their survival. Several traits are shared between all vulx: they resemble humans with foxlike feet from the knee down, ears, a tail, and tiny black claws on their hands. Facial features can have subtle differences, such as larger eyes or the petite, curved nose and lips that resemble that of a fox. Otherwise, they are completely indistinguishable from a human\u2019s.The vulx have created societies, but they are not a cohesive people. One will often meet those who have no knowledge about others of their kind, though it would seem that they are drawn to one another; there is often the sense that they are connected through magic. Encounters between different subspecies of vulx is rare, but not unheard of.All vulx carry within them the potential for wild, natural magic. Controlled by emotion, they conjure phenomenon from the heart, but a lack of mastery can lead to self-destruction. Vulx who understand this relationship between them can find each other through vast distances.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/R4m6bhi.png"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><font size=\"5\"><font face=\"georgia\">The Vulx<br/></font><span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><br/></font></div>"}}
