Leandros, wherever his home had laid, led a band of the \"Brave Men\". These men, armed with swords and fire, fought against the forces that plotted to overthrow and destroy their homes. Upon the field, the brave men were soundly defeated and cast into a full retreat at the might of Chaos. Leandros was one of the lucky ones, felled by a jagged blade, upon the grass.\u00a0But Fate had different plans for Leandros, as he rose from the ground, mere minutes after taking the fatal wound. Eyes emanating\u00a0pure light, from his back unfolded\u00a0wings of gold. Leandros, now risen, splayed his hands outward, hurtling himself into the air with a flap of his powerful wings. Unleashing a torrent of saintly lightning, he burned the enemy to ash, leaving nothing more than smoldering piles.\u00a0Leandros, The Living Saint, then set up his own church. The established church worshipped an entity above Leandros, at one point, but the modern church now reveres Leandros as a God in the flesh, made living, an avatar of the Light.
