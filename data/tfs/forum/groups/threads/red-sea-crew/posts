Clothes and equipment:On a normal day, you'd see him fashioned with loose garments mixing a short-neck shirt with flowing leather vests. Thin linen pants, rolled up to his knees, strapped by a thick leather belt with a heavy metal buckle. Strong enough to hold his rapier and daggers.At sea,\u00a0he wears a tricorne hat to cover from the sun and rain, as well as a length of rope on his lower back for emergencies. As weapons, he uses a rapier, as well as a few daggers strapped and hidden in different places. Besides that, he has three small pouches. Coin, Qat, and a third one he rarely uses.
