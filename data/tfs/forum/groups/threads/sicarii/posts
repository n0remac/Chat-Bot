For OOC questions or comments, this thread in particular can be used, or a message can be sent to GraciosaIscariote or this posting profile, SicariiImperium.DescriptionThe origins of the Sicarii are obscured in history, but many spill rumors of their ranks \u2013 from priests, to assassins; necromancers and mages. Behind and between most gossips is their clandestine ways of terra-forming, metaphysical power, and dark technology.Up until now, they have traveled around operating in the shadows, a disconcerting legend among brighter civilizations. Seeking out places that were most advantageous and susceptible to corruption. It is not a secret that they worship primordial gods, practice blood sacrifice, and collaborate in hive-mind. Many of the prominent members descend from draconic bloodlines. The Sicarii have devoted their lives to the adulation of diverse cosmic and worldly serpent gods -- seeking favor and power to be imparted upon them. A primal, multifaceted pantheon commands their deeds, and evolution.  While many have attempted to epitomize the faction as wicked, it is far from the truth. They are not \"immoral\", but instead practice a deep understanding of carnal existence, primordial energy, the mysterious evolutionary vigor of entropy that permeates all of nature and furnishes the drive for survival and proliferation. They trust themselves to be the dark evolutionary force that forces those around them to become strong, as well as their own members. Guilt and shame are concepts deemed \u201cweak\u201d, resulting in an individual who is exploitable based on their ego.
