it is a center of commerce, politics, military, and culture.\u00a0 The Jarl of Stormhold is colloquially known as the High King of Asgeir, although the title is merely that: a title.\u00a0 The city is protected by the legendary Stormguard.Seaholm\u00a0- The northernmost settlement of the Varan in Asgeir.\u00a0 Seaholm serves as a major commercial port and is the first line of defense against invasion form the north.\u00a0 Seaholm is protected by the Seaguard.Valland Hold - Ancestral homeland of Clan Valgard.\u00a0 Currently ruled by Jarl Aesa Jojora.\u00a0 Ralf Valgard is the heir to Wulfenheim Hall.\u00a0 Valland specializes in farming, hunting, logging, and mining.\u00a0 It is protected by the Wolfguard.Wulfenheim\u00a0- Capital of Valland, and seat of Clan Valgard.The Blackened Bitch\u00a0- Local inn at Wulfenheim.The Shattered Peaks\u00a0- Wilderness", "link_list": ["/user/520", "/user/640", "/user/451", "/user/927", "/user/3253", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/3382/asgeir-seaholm", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1293/valland-wulfenheim", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1267/valland-blackened", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/3172/valland-shattered-peaks"], "image_list": [], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><font size=\"5\"><i><b>Asgeir</b></i></font></div>"}}
