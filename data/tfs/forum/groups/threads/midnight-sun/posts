{"post-20691": {"user": "The Starlight Dawn", "user_num": 813, "timestamp": "1452120431000", "message": "(The Midnight Sun Logo)The term \u201cThe Midnight Sun\u201d refers to both the establishment bearing that name, and the group that runs it. This thread is intended to state some information about the group, and detail a few things about the way things are done. Keep in mind, most of this following information is not public information in character, so unless your character has been told about some potion of this information by someone who is in the know, they have no excuse to know the following information. It is, however, understood that any character formally employed by The Midnight Sun has either been told, or has learned this information during their employment. (With the exception of information specifically marked as such.)It is known to all who visit, that The Midnight Sun uses a unique in-house currency, called Midnight Sun Tokens. These coins come in four denominations, each one increasing by a magnitude of ten. In order of least to most valuable, they are called Moons, Suns, Eclipses, and Novas. The Midnight Sun logo is present on all denominations of coin. Only these tokens are accepted as payment for services within the Midnight Sun, with the one exception being the bar. At the front desk, one may speak with the exchange clerk to exchange anything of value for Midnight Sun Tokens, including other currencies, jewelry, solid metal, as well as other things, like souls. (Soul buying prices are dependent upon the quality of the soul in question.) Exchange is also possible in the other direction, one may exchange tokens for the major currencies of the world. The exchange rate is reasonable, and if one were to do the math, they would find all services fairly priced.For purposes of cost estimation, one Moon may be considered approximately equal to 1 USD. One Sun is approximately equal to 10 USD, etc.The group uses a unique system of enchanted gemstones to communicate telepathically. All members wear on their person, a purple gem. Every employee may choose how to wear their gem, be it embedded into a bit of jewelry, on a piece of clothing, in a trinket or weapon, or on a piercing. To function, these gems must be within a close proximity of the wearer, the optimal effect is achieved when the gemstone is touching their skin. When the gems are functioning, they glow a bit, and allow telepathic communication. The communication can be proximity based, directed to a singular individual, a small group of chosen individuals, or sent to the network at large. In most cases, the enchantment is of low power, only allowing auditory communication. This is to prevent abuse, and to allow the gems to avoid interfering with other magical effects.Those who do have magical sight or other magical detection abilities may notice the gems in their non-operational state, though they could easily be overlooked due to the low power. However, when the gems are functioning, a greater amount of magic is in play, making them much more easily noticeable. Some time early in their employment, almost all employees receive lessons in the proper usage of their gems from Mr. Crenso, who also manages the network. It may be assumed that all employees both wear a gem in some way, and are competent in using them to send messages.Additionally, all Midnight Sun Employees, as part of their employment, are offered food from the kitchen for free. Employees that require special nutritional accommodations, like vampires, for example, also have case by case special arrangements. Midnight Sun Employees are paid bi-weekly, every other Friday, in tokens. Salaries are relatively high, especially when compared with comparable positions with other businesses, and keeping in mind that housing arrangements and food are provided separately, and not charged for. Percentage based raises are awarded yearly, based on performance, and additionally on special occasions such as a particularly outstanding achievement.The wait staff may choose to take tips from their customers, but are paid enough that any tips are merely supplementary income. Most employees choose to take their salary in tokens, and most choose to save the majority of their accumulated funds, not needing to spend much on a day to day basis.Midnight Sun suppliers aren\u2019t paid on the same schedule as employees. Suppliers are paid immediately upon the delivery of their goods, based on how many goods they\u2019ve delivered. In working out a supply agreement, TMS and the supplier work out a list of things the supplier is to supply, how much they\u2019ll be paid for each type of good (as a unit price), as well as how much of each good TMS expects them to deliver, and when to make the delivery. The unit prices agreed upon in the initial contract are highly negotiable if the quality or scarcity of the goods in questions changes during the duration of the contract. Good suppliers are often awarded incremental increases in unit prices. Some suppliers choose to be paid in tokens, others choose to take gold bits. That choice is up to the supplier as the deal is being made initially. Most suppliers bring their ingredients on carriages or carts to an unloading dock at the back of The Midnight Sun Establishment, where unloading employees unload their cart, measure the volume of goods, and pay the supplier on the spot. Kate Green, by special arrangement due to the legally questionable nature of some of the goods she provides, also has a garden in the basement, where she grows some of the goods she sells. However, the procedure is largely the same, even if the locations are not. All Midnight Sun employees are offered, upon their employment, a room of their own within the establishment. The majority of these rooms are located on the second floor. The player character employees who currently reside in second floor rooms are as listed below in no particular order. Skarlet Alden Marshal Cyronin the Blue Kevin Odric Belthron Tick Davous the Black Additionally, the administrative staff of The Midnight Sun have their offices on the third floor. Attached to each office is a room like the ones on the second floor, intended for the owner of the office to live in. The list of player characters that make their home on the third floor is as follows.Empress Naoki    & Artemis   (Shared six room suite)Reese Cresno Grandma Maelik The Fellblade Large underground areas lie beneath The Midnight Sun, primary accessible through a large, locked metal door in the Employees Only section. All information regarding this system of basements is given on a need to know basis. Currently, there are two topics that represent this area. Hasdrubal\u2019s Lair and Kate\u2019s UndergardenIn addition to the specific areas represented in those two threads, a number of other basement locations exist, but have not been detailed in RP yet. To preserve the mysteriousness, and to be lazy, I will not detail those locations here, save to say the following. The accumulated wealth of The Midnight Sun is stored, at least in part, below the establishment. And additionally, there is a tunnel, connecting the basement of The Midnight Sun to The Black Tower. This thread will be updated sometime in the future with more clarification and information. If you have any questions, please ask.

It was founded in partnership with Calico Swartz  with the intention of appealing to the upper class of Isra; the ministers, merchants, mages, and other wealthy individuals. Though The Midnight Sun proper has the facilities and offerings to appeal to those sorts of folks, its location in the Nexus, and majority of clientele (as commoners) unintentionally drive away most wealthy individuals. Thus, The Moonlight Eclipse was created to take advantage of the upper class market. The concept was conceived by Madame Naoki in cooperation with Calico Swartz in an exchange beginning on page 24 of The Midnight Sun, and mostly taking place on page 26. Calico personally funded the construction of the establishment, and as investor, gets a percentage cut of the gross earnings. His status allows him a reasonable degree of influence in how the place is run, but ultimately the staff are Midnight Sun employees, and will answer to Madame Naoki over Calico. All activities on the main floor, though perhaps irregular or indecent, salacious or scandalous, are not technically illegal.Though, the VIP lounge beneath The Eclipse does indeed offer a number of illicit and illegal services and  substances, but never directly by an employed staff member, and never outright. You\u2019ve got to ask the right person. If confronted about the topic, most staff members will claim no knowledge of such activities, and direct the questioner to a manager. The kitchen of The Moonlight Eclipse was constructed to the description of Maelik The Fellblade , who has also trained the chefs who work it, and sometimes may decide to work personally. As such, the food is of the highest quality. Most of the art adorning the walls of The Moonlight Eclipse, including the portrait of Calico, was painted by Raulio Fletcher , as part of his agreement with Madame Naoki.  (Art is subjective, so I can't tell you about its quality, but it's generally regarded as at least decent.)

After his master died under suspicious circumstances, Alan set out on his own. Unfortunately, the economy was not kind to startup poisoners, so Alan decided to use his skills for something a little more marketable: bartending.

She became a nun at age 19, blending in with all the others and praying and doing other nun things.

She'd never had any choice in the matter, and had never thought as to whether she wanted this life or not. She hadn't chosen the nun life. The nun life had chosen her. Ellen realized how bored she was with her routine, and so she snuck out of the convent in the middle of the night without leaving so much as a note. Six days later, she was sitting in a tavern when a group of nuns from her old convent walked in. They spotted her immediately and surrounded her, pleading for her to return. She refused, and they tried to grab her and drag her back against her will. After a short and messy fight, Ellen managed to escape, stealing a horse and riding off into the night. For the next four years, she dodged countless attempts by her former sisters to capture her and bring her back to the convent, forcing her to fake her own death in a house fire to escape the nuns. She eventually made her way to Isra, where she found a job as a bartender.
