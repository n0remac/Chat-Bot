Servants and slaves, they nonetheless are deemed trustworthy enough to work for their lords and ladies. Thralls are often those offered the gift of revenantism for outstanding service.Night Creatures: from living stone gargoyles to snake-creatures, bat-men and flesh-eating monsters, the Night Creatures are deemed to be wild beasts allowed to roam the grounds. Their loyalty can't be guaranteed, but they can be controlled as fearsome pets by the more powerful revenants.Ghoul: mindless undead caring for nothing more than eating the flesh of the living, they are the result of a revenant draining a mortal of all blood and allowing them to die afterwards. A ghoul will then wake, a mindless servant to its killer and perfect front-line fodder.Cattle: little more than slaves, these mortals are kept to satiate the desires of a revenant and wait upon them hand and foot.
