The men and women of the Hetamanate live in the far northern steppes, hunting the animals that live in the mountains. They act as guides, and as a mercenary\u00a0force, though the last time a Hetman was called for service was long ago. This does not diminish the warrior aspect of the tribe, having fought in multiple border skirmishes\u00a0and battles.\u00a0The Free Men are somewhat nomadic, a couple years before the present time, Hetman Denisov declared he and his followers would pitch their tents for the last time, and erected a city of wood. Peasantry and nobleman alike made the city of Vil'nih a reality. The city is located far North, nestled between three mountains.\u00a0GovernmentThe Free Men swear fealty to Hetman Svetomir Denisov, the eldest, and wisest, of the Free Men. As head of state, the Hetman has the final say on all disputes and is the highest law in their land.\u00a0ReligionAll Free Men believe in their Lord, God. His story and their subsequent beliefs are written in a book, which is not unusual for a family to own, peasant or noble. This, in turn, raised the literacy of their people, turning the young men and women into moral adults. The Hetman is the supposedly the most pious and ardent of believers, and the piety of a man may swing the election in their favor.\u00a0The Father, Son, and Holy Spirt of the Free Men's Orthodox religion represent three distinct individuals, with no overlap or overlay between the Trinity. \"And we believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver-of-Life, who proceedeth from the Father, who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified, who spake by the prophets. And we believe in one, holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church. We acknowledge one Baptism for the remission of sins, and we look for the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come. Amen.\" - Popular Prayer.SocietyIn the society of Free Men, standing is determined by the wealth of the family in question, peasantry\u00a0to pseudo-noble families. All are required to serve the Hetamanate to their last breath, in which they swear upon the Cross they wear around their necks. The men toil and labor while the females find traditional roles, though they are not strict about these roles, and females may be found in a hunting party or cavalry charge.\u00a0Since most of the Free Men can read and write, those within the limits of Vil'nih have access to basic schools, usually their local church, with the word of their God reinforced from a young age. All are encouraged to visit the learning centers until of age to fight and labor.\u00a0The Free Men have a standing army, consisting of cavalry, and horse archers. The crack lancers of the Hetamanate are to be feared, as weekly training for every regiment has sharpened the experience\u00a0of their soldiers. A roundabout charge of rank after rank slamming against an enemy is their\u00a0main tactic. If an enemy has a shield wall, they simply harass them with arrows until they tire of it and leave, or they break line and charge, which is punished heavily by the lancers.Piety and religion has a concrete place in the tribe, even when they were nomadic, keeping the men and women together with a common interest and moral code.\u00a0The men and women hunt the mountains that surround Vil'nih in hopes of gathering food not already provided by the herds they keep. The largest and most dangerous of game are killed as trophy's, and a testament to the hunter's prowess in battle. The hide of a sabertooth would be enough to raise a man to an officer rank.NPC'sHetman Svetomir DenisovOldest, wisest, and pious. The hardened warrior Svetomir was raised and had watched in the hardest times the tribe has faced, in the harsh winter storm, common belief that their God sent it in anger at the sinners within the tribe. As such, those that survived it were revered and loved, as they were looked upon as God's Chosen. The generation of the Chosen People's is on their way out, Svetomir being one of the longest surviving at the age of eighty.\u00a0He was a captain in his youth, fighting in the mountains and the steppes, keeping the other tribes away from what was rightfully the Free Men's. He fought for God, he fought for his Hetman, he fought for his tribe. And he continues to do so, until his last breath. He swore his oath upon the Bible, to God and the Trinity, and to break the promise would be heresy of the highest order.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://uploads0.wikiart.org/images/ilya-repin/the-reply-of-the-zaporozhian-cossacks-to-sultan-mahmoud-iv-1896.jpg!Large.jpg", "https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/009/642/353/large/mateusz-przeklasa-87e48ce7-0c3b-4502-8428-fe1a6fdc5167.jpg?1520106523"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><u><font size=\"6\">Hetamante Vil'ni Lyudy</font><br/></u><br/></div>"}}
