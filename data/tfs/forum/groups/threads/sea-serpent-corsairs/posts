Of course a jolly fight is a pastime that many outlaw sailors enjoy and which can only be encouraged. But save your energy for when the real fight starts and the more or less well trained defenders of small cities and merchants tries to make a vicious fight back. This is when your mettle as a Sea Serpent Corsair is really tested, but with success comes infamy and gold!___________________________________* The hierarchy of the ship of course starts with a captain and the first mate follows. But crew is hired and positions made from need and thus anyone with a particular skill set may potentially find themselves with an important role on the Sea Serpent. The captain, although he is the one with the last word, feels that a pirate is best left a pirate. This means that anyone within the crew can approach him and he will to the best he can to try to accommodate the wishes of his crew. Anyone asking to join will need to speak directly with the captain too, and if not spooked too much, they are usually allowed to join.\u00a0___________________________________\u00a0* The ship is a story in itself. Acting as a vessel for the soul of a long dead ancient sea serpent, the skull on the front is not just for show. And when you think the captain is talking with himself... That might not be the actual case!Current members of the Sea Serpent Corsairs:Captain: Windfeld 'Sea-shrieker'     \u00a0First mate: Annabelle WhistShip: @baleen     [Please PM me or write here if you wish to join.
