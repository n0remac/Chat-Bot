While no one knows the true nature of the forest, many believe it is cursed with dark magic.  Heavy rainstorms are common and dark clouds constantly blot out the sun.  A thick, persistent, and unnatural mist clings to the landscape, restricting visibility.\u00a0One wonders why anyone would ever venture into the Darkwald.  Many would say you have to be brave or stupid, but the truth lies in greed and opportunity.  The forest is like a wedge driven between an arena of competing nation-states, and when they\u2019re not fighting each other trade can be a lucrative venture - although war does present its own opportunities...\u00a0Despite the risk involved, it is quicker and thus far more profitable to cut through the Darkwald than go around it.  As long as you do not stray too far from the main roads you\u2019re likely to survive; otherwise you may meet a fate worse than death.\u00a0The northwestern estuaries of the Vorstuga bind it to the northern oceans, and the river itself cuts through the Darkwald diagonally, spilling into the southern oceans in the southeast.  While large vessels are unable to sail too far inland, the river is wide and deep enough for moderately-sized trade cogs and smaller ships.  Maritime trade up and down the Vorstuga is by far the safest, quickest, and most profitable venture in the Darkwald.\u00a0Blackwater, a league of shady financiers, seeks to take advantage of that.  Thus far they have built warehouses on the banks of the Vorstuga near the crossroads, as well as homes for their dockworkers.  In addition, they have financed the construction of the Hallows Inn, which provides respite for the local laborers and accommodation for travelers.  But like the Darkwald, the true nature of Blackwater is unknown, but they are certainly not the humble traders\u2019 guild they appear to be.  In any case, the town itself has been named Blackwater, after the company which founded it, and the company itself is commonly referred to as \u2018the League\u2019.\u00a0Blackwater belongs to no nation, and is essentially \u2018lawless\u2019, but nothing happens without the League\u2019s knowledge, and one would be wise to remember that.  The dockworkers, their families, and Sloan the innkeep all respect one another, and are strictly loyal to the League.  Nevertheless, a mysterious individual named Grey acts as Blackwater\u2019s sheriff.LocationsBlackwaterCharactersGrey", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/3602/blackwater", "/user/3103"], "image_list": [], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><b><u><font size=\"7\">Blackwater</font></u></b></div>"}}
