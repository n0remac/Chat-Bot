For years they searched, scouring the virgin earth for some new land, any land, to settle in. This search would eventually lead them to their salvation, though definitely not what they expected. Icy plains and mountains stretching for as far as the eye could see. Frigid winds and sudden storms were a common occurrence among the frozen peaks and tundras. Here, deep in the Toragana Mountains, they would raise a nation, one of peace and quiet. Just as they said they would, a nation was born, given the name Airli by its citizens. It was filled with unity, and tranquility. They would construct their cities, in the most frigid and remote areas of the mountains, where only a being with Ovis fur could venture.  Though soon after they had slid into the rhythm of life in the mountains, a new discovery, put a twist in the obscure road ahead.A new civilization, older than any encountered before, introduced themselves to the Airli. They were the Archons, ancient beings, predating the cataclysm. Incredible manifestations of power, they used it only for good, for the purging of the bad. They seemed peaceful, and stayed on good terms with the Airli, introducing them to new ideas, and technology. The Archons taught the Airli to live together in peace and quiet, just as they had wished. The Airli were taught how to share with nature and take only what one needed. But the most precious gift of all from the Archons was their care, as they nurtured the virgin nation with unprecedented love. Though it seems not even Archons could live forever, and all but one perished to what could only be assumed as old age. The Airli grieved, but could not turn back time, only keep it running. So, they pulled through their terrible loss and swore an oath to protect the final Archon with their lives. This Archon in particular was called Hope.The Airli Society:At the heart of the Airli society is sharing and trust. Every citizen works by their will, and nothing more. Everything that one person gains, the Airli gain. This leads to an overall tight knit community, where everyone leans on each other. In their towns, one will find no shops, no governing building, and virtually no military presence. This is not to say they don\u2019t have a large military. Not many would be able to traverse the unmapped, frozen, mountain tips that surround the Airli civilization. But, if one survived the sudden storms, fatal avalanches, and steep cliffs, they would find a unwelcoming community, with closed doors. But to the Airli, traversing these mountains, come as natural, and so they climb, hike, and run through the mountains with almost no rest, moving with a cat like grace. Though the main part of life in the Airli society, lies in the Ovis. Large sheep like animals, that produce virtually everything for the Airli, ranging from clothes and food to candles and weapons. The Airli heard Ovis with a passion, and can be often found, leading herds of Ovis through the mountains in search of rare grass or moss.The Airli Military:The Airli employ a battle technique named the Deluge, it allows them to avoid large scale battles that they will most likely lose. To be more exact, Deluge is a tactical doctrine where the purpose of the combat involved is not to seize control of territory; instead, flexible noncommittal attacks are used to inflict damage on a target and immediately exit the area to avoid the enemy's defense and retaliation. Such raids can also expose enemy defensive weaknesses and achieve a psychological effect on the enemy's morale. The Airli also use the unmapped mountains to their advantage, and will often confuse and mislead enemies through them. If all else fails, they will retreat to their cities, and let the otherwise inhospitable cold do the work for them.Airli Soldier:Native Creatures:Ovis:Ehif:Chimeran:", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.pinimg.com/564x/35/db/e3/35dbe33e118f74ef8358b3a6136b6ee2.jpg", "https://i.pinimg.com/564x/df/e6/61/dfe661b912c165234a73c17c967deffe.jpg", "https://i.pinimg.com/564x/f8/38/52/f838526d243171c0065986a62b49b1dc.jpg", "https://i.pinimg.com/564x/71/06/c1/7106c1ab5bc517e30ba009f60dbb4af5.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><font size=\"7\">The People of Airli</font></div>"}}
