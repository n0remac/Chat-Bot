They traded with others nearby, occasionally raiding coastal villages in their longboats should a winter be especially harsh. They were happy where they were, and would\u2019ve stayed there indefinitely had nothing happened. But as fate would have it, a massive disaster struck. Later known as the cataclysm, the disaster and what it entailed drove them north and away from their devastated homes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They sailed north into the icy seas to escape the disaster, hoping to find some refuge elsewhere. However the seas had other plans, smashing several ships against the glaciers that plagued the northern sea and beaching the surviving ships. Thus they arrived in the land that would become their home.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having escaped the disaster the people of \u00cdskaldur and constructed a shelter over the cove, utilizing materials from the shipwrecks and a portion of their longboats. They ate leftovers from their journey and food from the sea. Eventually they settled into a routine, one unexpectedly shattered by the arrival of a peaceable group of Mineraali. These creatures of crystal and stone arrived one day from deeper within the barren land, drawn by the signs of civilization. After a short one sided skirmish the vikings had successfully captured the group of Mineraali, whom didn\u2019t have much intention to fight back in the first place. Not long after and the vikings had learned of the existence of a large magic crystal within a grand cavern at the northern pole, described by their prisoners as \u201cthe giver of life\u201d and \u201ccapable of anything imaginable.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At this point the supplies from the original journey had begun to wear thin and many were interested in what this crystal could provide. A group containing the competent warriors was formed and sent on a journey to claim this crystal. They journey across the frozen land was difficult, plagued by many of the beasts that reside in this land. Upon arriving to their destination they were ragged and tired, not fit to fight the vast amount of Mineraali who were present. The Mineraali recognized the suffering of the warriors, but they were divided about whether they should help them reach their goal or not. Many viewed the humans as unworthy to behold the crystal, while others saw the crystal as a power that must be shared. Much heated deliberation occurred over this, and when the human warriors burst in and attempted to force their way to the crystal the scene erupted. Crystalline titans clashed, and through the chaos the warriors made their way. Lives were lost, but they had reached their destination.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With the brawl continuing outside, the humans approached the massive crystal embedded within the earth. It glowed with an eerie, unfamiliar magic, the power of which reverberated through the bones. Upon drawing near the crystal\u2019s glow become blinding and it let loose a wave of magic that swept across the icy land, changing its inhabitants. Subsequently the fighting outside the cavern was brought to an end, and the Mineraali filtered in. From the ground near the crystal a being emerged, humanoid in appearance but made of metal wires and plates. Thus the first Valkyrie was formed, which was taken as a sign that this was what was meant to be.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A majority of the vikings moved from the port settlement, now named Hafnarh\u00f6fn, to the budding city of \u00cdskaldur. Walls and housing were constructed through the mutual efforts of the Mineraali and vikings. The Valkyries, though still few in number, oversaw many things and assisted where needed. The power of the crystal had changed many things, granting the humans immortality and allowing the Mineraali to speak the common language. The warriors who initially encountered the crystal became Berserkers, with several others following in their footsteps. And so we reach the point in which history ends and the future begins.Inhabitants of \u00cdskaldurSPOILER: Click to show\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The inhabitants of \u00cdskaldur are a varied bunch, ranging from the mostly average human viking to the crystalline Mineraali to the angel-esque Valkyrie.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The humans of \u00cdskaldur fill a majority of its population. They possess a immortality that allows them to recover from a great many non lethal wounds, and while on \u00cdskaldurian land are unable to be killed. While granted immortality by the crystal, it did not come without drawbacks. The most immediate was the loss of fertility in its population. The second was the ability to recall information better, which eventually led to a form of insanity which has been theorized to result from the soul being unable to effectively store all its memories. As such it\u2019s become normal to use magic to wipe the extraneous memories of those afflicted. It usually has no severe side effects, with those treated still able to remember core details such as who they were and what skills they possess, but they tend to be be unable to remember parts of their old life. This affliction progresses at different for every individual.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Vikings: The most numerous of the inhabitants of \u00cdskaldur, they fill many of the more specialized or skillful jobs within \u00cdskaldur. Blacksmithing, fishing, magic casting, and so forth.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Berserkers: Former vikings transformed by the power of the crystal, these people tend to be much more physically capable than their viking counterparts. Their skin becomes much more resilient and it\u2019s said in tales that it has the ability to repel blade and fire. They tend to fill the roles of elite forces in the military. The number of Berserkers is quite limited however, as the process of becoming one requires passing a series of difficult trials meant to test the individual.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mineraali: Brought to life by the crystal, they worship it and treat it as a holy deity and the cave where it\u2019s located as a holy location. They were the original inhabitants of \u00cdskaldur. They average about 7 and a half feet tall. They can be made of any naturally occurring mineral, including crystals, stones, and metals. They\u2019re \u2018soul,\u201d while focused in their center, is diffused through their entire bodies. Hence a major wound can often leave a Mineraali an entirely different being. They are the least combative of the four groups, and often help with tasks requiring extensive physical ability, and the crystalline Mineraali can refract and focus light.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Valkyrie: The Valkyrie are humanoid beings, something like modified Homunculi. Beings formed by the crystal, they are in effect humanoid masses of living metal wire, enmeshed within a suit of armor they use as a body. They are essentially an imperfect imitation of humanity. They tend to possess human personalities, but one aspect is usually over-emphasized, such as anger, cheerfulness, dedication, et cetera. They also typically possess some degree of magic ability.CultureSPOILER: Click to show\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00cdskaldur is an isolated nation and as such has been relatively static in terms of cultural and technological development. Much of what they have now, bar a few obvious things, is much the same as it was in the past. The Crystal is a major part of the society\u2019s religion, either seen as the holy deity in the view of the Mineraali and Valkyrie, or as a gift from their god in the view of the human populace. Either way it\u2019s highly revered and carefully looked after by all inhabitants, and disgracing it often results in the worst of punishments.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Slavery of \u00cdskaldurians, while not outlawed, is widely viewed as poor practice as the thought of unending servitude eventually upset the people of \u00cdskaldur. However criminals are often forced to work as indentured servants for a variable amount of time and the enslaving of foreigners is still a common practice that isn't viewed as quite as terrible.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00cdskaldurians are mildly suspicious of foreigners, although not unwilling to participate in trade and interact with them. They tend to be direct in their intentions, typically seeing no point in beating around the bush.GovernmentSPOILER: Click to show\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00cdskaldur is an absolute monarchy, ruled by a Chief of All, currently Thrand Rangvaldrson. He has a council of advisors, one from each of the different groups of beings. Traditionally these positions were won through a duel between two native \u00cdskaldurians with the victor electing himself or a sponsor to the position he won, but over time the people became content with those in charge and challenges became exceedingly rare.EconomySPOILER: Click to show\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00cdskaldur runs off a barter system primarily, as most of its currency is the pillage from ages ago and has a wide variety of different standards. That\u2019s not to say exchanges with currency don\u2019t happen, and it\u2019s common to see them when one side has no valuable service to offer. When they do happen they tend to weigh the gold and use that as a standard rather than the currency itself.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Their main form of interaction with the outside is through trade. They import most anything new and unique, including slaves and a fair amount of things other nations would consider less than legal. As such they are considered a safe haven by the pirates and smugglers of the world, although it\u2019s understood that the haven only exists as long as they stay within \u00cdskaldur\u2019s good graces.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Due to trade being such a major part of \u00cdskaldur\u2019s interactions with the outside world, they have specialized in a few goods, the most noticeable and influential of which are listed below.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Burnihneta: A strange nut that grows only in the areas around the city of \u00cdskaldur. It\u2019s a dull red in color, about an inch in diameter, and stays good for anywhere between a couple months and a year. Possesses the strange quality of producing heat, and is widely used throughout \u00cdskaldur to keep warm. When it leaves \u00cdskaldur and the influence of the crystal, it becomes chilled and can be used to help preserve food.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Borine pelt: A thick furry pelt that belongs to the Borine, a type of canine that resides in \u00cdskaldur and is used as sled dogs before being killed for their pelt. The pelt usually comes in either black or white, depending on if the Borine was killed during the day or night segment of the year, and is known for the comfortable warmth it provides. Occasionally a pelt that is both black and white can be found if a Borine was killed during the shift between day and night.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lighstones: A mineral found within the mines of Eldav\u00e9l. After being kept in light for extended periods of time it\u2019ll glow when put into areas with less light. However the time for which it stays illuminated in the dark is often less than the time it was kept in the light. It\u2019s recommended to keep it away from torches for when heated it becomes quite volatile, although this does make it a useful explosive as well. It depends on what you\u2019re looking for.Making Contact with \u00cdskaldurThe easiest of the \u00cdskaldur's cities to reach would be Hafnarh\u00f6fn, and it can relay messages or escort groups to the capital city.Link to the location thread", "link_list": ["javascript:void(0);", "javascript:void(0);", "javascript:void(0);", "javascript:void(0);", "javascript:void(0);", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/3389/skaldur-hafnarh-fn-city"], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/RCXQRYU.jpg"], "html": "<div align=\"center\">\u00cdskaldur's Banner</div>"}}
