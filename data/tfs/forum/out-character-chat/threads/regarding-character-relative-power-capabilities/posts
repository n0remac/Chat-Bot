The short version is that he can use manipulation of electrical forces to affect electromagnetic fields, either as locational energy fields that act on magnetic metals as one would expect, as a personal field to act as a means of deflection, or even to short circuit the nervous systems of living creatures to affect temporary paralysis. In addition, he has a custom designed gauntlet intended to be used as a means to support the Lorentz force application of electromagnetism to create a railgun-like effect using assorted bits of small ferrous metal to enable extremely powerful but ultimately short ranged physical projectile attacks.Would these concepts be too 'modern science' to be acceptable? Granted, the railgauntlet may be understandably over the line, but this is a pre-existing character concept of mine being brought into a setting that may not be wholly compatible. I could amend his abilities to be more standard electrical mixed with more conventional magic effects if necessary.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "I was curious about some features of the power set of my intended character.

It's fine to have very powerful magic effects. People do that all the time. Dragons fly around, and that's fine.\u00a0However, it's unacceptable to have, say, a flintlock pistol- or any other sort of \"gun\" for that matter. Even though a flintlock pistol is considerably less powerful than a dragon's breath attack. It's a theming thing. So, in using and describing powers and abilities, you should avoid words like \"electromagnetic fields,\" \"Lorentz force,\" \"Railgun,\" and other such modern terms.\u00a0Even if those words would be best used to convey your point, using the words breaks the 'immersion', if you will. Breaks the fantasy feel- which is the primary concern.\u00a0So, if you'd like to, you could proooobably dress it up with magic and fantasy words, and use the things you're referring to. Just be careful to make it seem more like a sort of advanced magic, and not just a railgun strapped to your gauntlet. Additionally, you should be prepared to have your powers be blocked by other people's magic.\u00a0For additional information that may not be quite applicable, refer to the last question of this post.\u00a0", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1367/frequently-asked"], "image_list": [], "html": "Here's my opinion, in a non-official capacity.
