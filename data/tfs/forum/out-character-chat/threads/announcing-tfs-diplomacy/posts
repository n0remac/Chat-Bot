Diplomacy is a game wherein there are seven players, each of which assumes a country in Europe during the years leading into World War I. It\u2019s a fascinating game to me because you\u2019ll not triumph solely with superior strategy or upon any roll of dice. No, to get ahead in Diplomacy, you need to do honest to goodness diplomacy with other players. You must anticipate who is working with who, who will move what in the next round to where, and if you can trust your ally to proceed with the plan because they very well could stab you in the metaphorical back.I\u2019ve been involved in two games so far, once as a player and once as an arbitrator. Both games were a lot of fun; it\u2019s a unique game. So, I\u2019m going to go ahead and host one here on TFS. \u201cCommunity Bonding,\u201d I might say, but I may be lying because Diplomacy is a game where someone will be betrayed. That would be one player betraying the trust of another within the context of the game. As such, to avoid drama, please only ask to join if you are prepared and willing to accept that maturely.I will be using the website backstabbr to handle the game. Doing it manually- resolving the moves correctly, is a pain to do so I\u2019m not going to do it. The game\u2019s participants will make an account on the site, join the game, and submit their moves within the limited timeframe they have to do so. This period may be a week or may be less, but it\u2019s not going to be more than a week. As such, please only ask to join the game if you can reliably make moves as often as that. Further, the game may potentially stretch over the course of months depending on how quickly everyone can submit moves, so be aware of what you're signing on for.Further, for the game\u2019s participants, it may be worth designating someone else who may make moves in your absence. If no moves are submitted, all armies hold, and that\u2019s not ideal.In any case, if you have any questions or would like to take part, post on this thread. No one who hasn\u2019t posted in this thread will be on the list, regardless if you PM me or not. Once things are started a bit, I\u2019ll keep a list here of who has signed up. When it comes time to play, I will use a random selection tool to pull seven names.", "link_list": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy_(game)", "http://www.backstabbr.com/"], "image_list": [], "html": "Hello and welcome, to this post in which I am announcing I will be hosting a game of "}, "post-71627": {"user": "Miroell", "user_num": 2444, "timestamp": "1502929491000", "message": "", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://sequinsandshimmer.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/keep-calm-and-i-volunteer-as-tribute-8.png"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://sequinsandshimmer.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/keep-calm-and-i-volunteer-as-tribute-8.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}, "post-71630": {"user": "Arya Shieldheart", "user_num": 997, "timestamp": "1502932731000", "message": "This sounds like fun I'll play.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "This sounds like fun I'll play."}, "post-71677": {"user": "Corpus", "user_num": 2420, "timestamp": "1503032937000", "message": "I'm in", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "I'm in"}, "post-72981": {"user": "Asthor \"Sneak\"", "user_num": 1798, "timestamp": "1505344422000", "message": "Is this still open to people to join ", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Is this still open to people to join "}, "post-72984": {"user": "Warlord Shintaro Nishida", "user_num": 565, "timestamp": "1505348817000", "message": "Sept 13, 2017 15:13:42 GMT -8 Asthor \"Sneak\" said:Is this still open to people to join I believe it is still", "link_list": ["/post/72981/thread", "/user/1798"], "image_list": ["https://i.pinimg.com/736x/5c/62/bc/5c62bc251aa24a360e699d715b0e0e77--character-portraits-character-illustration.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@hordedguildmaster\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/72981/thread\" timestamp=\"1505344422\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-1798\" title='Asthor \"Sneak\"'><img alt='Asthor \"Sneak\" Avatar' src=\"https://i.pinimg.com/736x/5c/62/bc/5c62bc251aa24a360e699d715b0e0e77--character-portraits-character-illustration.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/72981/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1505344422000\" title=\"Sept 13, 2017 15:13:42 GMT -8\">Sept 13, 2017 15:13:42 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-1798 group-0\" href=\"/user/1798\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@hordedguildmaster\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Asthor \"Sneak\"</span></a></span> said:</div>Is this still open to people to join <div class=\"quote_clear\"></div></div></div>"}, "post-73028": {"user": "Asthor \"Sneak\"", "user_num": 1798, "timestamp": "1505423671000", "message": "If it is I will join", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "If it is I will join"}}
