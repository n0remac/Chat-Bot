I have a rough idea, but if she doesn't fit the setting then it's a dead end.Apologies for the late response - place has been quiet all morning.Now, would vampires be the main denizen of this nation? And the other undeads are sort of minorities and/or raised simply for work/war/fighting/use purposes? Obviously humans would play a very \"low\" part - I would like to see them either have the money to ensure their usefulness, or actually be literal cattle otherwise with no freedom and a very clear and grim purpose. But that's your call, of course. I would like to see the hierarchy be decided mainly by race and secondly by money - I think that would make for interesting encounters and line up. Plus, it's a clear placement for those rebellion groups to start forming.Also, what kind of physical features for the land are we talking about? How large would the nation be? How many regions within this nation would be available to be owned/controlled by the counts and countesses?BTW, this sounds like a nice medieval twist on Underworld's vampire aristocracy.

Each Vampire would have his own \"ingenius\" idea on how to use his minions and would enforce their individual laws.
