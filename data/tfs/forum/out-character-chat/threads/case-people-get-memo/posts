The section of Tokhung is still under construction at the moment so it's not available as of yet but that should change within the coming week or so.Anyone can try to come and visit. If you wish to make from within the nation, all you have to do is ask - I'm willing to work with people. Provided an idea isn't completely off the wall and outrageous, chances are it will work.Tawakoshi is the hopes of having something more than just a nation with a theme and setting for people to be in. Responses to certain aspects are IC (such as an intolerance for magic, not wanting certain individuals, being biased, corruption) rather than an OOC front to try and prevent or adjust situations. Also, there will be events. There will be actions. There will be lore and stories unfolding aside from the personal ones of each OC that appears within the sandbox. Tawakoshi is a hope to have a nation that is alive.That said, please glance at the government page - there are notes on groups and families, lore and rumors and etiquettes and laws. The Tawakoshi Notice Board is IC knowledge for anyone within the nation and easy to pick up if you're an immigrant - if certain information isn't public knowledge, it will be noted elsewhere and mentioned as such. Also, time is a concept in Tawakoshi - note the update in the Notice Board that winter is upon the land. Things will be moving. Things will happen. I would be honored if you came to join the story of this province.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Tawakoshi is mostly open.
