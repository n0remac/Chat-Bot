If not she's a witch .\u00a0But what makes her strong is her coven and the people she claims and gives powerstones. I just want to get an idea if anyone would like to do that. I won't go to in-depth\u00a0right now and it doesn't mean they have to be joined at the hip all the time but it allows them to do a couple of quests together or with others and have a 'working' relationship.\u00a0She hasn't claimed anyone (which is the reason she ran away before her claiming ceremony) but in a life-threatening situation, she'd do it to save a life! If you'd like more info Pm me or just reply to the thread at what you'd like to know!Eli, your ever kind witch.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["//storage.proboards.com/6046952/images/ZTHUqMK9yNs4LbK2c7ki.png"], "html": "Hey!"}}
