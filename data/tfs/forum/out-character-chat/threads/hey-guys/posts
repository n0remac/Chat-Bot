I had a family emergency that halted all of my rp.Second of all, it would be a huge help if those of you who have been here for awhile, engaged in rp with those who are just arriving in some way just to keep things moving. It's not required but encouraged to create second and third characters in order to help with the flow of getting rp as well as giving rp. Please don't be afraid to make new characters.We want to make sure everyone gets helped and sometimes there are those of us who are bogged down with helping in every way we can, and we cannot always get to the new players. If you happen to see that someone is not being replied to, please go ahead and play with them if you could. It would greatly help!", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "First of all, sorry for my abrupt disappearance. I had a family emergency that halted all of my rp."}}
