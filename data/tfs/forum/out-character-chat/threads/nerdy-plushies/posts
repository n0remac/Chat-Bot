So at the moment I have no licenses since it is nothing professional yet. I feel like I need to grow first before working on making an official brand. I can make about 2-3 small ones a day but the big ones take a longer time to make. Like 1-2 days. So it is definetly not a mass production project. They are made with crocheting so it is round after round of stitches :P Not as fast as just getting a bit of fabric and putting a scissor to it. And after all I do stand for the quality of them and I will redo if I am not satisfied with how they turned out.

I am planning to try and strike a deal with a gaming shop close to me to see if they want to sell the plushies in exchange for part of the profit.
