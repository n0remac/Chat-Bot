The one in charge of Sarisu island has yet to touch it due to IRL things. And the one over Quying seems to have less time for the realm.If there's something that you, the players, would like to see happen to maybe pique your interest in the place - please say so. With the loss of half the working crew to keep the place buzzing despite there being no damn buzz, I'm finding it very difficult to want to continue watching over a virtually empty nation.If I cannot provide enough to gain interest, then I will have no choice but to shelf the whole project. I rather not do that - I worked on this nation for months. If need be, I can shelf the missing pieces left by the people I entrusted. But it can't happen if no one wants to join. So if it's intimidating, uninteresting, offensive, whatever - just some honest feedback would be really damn helpful.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Alright, enough with pleasantries and professional speaking.

I would first suggest that you create one or two small quests in Tawakoshi. A bounty on bandits, a marauding beast of some sort, or perhaps something less combat-centric. Have the that, put it up in the quests board, and leave it there. Because one potential thing that may be a stumbling block for Tawakoshi is a lack of obvious things to do in Tawakoshi. If one goes and looks at the nation,  yes, there is is, but what\u2019s one to do? Visit just for fun? No. Providing a reason for a character to come is a good idea. Even if no one comes to accept the quest immediately, it will be there. After that, I would suggest looking at the physical structure of your nation, and reconsidering how you might like it to be laid out. Bearing in mind what you mentioned about the players you thought would be helping you not doing that, it may be in your best interests to trim some parts of Tawakoshi out that you wouldn\u2019t like to administrate yourself. The \u201csmaller\u201d your space is, the more concentrated your activity is going to be, and were I in your position, I wouldn\u2019t want to tend to some city I didn\u2019t create. Making a post on the Requests of Staff page, individual threads or whole sub boards can be archived. If whoever comes back, the relevant bits can be archived with minimal hassle. As context to introduce my next suggestion, lots of players will often look at either the Recent page or the Overworld page to see what\u2019s going on, and consider where they might like to play. Nations like LTS, where the last post was mine, three days ago (and there aren\u2019t any other even plausibly active scenes in the region), do not stand out as active, and thus, are not at all appealing to new characters looking to start out on the sandbox, or existing characters looking for something new to do. The nations that stand out are the ones with green text, the ones with posts on them today. Preferably, several posts, updating a few times over the course of a day. So, with this in mind, I think that it would be a good idea to use some of your own characters to begin scenes in Tawakoshi, for people to read, and so that the nation seems alive. Give it a pulse. Perhaps there\u2019s some sort of holiday, so the daimyos are invited to the capital and there\u2019s a feast. I don\u2019t quite know what sorts of characters you have in Tawakoshi, or what sorts of things might be appropriate for them to do, but playing in your own setting, with whoever\u2019s there, is important, in my opinion. Not only so that the place looks active from a meta perspective, but so the place feels good for characters to be in. Going back and forth with a nation account is only so fulfilling, and if the others aren\u2019t going to be doing it, you\u2019ll need to give Tawakoshi personality yourself.Another thing you could consider is international play. Though your nation is in fact literally an island, it can interact with other existing nations on TFS, and you may be able create activity that way. Perhaps by sending a few ships full of some exclusive export of yours to a foreign harbor, to negotiate an exchange of goods. Something like that would bring Tawakoshi to the attention of whoever happens to be around to notice the ships, and then, depending on what the export is, the nation could then turn around and sell it in their marketplace, which would be sort of like advertising. Characters could use the product, and mention it in their posts, and such.What I\u2019m getting at here is that I feel like you would be well suited by taking the in-character initiative, and personally trying to start things. Players are not simply going to look at Tawakoshi, read some of its threads, and decide to send a character there because they like the threads. That doesn\u2019t happen. Make Tawakoshi relevant in the grander scheme of the Overworld. Give characters a reason to be aware of Tawakoshi, and a reason to go there. Once they\u2019re there, play with them, give them something to do, try to hook them up with characters that are already there, and try to get them started on stories and such, so you don\u2019t have to keep babysitting them yourself. Start the activity snowball yourself, and do your best to get it rolling. It\u2019s not going to be easy, but it\u2019s also not going to start itself rolling simply by you watching over it and willing it to start moving.Of course, these are only my suggestions. I don\u2019t really have much feedback on the nation itself, as I haven\u2019t looked at it very closely, only feedback on your methods. But I also don\u2019t think that the structure of the nation itself is terribly important in the grander scheme of things. When I looked at Tawakoshi shortly after it was first posted, it seemed quite fine. All I would suggest doing now in terms of the setting itself is trimming off the parts you wouldn\u2019t like to maintain, because they\u2019re dead weight. Empty sub boards with no posts in them make a nation seem empty, and that\u2019s not a look you want to go for. Only keep what you think is important, and then try to fill that with things for characters to do. Follow Up Bonus: Ambient QuestsWhen a character enters a particular area, or does a particular thing, something happens. For example, perhaps a well is haunted, and screams when a character walks past. The well doesn\u2019t have a big glowly quest marker above it and a bounty posted for it, but if the character is the reasonably competent sort, they might stop, think to themselves, \u201cHmm. What was that?\u201d and investigate. From there, one could develop things in whatever manner, and lead the character on a quest, even though the quest is not officially designated as such. Doing things in this manner, one does not necessarily need to involve sentient beings in a quest, or use rumors, or any of that. Having these sorts of things, even if they\u2019re only small things, such as perhaps, finding a map that leads to another location, where something is buried - that\u2019s still quite interesting, and would provide incentive for characters to explore. It\u2019s an alternative option, aside from signs posted in taverns and giant monster attacks. In considering this idea further, perhaps you\u2019ll think of something more clever than I, I'm not very much good at creating quests.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "I think that you may be well suited by adjusting your approach.

There's plenty of resources out there for me to learn about, but I sadly have neither the drive nor the time to dedicate to figuring it out.

(kind of?)At the moment, I am SUPER jacked about merfolk/sea creature types. I really enjoy making and playing them, and they make me happy. If we're going to get me/people like me\u00a0to Tawakoshi, we have to find a way to meld your presumed passion for Eastern Asian culture with my passion for sea creatures and gnomes (or whatever the person's particular flavor is; pirates, bandits, mages with two heads, whatever).How this happens is what we need to work on.
