{"post-26234": {"user": "Jun of the Celadine", "user_num": 108, "timestamp": "1456728928000", "message": "Ok, so I'm going to try this again.There has been a lot of misinformation, confusion, and anger between Goraia and different players. To me it seems like a chaotic nonsensical mess with guilt on both sides. People are angry in general, angry over rumors, and angry over each other's anger. And, of course, people are using Goraia as an excuse to promote their own regime changes and badmouth the administrator.Well, I'm tired of it. What I want, and what I think most of us want, is for everyone to get along. This is a game, and like most games, it's meant to be fun, not a source of stress. Surely there is a way we can come to an understanding on this.In writing this, I only have one goal, to try to make peace between everyone.First let me play devil's advocate and say the following:Goraia has been around for a very long time, and their players know the Sandbox. They are not outside trolls looking to destroy the Sandbox. They are part of the people that built the Sandbox. Rather than ostracize them or use underhanded tactics against them, we really should be talking to them. But we should be talking to them from a place of understanding and acceptance, and not fear.We need to understand Goraia's perspective. The Fantasy Sandbox is designed to support any type of play and is only limited by the community. There is pacifist and violent play, there is a combat system, but not one that has to be used. And Goraia, whose players have as much a right to be here as anyone else, are a part of that culture. There is an RP culture that accepts death and consequences as a part of the game. There are also players here who have explicitly expressed disdain for that sort of culture.Basically the Sandbox is a mixed aquarium of very different kinds of fish. And I believe that among RPers there is an inherent disagreement and historical legacy of distaste between these certain types of fish.As the Octopus in the group (interpret that as you will), I'd just like to say, I don't have any ill will towards Goraia. I have made it public knowledge that I intend to fight Goraia for the sheer enjoyment of it, not because I hate them. In fact, I am convinced that this is what Goraia wants.\u00a0The Sandbox was designed to have governments and groups with NPC counts and inter-government/group battles. I believe that Goraia, being one of the older players on the Sandbox, signed up for this. They expected this. And they expect people to try to conquer their little super-weapon.And, and I need you all to pay attention here, I am in total agreement with their weapon being unassailable by a single opponent. I believe, and I think Goraia will agree, that the assailing of their kingdom was meant to be a team effort. And it has to be done using the inter-government combat system.The administrator has even made it known in chat that Goraia can benefit the sandbox by bringing in more RP. There has been a flurry of activity all around the Sandbox since they showed up, and I don't think this is a bad thing.Now, I also believe that Goraia has made some mistakes. They could have communicated their intention to reform Medan into something less likely to get treated as dragon fodder. They could have established that they planned on defending their borders with a super-weapon. They could have publicly requested Lamina's consent to RP some... rather unsavory scenes. Rather than let the Octopus figure it out, they could have made their intentions known so that anyone who wants to participate, could.The fatal flaw that combat RPers tend have is they don't want to communicate. Communication is seen as meta-gaming and takes away from the element of surprise. But TFS is a world that accepts all types, including those who only want to engage in consensual RP, story-based RP, etc. For this world to exist, communication has to be the number one rule of the Sandbox.But at the same time, more passive, consensual RPers must be willing to put aside their personal feelings and accept that this style of RP has a right to exist too. Let's be real. Many pacifist RPers have had negative experiences with combat RPers. Back in high school (which some of you are still in) you might have been bullied by someone who wanted to wreck your story line. It's no different than hating that kid down the block for kicking down your sand castle when you were four.Here it's more like this. You have kids who play a game where they intentionally try to assail each other's sand castles. You're a builder only. They don't know that. They invite you to come play, and you start to build your sand castle...Or, on the flip side. Your friends like to wreck each other's sand castles. Your invited by some other friends to play with them. You're having fun, but then you realize that your friends are gazing upon you in horror as you wreck their sand castles. All you can ask is, why aren't you trying to wreck mine?Don't you get it? You're all just a bunch of kids with different ideas on how to play with sand castles.And I've got news for you, overall, you're not a large group. Most people prefer to play video games or go drink with friends or make fantasy football teams or gamble or... well, whatever. I'm not implying that we're any stranger than anyone else.But we all have a unique hobby in common. Some people are birds, some are lizards, we're fish.So, I therefore invite Goraia to establish a line of communication with the rest of the sandbox, and I encourage the rest of the sandbox to listen and keep an open mind. Things have to change if this project is going to continue to survive and thrive.Please, stop fight, and learn to understand each other.You want to know my ultimate solution to Hasdrubal's paradox? Everyone take the time to get to know each other and decide who they want to RP with, based on their preferences.Sincerely,You're friendly neighborhood Octopus.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Ok, so I'm going to try this again."}, "post-26267": {"user": "Royal Fletcher", "user_num": 323, "timestamp": "1456734439000", "message": "Thanks for that, Jun. it seems that everyone just wants to argue all the time.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Thanks for that, Jun. it seems that everyone just wants to argue all the time."}, "post-26271": {"user": "Moonflower L\u00e0idir", "user_num": 1010, "timestamp": "1456736622000", "message": "I'm all for not arguing.
