{"post-20916": {"user": "Empress Naoki", "user_num": 607, "timestamp": "1452475227000", "message": "Staff members and fellow players, I approach you today on the behalf of a group of like minded individuals, because it is our opinion that some changes need to be made regarding the way this site is run. It has to do with the currently existing conflict between combat in this roleplay environment, and the, well, sandbox nature of the environment.As it stands right now, things are sort of in an uncomfortable spot. There are those among us, such as myself, who want to come to this site and create interesting stories and such in the sandbox area with other characters, and who don\u2019t give a flying feather about combat, save for how it affects the characters. And then there are those who aren\u2019t me, who enjoy fighting, for its own sake. And that\u2019s fine, I don\u2019t mean to imply anyone is incorrect in their preferences or any of that. But the issue crops up when someone like my character, some perfectly standard person, without any relatively substantial combat capability, walks somewhere outside of the walls, away from a platoon of bodyguards. And then some some merciless mercenary, or some angsty assassin with a chip on his shoulder comes along, and whack, I\u2019m dead. All of the stories I\u2019ve done with this character, all the depth, interactions, emotions, of that, gone. And yes, ones such as myself, who have chosen to make characters that can\u2019t really defend themselves, shouldn\u2019t really send those characters walking in the woods alone. I also understand that. But this massive disparity isn\u2019t only present between characters that cannot fight and those that can, it\u2019s also present between characters that can fight, and characters that have godly powers. With the current atmosphere, the current ruleset, the way that things are understood is such that any character that can fight, can just sort of crop up in my backyard or city or what have you, and if the amount of power that their player has assigned to them is higher than the amount of power I\u2019ve assigned my character, they can stab me. Without my permission or consent as a player, without any sort of system that enforces fair combat, and without any reason that adds to anybody\u2019s story but their own. And that\u2019s not really a healthy way for things to exist, in our opinion. There are systems that exist that allow for fair combat to take place within them. Like any table-top game ever - D&D, for example. In D&D, your character has a set amount of power, that you can freely distribute, and choose how you\u2019d like them to be powerful. Important events are decided by dice rolls, which are, by their very nature, fair. You could conceivably do player versus player combat within a D&D ruleset, and it would be fair. Here, by the very nature of the sandbox environment, there aren\u2019t any such systems in place. There are rules that attempt to prevent extreme abuse cases, yes, but none that attempt to create combat scenarios that are inherently fair between the two parties. This is, as it is aptly named, a sandbox. In a sandbox, anyone can come over and knock over your castle. And that\u2019s exactly the sort of thing that isn\u2019t really very fun for the person who built the castle. One might say \u201cWell, why don\u2019t you just stop them from knocking over your castle?\u201d Because there isn\u2019t any skill involved in RP combat. I realize that this might be a controversial statement, but without any systems in place, at all, without any enforced style guide, ruleset, dice rolling, or any of that, there\u2019s zero skill involved in dodging attacks, weaseling your way out of situations, shooting massive magical attacks, or any of that. All anyone needs to do is type that the character does those things. One can exercise writing skill, in making the post well written and enjoyable to read, but in the combat itself, there\u2019s not any skill. It\u2019s a text based roleplay, for goodness\u2019 sake. For this reason, because TFS rests at this midpoint, between formalized combat and story focus, we think that a shove is required, one way or the other, to either be a combat-focused thing, or a story-focused thing. The combat isn\u2019t going away either way; conflict between characters is an integral part of a good story, and violence is one tried-and-true form of conflict. But right now, it\u2019s in such a spot that it\u2019s becoming detrimental to the story experience of all, and we feel that the decision should be made to design a more fair combat system, or more firmly cement combat in the role of a tool for advancing story. I will now offer some possible solutions to this issue, any one of which would solve the problem in one way or another. Keep in mind, these are possible solutions, not advocating for any of them. One quick and dirty way to make combat fair-ish would be to implement Roll to Dodge. Declare an action, roll a six sided die. An impartial GM decides how well your character executes the action, based on the result of your roll. This would mean that all combat would require an impartial judge, yes, but I don\u2019t really see that as a massive problem. This would be the quickest and dirtiest way to make combat somewhat fair. One could also implement a more wide reaching, expansive system, perhaps akin to some sort of tabletop, but I don\u2019t think that anyone thinks that would be the correct solution. The obvious downside to this solution is the hit that the sandbox aspect takes. To go the other way, and focus more on story, you could do things in a couple of different ways.The first of those I\u2019ll touch on would be to categorize characters into sorts of strata. Power brackets, if you will. Put them into power boxes based on how well they can fight. Normal humans, humans+, monsters, minor gods, major gods, or some categorization system like that. The categorizations are of course highly configurable. Then, once all the characters are in a power bracket, say this: \u201cYou can only pick fights with people at, or above your bracket.\u201dThis system is kind of weird, in that it only really accounts for 1v1 combat. Can a minor god pick a fight with a group of five monster characters? Good question. There would also be a lot of disagreement about what power level a certain character is in, and who\u2019s allowed to fight who based on this system. This solution would be very much a system, and as such, prone to such things as poor design. That brings us to another, simpler idea. Say this: \u201cYou can only pick fights that you could conceivably lose\u201dOne could call this possible solution \u2018Inherent risk\u2019. Idea being that by only being able to start fights that could go either way, you\u2019re sort of limiting one\u2019s ability to pick on characters that have no chance of beating them. With all of these one lined suggestions, there are a lot of things that would have to be defined to make it a workable rule. For Inherent Risk, the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance would be the question \u201cWhat constitutes a conceivable loss?\u201d Should this question, and any others that may arise, be answered to the satisfaction of all involved, this could work to address the issue.Another possible solution to the problem would be to say something like this:\"Any aggressive action against another character requires consent from that character's player.\"\u2018Required consent\u2019 would ensure simply that both sides are agreeable to the fight. This solution is also not without its flaws. You would have to define what an \u2018aggressive action\u2019 is, and expand with secondary clauses to prevent characters provoking others, and taking action to the detriment of another character, but that aren\u2019t necessarily \u2018aggressive\u2019. It\u2019s sort of a more concrete and binding rule than any of the preceding terms, with the tradeoff that one would have to define a lot of things to make it a legitimate rule that can be read and acted upon without the intervention of a staff member, and contains no loopholes. Another possible solution would be to designate characters as either combatants or noncombatants. All combatants are free to pick fights with other combatants, but noncombatants cannot fight anyone, or be fought. This would prevent characters like my own from being killed, but it wouldn\u2019t do anything to prevent characters of wildly differing power levels from fighting against the will of the weaker character. It could be a \u2018you must specify on your character page\u2019 sort of thing, or an opt-out of combat sort of thing. One might notice a bit of trend, with these suggestions. They\u2019re all geared to completely shut down power gaming at the expense of another\u2019s enjoyment. That\u2019s the point, that\u2019s the goal, that\u2019s why we\u2019re working together to do this. Any of these proposed solutions would do that pretty well. However, there are a lot of ways to do it, and we\u2019re not picky. If anyone can think of a more elegant, more effective, or just plain better solution that accomplishes that same goal, it would probably be fine with most. I\u2019d also like to point out that we are not against the idea of powerful characters, large-scale fights, or cinematic duels, but that we desire a change that will confine those activities to those who want to participate in them, or, failing that, to give a fighting chance to those who do not want to participate but are made to against their will.As I said in the beginning of this thread, I speak for a group. The following list of players agree that the current system is not ideal, and that a change ought to be made to prevent power gaming at the expense of the enjoyment of others. It should be noted that all of these listed primary characters are distinct and active players. Not all of these players are alright with all of the possible solutions presented above (no one is in favor of Roll to Dodge), or even any of them, but everyone is in agreement with the concept of this thread, that power gaming at the expense of the enjoyment of others needs to be stopped.Empress Naoki Artemis Grandma Jun of the Celadine @hasdrubal  Reese Cresno Skarlet Kate Green Artaxerxes Davous the Black Cyronin the Blue Tick Maelik The Fellblade To reiterate, not all of the listed players necessarily agree with any or all of the solutions proposed above. They merely agree with the principle of this thread, and that some change ought to be made. I would like to encourage everyone, name on the list or not, to engage in civil discussion about this topic. Do you agree with the principle? Do you think a change needs to be made? Are you in favor of any of the solutions proposed above, or do you have your own? Please, post, make your opinion heard. It is through the polite sharing of opinions and civil discussion that we hope to spur positive change.

A reasonable power cap should be relatively high, to keep that freedom intact, but not so we have characters that can kill others with, say, one hit.\u00a0Require OoC agreements to kill/maim characters - this promotes communication and collaborations between members.

The unexpected that isn\u2019t fun to play, those who do things out of spite, and those absurdly powerful characters that nobody enjoys interacting with. I really enjoy things that are unexpected, but not at the complete destruction of everything I enjoy doing.For example, recently my character was going to have dinner with Kate Green. The relevant posts are on page 41 of The Midnight Sun. @hasdrubal came in, and lopped his own head off. I had no idea he was going to do that, and in character, Naoki was very much displeased. However, his action, though to the detriment of the in character situation, brought around a bunch more enjoyable RP, generated emotions, and the like. I'm sure a lot of you can relate.

Additionally, I think that more intervention on the part of the staff members would also do well to address some of these arguments. However, let me say this. The reason that I championed this discussion, this post, was to deal with one very particular problem, and to deal with it permanently. It is my nature to go to the root of things, and implement a fix that solves the issue, and all like it, now and forever. I also don\u2019t like to make things personal, so I figured that going and creating a civil discussion, not about a person, but rather about systems, would be a more polite way to accomplish our goal. Perhaps the changes that TFS as a body decides to implement would be an improvement, and prevent similar issues in the future, not only dealing with the problem of the now, but also preemptively fixing all future instances of the same sort of issue. However, if TFS as a whole isn\u2019t comfortable instituting such a wide reaching change, a much smaller scope... change could be made that addresses the current issue, and I would also be fine with that.

Specifically the bit about how you plan to avoid RPing with those who break the unspoken rules.  The rules state, quite clearly, that you must respond to them, if they come to you.  There is nothing in the rules preventing what is purely malicious PKing.The simple fact of combat in an RP like this is that there are few, if any, real rules.  There is no strict system that enforces at least a measure of balance.  Nor should there be, really.  Sometimes, the story calls for a player who can wipe the floor with everyone else.  The problem comes when someone creates a character whose design is not built to help the story progress, but merely as a means of \"winning\".  To win the \"game\" that is RP, they will simply pull more power out of nowhere, until their opponent is simply flatly outmatched.  And once the story turns into such a shallow reflection of one's own ego, there is no way to fight back.  The only way to respond to such is to resort to similar methods, pulling some nonsense out of thin air to preserve your character.My great problem, then, is that the current system allows those of lesser character to impose their own ego, by forcing no win situations on others.  Don't fight them, and you die.  Fight them, and you're nothing more than they are, a two year old saying that your imaginary friend is better than theirs.I think that most of us can agree that Zaltos is definitely the one who most often abuses this aspect.

Plus, I've also found that there is a lot of freedom in the things you can do to avoid actually dying. As much of a storytrap a game like this can be to tabletop players or players who get really tied to their characters or content, there are a number of other games that better suit those desires. In fact, most roleplays are more considerate of player content and less of a free-for-all. To those of us who actually want the lifelike aspects of risk and unpredictability mixed in with a little emotion and a ton of diversity, TFS is our only holy land and we would really hate to see it change. A number of these proposed changes, if not all of them, would infringe upon this experience in some way.Second, I also think limiting other players' choice to become a thorn in your side flattens the unpalictable, \"risky\" kind of experience that so readily connects TFS to real life feelings. This, to me, provide a sense of realism and immersion found in no such structured roleplay as D&D.Third, I think our admin has been more than reasonable in bringing disagreements from fights to a conclusion. I have been here since almost the beginning of this game (like my first RP was Jun's first RP and she's the main protagonist!) and the number of powergaming cases that are actually brought to 'judgement' are very small. A number of powergame issues would be solved cleanly with admin judgment.Fourth, drawing on my previous comment on how long I've played here, the upsetting events involving powergaming that have occurred throughout TFS' history have all stemmed from a very small subset of players (you know who you are). THAT SAID, I am absolutely willing to endorse a more expansive, definitive power cap beyond \"no gods.\" There are some players who I think need \"hard-coded\" limits to the \"sheer power\" (better definition pending) or physical size of something in order to play more fair with others.Fifth, I think the majority of players, characters, and their associated experiences and roleplays have been positive. I truly think the majority if not all of the defenseless characters on TFS are smartly engaged in places and scenarios that minimize the risk of sudden death.Sixth, and last but not least, the strength of an godmoder's attack in their words, provided it isn't a melee attack, is usually fairly relative because it's typically something paranormal and undefinable IRL. Because these things can't be measured, there's the turns-to-prep concept. Basically if I take two turns to prep my fireball vs. his one turn defense, he has to take some damage. If they don't, I'd seek a judgment and that judgment would probably be based on prep. I have absolutely no fear about coming into a fight with a known godmoder because I would just report them when they cheated.Combining all six of these perspectives, I actually kind of like the way things are and that the actual danger to people's content and feelings might become over-embellished if we ruminate on the many possibilities (however rare they may be) of us losing content or characters to another player's whim. I would support some changes (or more preferably, just some limits or definitions), but it's hard to define one that doesn't step on the concept that draws a lot of players like myself to this game over all the other games out there.Well to my knowledge, very few people want to prep anything. They're always trying to one post it. Despite popular opinion, if anyone reads my posts the few times I've actually been in combat, you'll realize most of my characters take 2-3 posts minimum for an attack. So while others may not like it, i'm with you Jill. If you don't prep shit, it ain't shit. People can fuss and fight about who's weak and strong, but it all boils down to the details.\u00a0Naoki wants to say she might be attacked, well how do you think everyone else feels? Zaltos and Ildesias are probably two that should worry since they do lead the main nations in the Overworld. Zaltos more so due to the militaristic views he has. So in turn, everyone takes a risk here.\u00a0Again, if you don't seek a fight, don't piss someone off to make them want to fight you. Since you're involved with evil with the Midnight Sun, you can't have it both ways. You have to expect someone will come around and want to wreck you. If you set a group with NPCs and such, you have to acknowledge you put yourself in that position.Anywho, leave it how it is!!", "link_list": ["/post/20942/thread", "/user/111"], "image_list": ["http://oi66.tinypic.com/am8mkn.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@jill\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/20942/thread\" timestamp=\"1452483230\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-111\" title=\"Jill\"><img alt=\"Jill Avatar\" src=\"http://oi66.tinypic.com/am8mkn.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/20942/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1452483230000\" title=\"Jan 10, 2016 19:33:50 GMT -8\">Jan 10, 2016 19:33:50 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-111 group-0\" href=\"/user/111\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@jill\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Jill</span></a></span> said:</div>Here's my two bitcoins:<br><br/>First, I've always approached this game with it in mind that your character can be killed by other characters and settings and not to grow too attached.

In fact, I think I might be its newest? Not entirely sure, but I haven't been here all that long. Alden and I joined at around the same time, but even so, I've managed to make <i>way</i>\u00a0too many characters because the storylines are all <i>so</i>\u00a0engaging.<br><br/>I've already had a character die, another character has broken her leg and will limp for the rest of her life, another was banished from her home country, and another still hasn't received the news that her brother was killed in a duel. I have never built a character thinking that my character was going to survive until the end, and when I know that I will be making a character in a sandbox where anything else can stomp around, I do it with the knowledge that if I make a completely defenseless Disney Princess damsel (which will happen soon), that I am at the mercy of the other players.<br/><br/>In my short couple of months here, I've found a community of people that seem mature and willing to discuss if they have issues with storylines, battles, or character development, and almost every single one of them have come to a conclusion that each of the players involved have been content with.<br/><br/>Basically, all of us seem to play just fine in the sandbox, and any discussions about needing character caps are only on the table because of a very, very, very, very select few people that are quite obviously abusing the system. In my opinion, nothing needs to change.<br/><br/>It's almost as if most everyone here roleplays with a sense of a Gentleman's Code. Those that don't abide, are clearly not a gentleman, and it'll be my choice to avoid roleplay with those that are clearly and unashamedly taking advantage of the freedoms of the sandbox.<div class=\"quote_clear\"></div></br></div></div>There is one singular, fundamental problem with this idea.  Specifically the bit about how you plan to avoid RPing with those who break the unspoken rules.  The rules state, quite clearly, that you must respond to them, if they come to you.  There is nothing in the rules preventing what is purely malicious PKing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The simple fact of combat in an RP like this is that there are few, if any, real rules.  There is no strict system that enforces at least a measure of balance.  Nor should there be, really.  Sometimes, the story calls for a player who can wipe the floor with everyone else.  The problem comes when someone creates a character whose design is not built to help the story progress, but merely as a means of \"winning\".  To win the \"game\" that is RP, they will simply pull more power out of nowhere, until their opponent is simply flatly outmatched.  And once the story turns into such a shallow reflection of one's own ego, there is no way to fight back.  The only way to respond to such is to resort to similar methods, pulling some nonsense out of thin air to preserve your character.<br/><br/><br/><br/>My great problem, then, is that the current system allows those of lesser character to impose their own ego, by forcing no win situations on others.  Don't fight them, and you die.  Fight them, and you're nothing more than they are, a two year old saying that your imaginary friend is better than theirs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>I think that most of us can agree that Zaltos is definitely the one who most often abuses this aspect.  Just recently his latest character dodged focused fire from no less than an entire organization of PCs, and acted like there was some \u2018skill\u2019 involved in it.  His presence there was neither requested, desired, nor appreciated. (IC or OOC)<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, even if we somehow deal with him on a permanent basis, the tools that he abuses will remain.  I believe that the solution is not to attack Zaltos as a person, but to disarm him.  <br/><br/><br/><br/>I believe that the best way to do this is to implement the \"no combat without OOC permission\" rule.<br/><br/><br/><br/>There are characters in play who if they ever see combat, WILL die.  They and their players DESERVE some degree of protection from those who would just stomp them into the dirt  (particularly if they do so only because they can).<br/><div class=\"quote_clear\"></div></div></div>"}, "post-21001": {"user": "Garo Zelsai", "user_num": 33, "timestamp": "1452531409000", "message": "I don't think it matters who's characters are OP when the things they do are not reported to the admin", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "I don't think it matters who's characters are OP when the things they do are not reported to the admin"}, "post-21011": {"user": "Trogdor", "user_num": 145, "timestamp": "1452542397000", "message": "If I might be so bold.

If I wanted to I could have tried to cause more havoc but I would have been killed by now (and it still might come to that). \u00a0Instead Medan started making ballistas\u00a0to protect themselves in the future, Trogdor was able to solve some of his anger issues, Zaltos got a dragon, and Giplor and Grandma are now considering dragon laws in their cities. \u00a0Destructiveness is the first step of creation.I agree with all the proposals that Empress Naoki   has set forth because I have seen them all in action on the sight already.  The players on this site are mature enough to use them without having them set in stone.A few examples:\u00a0SPOILER: Click to showMy first fight was with Fenris  .  I had a set up a quest and had a few smaller fights planned out for characters that wanted to fight Trogdor.  Fenris didn't notice the quest and attacked my lair his own way (which was ok). Through out the fight due to grammar errors, egos, and not wanting our characters to die we messed up a bit and got into a heated OOC argument over who did what when and why they shouldn't have.  There were ups and downs to it all but in the end my character was able to grow from the conflict. We settled the scene.In a recent incident I came to Isra. I had assumed that Trogdor would most likely cause some trouble so I waited at the Dragon Spire a few days then flew around a few more trying to give people time to start reacting. Albeit I forgot to post at the boarder first so maybe no one saw me.  I destroyed an abandoned building (when someone could have stopped me).  You can think of that as destruction but I think of it as a change in the scene to make it new and exciting again.Next, more controversially, I attempted to eat Kate.  I didn't just snap her up.  First I let my character get angry then put him in a position where he could attack from.  After that we talked about it IC and I thought that Kate was ok (even enthusiastic) with being attacked.  I offered her a dice roll and commented that Genevieve's response would help dictate my actions.  The next day Kate said OOC that it wasn't her time to die and Genevieve had used Trogdors only weakness (flattery).  In the end a powerless and oblivious character was able to survive a confrontation with a hostile aggressor.TLDR; Over all I think that we are doing well with the current rules. \u00a0But conversations like these are important to remind ourselves that this is a team effort. \u00a0While it is easy for emotional conflicts to arise OOC this is a driving force for progression IC.", "link_list": ["/user/607", "javascript:void(0);", "/user/168"], "image_list": [], "html": "If I might be so bold.
