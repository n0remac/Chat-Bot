If you have a specific idea, though, by all means, voice it.Maybe have it be something along the lines of equal forces with unequal commanders. I will admit that I'm not really up-to-date regarding this war, but it does seem kind of crappy (and anti-climatic) that, if the forces would have been equal before people started dropping out in the middle of the scene, a majority of the force were to be eradicated \"off-screen.\" Would it be possible that, since each character only represents 100 men (according to your rules on group), you have that represent how many men it is in their capacity to lead.Basically, allow him to access all 1000 (Or however many the Goraians started out with for this battle) but the remaining characters may only order 1 unit (100 or so men) per post (i.e. a force with only one player remaining may only move or attack with 1 group per turn, while a force with 10 players can move or attack with 10 groups per turn). Clearly, a unit that doesn't get orders can be more vulnerable to attack (as well as not being able to strike back as well, or at all). This way, the side that's missing players still gets the flexibility of a whole army, while the side with all its players present still has an advantage in the form of being able to move the entirety of its force per turn.", "link_list": ["/post/59496/thread", "/user/607"], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/jxxfhPa.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@madamenaoki\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/59496/thread\" timestamp=\"1485023343\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-607\" title=\"Empress Naoki\"><img alt=\"Empress Naoki Avatar\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/jxxfhPa.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/59496/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1485023343000\" title=\"Jan 21, 2017 10:29:03 GMT -8\">Jan 21, 2017 10:29:03 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-607 group-0\" href=\"/user/607\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@madamenaoki\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Empress Naoki</span></a></span> said:</div>I think that considering that almost all of Goraia is inactive and ineligible, and any changes to Isra's characters won't affect this battle negatively unless we all die while waiting for Goraia's next post to come, an understanding wherein you're stuck with the paltry forces you have on hand now could very probably be reached. <br><br/>I wouldn't recommend it, though.

At the beginning of the war, less Goraian characters were active than there are at present. The forces were at no point anywhere close to equal. Further, I don't see why the rules on groups would apply here at all, as neither party is a group. Groups are perhaps most comparable to minor factions. The best example is the Hunting Legion. They're a group of bandits\u00a0and are unaffiliated with any nation. They receive 100 points per active character to be NPCs in their group.\u00a0What's happening at New Brimiarde is a war between nations, wherein both parties are allowed 1,000 NPC points per active character in the nation.

There are no groups involved.\u00a0Your idea regarding allowing characters to command only a limited number of NPCs is an interesting one, but not one I think would be applicable here. Not now that the battle has already begun, and not without the rule being ironed out and agreed upon in advance by both parties. If put into place now, it will favor one party over the other.
