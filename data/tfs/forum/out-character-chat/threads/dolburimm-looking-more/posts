I'm looking to come back and hopefully stick around this time. The reason I usually leave is because my ideas don't pick up traction and I try to RP on my own for a little before getting fed up and leaving. As such I'm looking for interest in my new concept which I'm looking to run with.Dolburimm [Pronounced Dol-Bur-Im] is a Dwarven city state/government located on the coast somewhere (Still to be determined). Now these aren't your ordinary subterranean Dwarves no, these are a refreshing twist on an old favourite. The Dwarves of Dolburimm have carved out a city for themselves in a coastal cove where they utilize all that the sea has to offer. These Dwarves do not wear heavy armour or excel in close quarters combat, instead they are masters of engineered combat on the waves. From atop their masterly crafted vessels they reign down crossbow bolts and ballista fire on those that seek to damage their way of life.\u00a0Dolburimm is a wealth of resources plucked from the currents of the ocean along with it's highly sort after boats. The lands surrounding the city have become increasingly hostile causing the isolated folk to draw into their city. With no skill at land based combat and no means of farming or logging for timber the Dwarves are forced to look outside for aid. They hold religion in high regards and pray to some patron(s) of the sea (Still to be fleshed out) but are otherwise welcoming and friendly people who don't fully understand the ways of other civilizations. So that's all I've got so far. I'm looking for people who'd want to create a Dwarven citizen of Dolburimm primarily with an aim to get enough people to make a fully fledged government. Of course if your interested we can sit down as a group and talk about any potential changes or tweaks before things are set in stone. Secondly I'm looking for outside officials from other governments who would be interested with interacting with the Dolburimm leadership and people in any way, shape or form.Anyway that's all I've got to write for now. Thanks for taking the time to read this (If that is indeed what you did) and I look forwarding to reading your replies and feedback.\u00a0Oh and here's a taste of what could be.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://img13.deviantart.net/d356/i/2012/181/4/1/the_city_of_shakar_by_noahbradley-d55frpt.jpg"], "html": "Now I know many of you don't know me but I used to frequent here a while back in the days of Medan, Solaria and Katishma.
