Most of the threads were old, most posted over a year ago. While I do recall reading that old threads would be deleted in order to keep things fresh around here, and with me being new, I also realize I don't know the frequency of this pruning.\u00a0Thus it brings me to the topic I have in mind. Do you think it's a bad idea to start archiving old topics, or out-right deleting them?\u00a0I know there is a certain appeal to something I like to call \"Forum Density\", which roughly translates into the number of threads on all the sections in here, but I do also like neatness and organizing. And seeing that at the bottom of page 2 and there-after here in the OOC section alone, all the threads are 6+ months old. (Roughly)My primary intention with this topic is simply to bring something to talk about in a civil manner. I honestly expect no change in the current situation, but it would be nice, for me, to see the opinion of the casual forum browser here in TFS.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Miss-leading, \u00a0click-baity thread title for the win.\u00a0"}}
