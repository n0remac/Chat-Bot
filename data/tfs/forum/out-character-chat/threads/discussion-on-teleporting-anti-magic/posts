I've been told that anything unexplainable by science in the game is magic, thus Maes's teleportation, which is actually him moving through the space between spaces rather a magical tunnel, is considered magic (and I'm totally fine with that, it's all just flavor anyway).If anti-magic blocks teleportation, than I like the \"osh-\" mechanic of suddenly ending up wherever the AM zone begins instead of at the intended target.
