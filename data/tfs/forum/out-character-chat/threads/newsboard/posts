This was the result of a no confidence vote put forward by The Minister of Justice Ryden Greyiron. The Minister of Justice threw some slanderous allegations at Mr. Sephiran, who refuted them all vigorously. Regardless of the veracity of these allegations the vote was put forward and by a thin margin Mr. Sephiran was voted out of office. Following this there was a complete restructuring of the cities governmental bodies. \u00a0We just recently had our new High Lady installed and already one of our former lords longest serving ministers has been sacked. With these new changes we see both Ryden Greyiron and Empress Naoki filling multiple seats on the council. With all these changes this reporter can't help, but be worried. Is our new High Lady shouldering too much of the burden? Was Minister Greyiron's move well intentioned? Or was it a power play? When asked for comment on the proceeding Lady Naoki had this to say:\u201cWell, it\u2019s a shame that Tyrus was voted out, he seemed like a fine enough man to me. But I suppose that\u2019s why I\u2019m not in charge of the Judiciary Department, responsible for such things. Ryden, though, also seems fine enough to me, and he has big plans for restructuring the government, which I like. His plans should lead to a great increase in efficiency, and I always enjoy that.\u201d-Empress NaokiNon-committal, but marginally optimistic words from our lady.
