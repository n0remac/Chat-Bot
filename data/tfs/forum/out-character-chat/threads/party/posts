However tacking on to new plots is somewhat difficult. So instead I propose \"the party.\" This would follow a sort of DnD style creation of a party of people of various backgrounds, though preferably starting off relatively humble. It would be a minimum of three but absolute maximum of seven or eight. Each player would take turns GMing some sort of \"quest\" or event for the party, and when there are some on the quest boards we as a collective would join, if they need such a big group anyway. This would hopefully create a continuous story with all the wonders of being in a group whilst avoiding becoming a \"clique.\" There would be a one week timer for posts, which may be extended if something happens but should be kept to; if it is not that person is skipped in the round of posts and if it continues they get written out of \"the party.\" It would be a great place for characters to build up stories and \"meet new people.\" Preferably joining characters shouldn't have too much posts and existing backstory but they can still be added if \"humble\" enough, although completely new characters would also be good. So, any interest?\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "I wasn't wholly sure if I should post in the quest thread instead but here I go.\u00a0"}}
