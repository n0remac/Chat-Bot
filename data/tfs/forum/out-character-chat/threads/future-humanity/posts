No joke, whatever the future of humanity is gonna be like, it's definitely not gonna look like this.Technology and population growth can't happen infinitely.I imagine things crumbling slowly while humans continue to develop ways of coping with the world. I imagine people growing consciously and becoming more aware. I'd like to imagine us taking control away from the current system of government which is being bought out by selfish interests.I'd like to imagine humans collectively doing what's right for the world, because the smartest and kindest people lately seem to be the ones least likely to make it into that power structure. The people with the greatest capacity to change the world seem to have the least amount of power, and when one comes close, they become overwhelmed and antagonized.I think those of us who know we care about people and the world more than anyone else need to get ourselves out of a funk and start fighting back. I think we need to volunteer more, write more, express ourselves more, learn more, do more, even if it's painful, because the world needs people, and the few good people out there trying to make a difference need to know they're not alone.However, this is likely true, whether you consider this a blessing or a sad fact: humans will survive, even if our lives are unrecognizable centuries from now.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "I don't even know..."}, "post-3805": {"user": "The Phoenix State", "user_num": 208, "timestamp": "1433538467000", "message": "Humanity will be flooded out by technology.
