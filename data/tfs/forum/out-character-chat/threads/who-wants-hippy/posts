Well, we're sick of getting overlooked. =[I'm looking for people who wanna play as clan elders who are trying to bring the tribe out of isolation and share their knowledge of agriculture and earth magic to the Overworld. Their mission is to help make the Overworld a peaceful, prosperous place.I'm not very strict. Some suggestions are: 1. The clan name should be based on a plant, however loosely.2. The clan should be relatively progressive. At the very least the women should have rights.3. The clan should have aesthetics based on cultures not known for heavy armor or metallurgy, but are closer to nature. Native American, African, Viking, Indian, or ancient Mongol cultures for example. Roman, Arabic, and Byzantine would NOT be a good fit. Or, to put it another way, more Elfish than Dwarfish.The characters should be peaceful, but not defenseless. In fact, I recommend high power earth and water magic and extremely high level archers.Basically, go out, be helpful, and bring the gift of agriculture and peace of love and shit to the Overworld.", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/407/land-tillers-tribe"], "image_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/407/land-tillers-tribe", "https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/35/77/36/35773651865b6aafffade51e3c42ed5a.jpg", "https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjmyrrP-4vKAhVI2GMKHf1pDX4QjRwIBw&url=http%3A%2F%2Flotsoflowe.deviantart.com%2Fart%2FLegolas-429403838&bvm=bv.110151844,d.cGc&psig=AFQjCNHuylAZsRFLFLmLLQ2PD-St4ITNbA&ust=1451852843883463", "http://pre11.deviantart.net/68cf/th/pre/i/2014/067/b/a/legolas_by_jow3ew0l-d73nm4e.png", "http://orig02.deviantart.net/cf25/f/2010/245/e/8/atla_toph_by_arugaisou-d2xttem.jpg"], "html": "<a href=\"http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/407/land-tillers-tribe\" rel=\"norewrite\" target=\"_blank\">The Land-Tiller Tribe</a>"}, "post-20311": {"user": "Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui", "user_num": 102, "timestamp": "1451772949000", "message": "", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/094/719/005523.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/094/719/005523.jpg\" src=\"http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/094/719/005523.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/>"}, "post-20313": {"user": "Ildesias Xen Torsal", "user_num": 193, "timestamp": "1451774180000", "message": "I want to congratulate you on fantastic marketing.
