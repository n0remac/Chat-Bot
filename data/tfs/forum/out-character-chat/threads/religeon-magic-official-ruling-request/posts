Thank you for taking time away from being sweet smelling and nice to look at to read the words I'm currently typing.I have been thinking and reading, which led to more thinking and thus more reading, and with a new character in my mind I ask myself this: Is religion the same thing as magic? (In game here in our little corner of internet\u00a0fantasy, please I beg you let's not\u00a0get this confused with\u00a0belief in actual religion or actual magic.)To ask the same question another way, if a God (for lack of a better term) gives a character dominion over all of the wild blue-speckled polka dotted radioactive tree otters, and said character is able to communicate and call the wild\u00a0blue-speckled polka dotted radioactive tree otters to his/her side (say for the purposes of combat or building a damn in a river), is that magic, or religion, or are they the same thing? What if, in our fantasy, there are NO wild\u00a0blue-speckled polka dotted radioactive tree otters, and they must be summoned from.. wildbluespeckledpolkadottedradioactivetreeotter-ville?\u00a0(name pending)\u00a0Does that change things?I'd love to hear what anyone has to say on the subject but an officially officious ruling would be great.Thanks! -Badger", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["//storage.proboards.com/6046952/images/5AgYdAfn8rATue75bHkc.png"], "html": "<p>Hello to all of you fabulous denizens of TFS, otherwise known far and wide as Taco Free Saturdays!

So if your character's lore explains a power as the gift of a god or goddess, it makes the lore interesting, but for all intents and purposes that ability is no different than another player's magic. There are a couple things to consider when evoking religion in your character's lore.A. Players actually cannot play as gods or goddesses that are defined as invincible or all-knowing/all-powerful/all-anything. This means a power explained by a religious background lore is no different than a power explained by some other background lore.B. The religion, god, or goddess mentioned will have no overarching adherence across the board. Someone could make dragon character that they claim is the \"thunder god,\" but some other character could have their own version of the \"thunder god\" in their profile. All of it is fairly meaningless to the actual mechanics of the game.So to answer your question, religious fantasy powers (being solely a lore-explanation for a power and nothing else) is no different than magic, which itself is wholly compatible with telekinesis, anti-magic, \"raw energy\" attacks, and the works. All manifestations of paranormal \"power\" are treated the same under the game rules.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The way it works is any supernatural force or ability are considered to be compatible with one another.
