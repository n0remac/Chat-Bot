Ukufa is heading north, and will appear in 3 different locations. I list his current abilities, tools, and possible allies, and anyone from the black tower can challenge him to a PvP battle.His typical abilities are CQC and range combat with poisonous weapons, mental manipulation, dark magic tools, and command over several minions.Here's the catch. If they fail to kill him in 3 turns, Ukufa's \"rot fog\" ability will activate. The fog will cover his escape and rapidly decay anything biological or magical that tries to stop him. That said, it may still be possible to circumvent the fog with metal projectiles or certain types of magic. But it won't be easy. The ability is essentially magic and anti-magic rolled into one.On the third battle, Ukufa will almost be close to home. More minions will appear, and even another ally may show up. In all three battles, Ukufa will aim to kill the first three turns, then flee. But I'm thinking on the final battle, Ukufa will not stop fighting until at least one person is dead, either a hunter... or himself.We could probably use a third party judge to help decide the battles.But anyways, it's just a brainstorm.
