Joining me as a guest this lecture is Samaelin Akkut\u2019ra, God of Powerpoint Presentations and Exposition.  He\u2019s really only here in a desperate bid for relevance.\u201dSamaelin nods at this.\u201cNow, for whatever reason, you\u2019re here because you want to learn about how gods work.\u201dHe grabs a piece of chalk, and scrawls three large, nested circles on the chalk board.\u201cWhether you believe in them or not, gods are out there, making stuff work.  Most of them like to be noticed.  It\u2019s a nice ego boost if you\u2019re the minor god of elephant poop.  There are actually something like three to four gods for every human on earth.  Getting somebody to worship you is hard.  In  order to gain notoriety, most gods attempt to join one or more pantheons.  The particular pantheon I serve likes to think it\u2019s cool and original, and so it call itself \u2018The Pantheon\u2019.\u201dHe raps the board in the center of the innermost circle.\u201cGods are a lot like cats, in that herding them is really dang hard, but they can be categorized, to some extent.  Most pantheons are built around a couple of so called \u2018timeless\u2019 gods.  They embody concepts that are fundamental, and will have relevance regardless of anything you can or will do.  Susan is an excellent example of this, as she is Fate.  It\u2019s simply not possible to get out from under her thumb.  I should know, I\u2019ve tried.\u201dHe bangs the board on the middle circle.\u201cThe second category are gods who are currently relevant, but might not remain so.  A good example is the god of Bronze.  Back in his glory days, he was the master of industry and war the world over.  Now Bronze is used for some minor decoration.  Nobody wants to worship the god of minor decoration.  I know I don\u2019t!  Gods in this category are usually fairly important, sometimes even more important than a Timeless, but that power and notoriety fades with time.\u201dRapping the final circle, he continues,\u201cThe last category are the irrelevant gods.  Sometimes they get invited to parties, because even gods have social niceties.  Most of these gods either embody some concept that is no longer relevant, or has not yet become so.  Some, like the God of Little Biscuits and Tea, are never going to be relevant.\u201dLooking out at the classroom, he asks.\u201cAll this clear?
