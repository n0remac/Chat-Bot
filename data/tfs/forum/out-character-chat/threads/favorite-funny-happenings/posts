Scratch that.If I had to narrow it down, there are a couple that stand out. First of all there was the time that Jun was training under the holy dragon Lum'Valia. She was learning how to split her mind two different ways so that she could summon multiple light constructs. Part of the training involved taking a rock, dropping it, and legitimately believing that the rock was falling up and down at the same time. After several hours of trying to do this, Lum'Valia walked in on Jun in a delusional state of mind.
