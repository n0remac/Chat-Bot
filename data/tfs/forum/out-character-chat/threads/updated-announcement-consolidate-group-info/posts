If you'd like something un-retired or moved, post on the Requests of Staff\u00a0page or speak directly to a staff member.As part of the recent revamping and clarification of the rules, the way that groups are handled has been changed. Read about it here, on the thread for Groups.All existing groups subforums will be retired on April 1st, 2016, including all threads and posts within. That\u2019s two weeks, fourteen days, from this initial announcement, as well as April Fool\u2019s Day, and also, coincidentally, my birthday. (    )As such, all existing groups will need to be converted over to this new, single thread system. As of a few minutes ago, the Groups forum has been opened to new threads. Group Leaders must create new threads on this forum to continue to have their groups persist. Any groups that are not moved to this new system will be considered defunct and retried with the rest. To clarify, each group- after the move, should have exactly one thread, directly on this forum, with all of their information within. Read here what must be on that thread, and feel free to copy whatever you'd like from any existing threads of yours.If you would like to request my assistance in moving threads, or have a question about this, post on this thread.
