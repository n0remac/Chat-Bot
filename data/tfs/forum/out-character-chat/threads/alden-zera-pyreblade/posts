He was returning to Isra after one of his various assignments out of town. His twin enchanted short swords at his side, wearing his rune inscribed black leather armor and enchanted cloak. As always his rune etched eyes flick around warily looking for any sign of danger. The stretch of road he is on is an old farmers trail worn in by passing wagons. He is on a stretch between two farms that cuts through a thick forest.
