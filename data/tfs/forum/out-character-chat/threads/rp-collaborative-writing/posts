Do you see this as an RP site only, or are their areas where it's acceptable to agree a CF approach?\u00a0Thanks", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Hey everyone,"}, "post-69972": {"user": "Empress Naoki", "user_num": 607, "timestamp": "1498526105000", "message": "I'm not entirely\u00a0sure what you mean by 'Collaborative Fiction', not having taken part, so I can't outline the differences\u00a0very well, but here are my thoughts. All this- it applies here. Other places may do things differently, I don't know.I would say that- generally speaking, the creator of the thread is more responsible for the setting of the thread than for the content of the thread, or \"twists.\" (Under the understanding that a thread in the Overworld represents a location in the game world.) What it does, how it might be affected by actions characters take, and things such as that.For example, one of my more popular threads is The Midnight Sun. It's essentially a combination bar and tavern in Isra, and the thread represents that physical location. As it's my\u00a0thread, I'm responsible for the setting there. For the barkeeps and the innkeeper, for the drunkards and miscellaneous staff members. I have an alternate account,\u00a0The Midnight Sun, that I use to represent anything having to do with the place.I'm also responsible for Isra as a whole- Isra's a nation, an empire, and a city. I use my account,\u00a0The Isran Empire, to represent things like guards, soldiers, the populace in a general sense, and to create locations in Isra. This Central Plaza, for instance. In the case of large areas governed by a group, a nation, the player responsible for the nation as a whole also has a degree of control over what threads other people make in it.\u00a0For example,\u00a0Renalt Fletcher has created this thread, entitled Fletcher's Delectables. It's a candy shop that he runs, in the city of Isra. Many other characters also have homes and shops inside the city, and each of those threads has my approval as a valid setting in the city. A thread representing a mountain, for instance, would not go inside the city.But the basis is as such. Threads represent locations. Sub-boards\u00a0(such as this one which is the city of Isra) represent an area in which other threads would be grouped in a logical way. Like a city, a castle, a nation's lands, a province, or some other grouping like that. Some players choose to act as 'GMs' and create threads in which they function in that manner. The best example of this is\u00a0Strangers and Travelers, an account that represents whatever exists in any of the threads they've made. When a character goes to an S&T thread, they can expect the setting there to be interactive and intending to express some sort of narrative.\u00a0Not all threads are necessarily\u00a0interactive, though. This thread, the Lavender Hills, are just literally hills covered in lavender flowers. No one is there, there's nothing there in particular to do besides interacting with other characters- which you can see there. I'm not going to post as that setting because there's no reason I would need to. I created the thread as a location to be used as part of some things that didn't pan out in the end. Now, it's just a place that characters can go, and I'm not responsible for creating any sort of story for them.Other threads are like that as well. The Saucy Maid Tavern, for instance, is used as just a general purpose tavern location, where the characters visiting can assume that the tavern functions, and serves them drinks and such. The Midnight Sun can work in that way as well if the character would like, because in some cases, the posts aren't about the location very much at all, and are only used as a place in which to interact with other characters.And all of that varies by the thread. A reasonable way to guess would be to consider if the setting has some active element that would be relevant to the character visiting, like the owner of a store, perhaps. Threads created by players who have since stopped playing- you're not going to get a response there either.But speaking in a general sense, I wouldn't necessarily say that the thread creator is expected to \"drive\" the RP or function as the GM for characters. They're more responsible for acting as whatever the thread represents, and it's usually up to the characters to make a story within the world at large.There are also quests, in which the quest creator may act as a GM. There's the Tower of Eons, which I'll just generalize and call a dungeon. It has this listing on the Quests board. The Tower's account acts as a GM for its thread, and within that thread, the setting- the tower, is actively affecting characters, with traps and monsters and stuff.In a separate category, there are also what I would call advertisements on the Quests Board, like this one. In that, I wasn't really offering to create much of a story for someone, but rather to enlist some character to go out and explore for me- places I don't own. There are also bounties, for example.In reading back on the above, I realize this is mostly rambling, and may not tell you what you wanted to know.

From many of the threads I read it did feel that the thread creator was directing the action, a helpful thing indeed, but almost made me nervous that they had strong plans for the action, so may not welcome independant plot twists that may hinder their narrative. It's difficult to know how much planning or forward thinking may have gone into the idea of the thread. I'm thinking about the open lands areas in particular as these feel like they could be anything from a tightly run RP adventure right through to a very loose collaborative fiction.To confirm what I mean by collaborative fiction, I see that as sharing complete control over all of the actors and plots in the story. There's no element of PvP, and is purely a collaboration to get the best story possible. You tend to put words in the mouths of other actors, trying to structure it more like a classic fiction so conversations flow differently, and there's less of a feeling to write what the character intends to do and then let it resolve. I'm in no way suggesting this pure form, but merely suggeting there's a scale between this and RPing that I'm trying to get a read on.Thanks again for taking the time to answer.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Wow, thanks for the detailed answer.

The sorts of thing I had in mind don't fit this model, so wouldn't work anywhere within the Overworld.That being said, I guess the Quests section falls outside the Overworld, and as such might be a place where there's more opportunity to do more freeform projects. I'm interested if others may have tried this in the past, or if this falls outside the scope of the site and what people want to do here.I'm conscious that with so much work having gone into having this strong framework for RP, and all of the lore and locations attached, that breaking outside of this may be detrimental to the site.It would probably help if I gave a solid example.====King Ralgian Brightsword was dead, the last in a line of kings that had ruled the 12 Kingdoms for over 700 years. With no heir apparent, the 12 Kingdoms would call its first Kingsmoot. The Lord Chancellor sends a variety of birds to the 12 kingdoms, advising them to send a representative of the noble family of each realm to discuss who could be the next ruler.Player representatives arrive, and pad out the background of their kingdom and family. There's an OOC thread where people openly discuss their plans and objectives, and players take turns having complete control to post interactions and weave the story.====I am interested if this has been done before, or if people are doing this behind the scenes via PM anyway, and I'm just missing the more long-term, shared objectives. In the example above I guess I'm conscious of both the nature of the location (12 Kingdoms that players are free to design themselves) existing within a single thread, a thread that is intended to work more like a piece of fiction than a part of the structured Overworld, and the more blatant idea of this round-robin type control.I do like the idea of having OOC threads to discuss specific threads. Having some OOC perspective of what other authors are intending feels like a great way to iron out a more consistent, interwoven story, but I guess this speaks to what lies at the heart of the difference between RP and collaborative fiction.I'm happily \"playing\" a thread in the Overworld, and the Character + Location system works great so I'm gladly enjoying TFS, I was merely interested in where players may have pushed the boundaries of what's already here.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "I think I was underestimating the fact that the Overworld threads are actually locations, rather than projects or adventures, and that they all actually coexist within a very strong Character + Location framework.
