{"post-87423": {"user": "Moonflower L\u00e0idir", "user_num": 1010, "timestamp": "1543808173000", "message": "Hello everyone, it's your favorite Moonkat, returned to TFS and boy have I got some stuff to do! But some of it I need a little help with before I can get it rolling, so, I'm coming to you with an offer that might be a bit unconventional. There are a few characters on here that were once played by someone who has since left TFS, which happens every day, right? Well unfortunately some of those characters are either, A) Somewhat important to what I want to do, or B) I just want to start playing with them again. This means that I was given permission by that player to put these characters up for adoption. As of right now, they've been tied to my account, but I have zero desire to play them, because, yanno, I don't want to play with myself. (That's what she said?) So if you're interested in playing the character, and are actually going to be somewhat serious about it - like, don't take one or more of them and then go throw them off a cliff or something equally unpleasant/ridiculous - then feel free to respond here or shoot me a message. Preferably on Discord, I'm far more likely to respond there. (Kat#3924)ALRIGHT, the characters up for adoption are listed below in order of most needed/wanted to least, and I'll include a small blurb about why they're needed/wanted and possibly what they might've been up to over the past few in-character years.The Winged Blade of Justice -- This dude is the counterpart to my character Lady Ysaera, and they're in charge of the Nation of Esdara. \"But Moonkat,\" I hear you cry. \"Esdara is closed down!\" Yeah well all I gotta say to that is not for long, baby. I've got a whole badass quest in mind to bring that place back and it's gonna be fun, let me tell you. Anyone interested in taking on the High Priest should be prepared for a bit of in-character running of the show, but most of the OOC stuff I'll handle myself. I might ask your opinion on stuff sometimes but not a whole lot. However I can't get Esdara up and running again without him! Serious inquiries only on this one, for real.Valerian Kastimeer -- This one is definitely more of a 'want' than a 'need', though Naoki might want her Admiral back (though I assume he's probably been replaced, Idk). Valerian was romantically involved with my character Emahra Untyrid and I am mega attached to her, so I'd like to see her and Valerian reunited. Ema was off for a few years with Takhana Veil (another character of mine) looking for a way back to her home on another plane. Maybe she decided to do this because she and Valerian split? Had a fight? Something? We can discuss it if you want to pick him up but I definitely want these two to get their romance back on.Captain Arthur Maddock -- Arthur isn't that big a deal tbh. He's involved with my character Eirwynn Rodrick, they're sky pirates with a flying ship from Alban (I guess they're technically privateers), and maybe they've just been exploring the world the past few years. Might be fun to do some adventures with them but Arthur is a low priority.Madadh Allaidh -- Madadh is even lower priority. He's the leader of the Wildlings in Alban, and yeah, Alban is defunct, so really not a big thing. He's also mated to my character Boireann Allaidh, and yeah it'd be fun to play them again, but I'm not pushing for it.Well there you have it! If anyone is interested in picking up one/all of these characters, just contact me in some way and we can set up a transfer of ownership. I figured out how to add the accounts to different global accounts, so I can talk you through it if you need some assistance.

Age: 967Physics description: A well muscled man looking as if he was in his late twenties or early thirties, he has few scars and a handsome face with aristocratic features from both his parents and silver eyes and hair inherited from his father. Clothes and equipment: He carries a blade smelted down from the same fangs and claws of his pack members who fell in the War of the Blood Moon, and his clothes are woven from their fur. Both are supernaturally durable and have magical properties. When he shifts they shift with him, lending his claws and fangs an even more deadly edge and his pelt a durability unmatched by any but the strongest of enchantments. While bathed in moonlight they glow from within and move with the silence of the light that empowers them. Powers and abilities: he has all of the powers of a Silver Dusk Pack-member as well as his father\u2019s immortality and extreme durability. Along with this he has spent his long life learning all he could as he has traveled, becoming a jack of all trades, a cunning linguist, and a deadly swordsman of near peerless skill. Personality: an open and caring person, Xar finds himself unable to stand aside and let evil fester. As he often says when asked: \u201cAll that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.\u201d ", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CgWOmCtVIAAxmzi.jpg"], "html": "\u00a0Name: Xar Greypetal"}, "post-89397": {"user": "Karga Oldfang", "user_num": 3262, "timestamp": "1551741155000", "message": "And Xar Greypetal has been claimed.
