{"post-25550": {"user": "Empress Naoki", "user_num": 607, "timestamp": "1456467515000", "message": "This is the beginning of a statement I am making regarding recent events, and my stance on the matter. I am referring, obviously, to the new-old nation of Goraia, and the players who are taking part in it. Let me start this off like this. I don\u2019t mind villains. To have an interesting story, you need some antagonistic elements, sometimes. I\u2019m not opposed to the concept of villainy, villainous characters, antagonistic actions, or actions that some might find offensive. As I\u2019ve been told, this is a sandbox, and things happen in it. Lots of things, without much regulation. However. I\u2019m here to have fun. And I have. I\u2019ve had a lot of fun. I haven't really done any creative writing before my date of joining last September, and since then, I\u2019ve been faced with all sorts of interesting and challenging posts to write. I enjoy posting, developing my character and interacting with the characters of others. I like it here, and I\u2019ve met a ton of interesting people, and befriended a lot of them. I don\u2019t really mind what anyone else does in their time in the sandbox. What sorts of power levels characters have, or what sorts of plots or actions they take. I\u2019m chill like that. Do what you want, I don\u2019t really care. However. Actions taken begin to concern me when they begin to endanger my enjoyment of the site, or my friends\u2019 enjoyment of the site. And this is where we begin to run into issues. If you remember, I brought up a similar topic a while back. Just last month, in fact. Though the faces were different, and the specific cause of friction not quite the same, the underlying issue persists between both issues. The thread I posted was here, and the gist of it was such that I, and a number of others, who are listed on the thread, thought that some manner of rule change was needed to prevent malicious individuals from interfering with the enjoyment of others. There was a lot more words to it than that, but that was the essence of what I had to say. However, my solution was shot down. People wanted to \u2018preserve the sandbox nature of the site\u2019 and \u2018deal with things on a case by case basis\u2019. And I said, essentially, \u201cAlright, fair enough.\u201dBut yet, here we are today, faced with just such a scenario, where a bunch of players appeared, and have stated, outright, that it is their intention to go around messing with characters that don\u2019t want to interact with them, and destroying other people\u2019s RPs and characters without their consent. So I think you can see where I start to have a problem with this. I- with many of my friends, am here to enjoy myself, and a bunch of people have just shown up, and stated that they intend to make that impossible. With that stated, why I have an issue, allow me to begin my actual statement. I\u2019m not opposed to the concept of doing RP with anyone. I\u2019m not opposed to the concept of an in character conflict, or a war involving my character. However, I am very vehemently opposed to the concepts of characters invading threads where they are not wanted, with the intention to kill characters that the character\u2019s player does not want to lose. (This also extends to slavery and violation and all that. Generally doing things to characters that are against the wishes of their player. Killing characters that are fine with being killed, or doing things that are consensual are still fine, I don\u2019t care.)Additionally, I am opposed to the concept of playing unfairly, or attempting to dogpile Goraia with every nation and character because they did some torture. I\u2019m also not here to argue. I don\u2019t like arguing, and don\u2019t like it when others do. I\u2019m not going to debate in circles, or try to settle things in chat. That\u2019s not my way, and I think it\u2019s a pretty ineffective way to deal with things like this. So this is my action; this is how I\u2019m handling this. If Goraia wants to play fairly, and interact in ways that are both fair and enjoyable for all involved parties, players, and characters, fair enough. I\u2019ll acknowledge them, and play fairly in return. This is the most preferable outcome for me. I would like to see the effects of a war on Isra, and would like to play in a wartime environment, that sounds fun in concept. However. If Goraia, as they\u2019ve stated it is their intent, begin to introduce themselves where they\u2019re not wanted (ex: The Chalet), and begin to take offensive action against characters who don\u2019t want to be enslaved, violated, killed, or any of that, I\u2019m going to stop interacting with and achkowlegeing them. Just completely. I refuse to play with people that intentionally work to the detriment of others. I\u2019m not going to do it, a bunch of other people are of like mind, and will assuredly do the same. And additionally, if players proceed to act in this way, and if the site\u2019s administration refuses to take a stance one way or the other and take action to remove the conflict, I\u2019ll leave. Not going to play in a place that allows people to come in and ruin everyone else\u2019s fun. I enjoy the sandbox element of the site and everything I\u2019ve done, but not enough to stick around and be besieged by a bunch of intentionally malicious players. I\u2019m not interested in combat, or my character being killed. I\u2019ll take my business elsewhere, as it were. I\u2019m going to go ahead and dump some quotes right down here, to illustrate my point and justify my course of action. I\u2019ve said none of these things myself, these are the direct quotes of my like minded fellows. \u201cI just want to enjoy this world and I can't do that when there's the constant threat of people swooping in to wreck everything just because they want to.\u201d\u201cI just want a place to play where I don't have to worry about my characters being embroiled in a war I have no interest in. There's no such luxury when they openly state the intent to invade and destroy and kill mercilessly.\u201d\u201cI find this whole thing to be appalling. I'm fine with horrible evil bad guys but not with this. This is intentional, malevolent, asinine, and straight up assholey behavior.\u201d\u201cNever eat sour watermelon.\u201d [This one is unrelated, but he asked me to include it anyway.]So, in summary and conclusion, my stance is as thus. We don't mind if you [Goraia] sit over there and do your thing. We'll engage in interactions as so long as the interactions are fun and enjoyable for both parties, but the moment that you lot start doing things to characters against the will of a player, or force combat on those who don't want it, we, as a group of like minded people, will refuse to play with you.As with the last thread I posted in this OOC forum, I encourage civil, OOC discussion working toward a resolution or stating your own stance on the matter. However, please don't let this topic degrade to the crude insult-fest or levying of threats.

But I am not comfortable with how things are progressing. I've been informed of a great deal many things from a great deal many players and they've expressed similar concerns.For starters I'm with Naoki on my stance with villains. It's fine if they're going to be dastardly and evil, and just generally not good people. However that doesn't mean I'd welcome the idea of folks treading upon the works of others who feel quite passionately for their characters and the stories they've built around them. I hesitate to bring anyone up by name but Lamina is a perfect example of this.She was subjected to an experience that made her feel less than enthusiastic and had little recourse left for her other than to simply take it. That's not what I came here to do, I came here to create an interesting and colorful world setting with a group of people in a cooperative environment. Instead I'm finding myself getting boxed in with the looming threat of a suffocating nation that seems hellbent on causing a ruckus among the community.Once again I'd like to state that this isn't an inherently terrible thing, throwing in the occasional conflict is overall better for the story. However when those same people heavily imply that they are going to invade topics that they aren't welcome in and start wreaking havoc I start to draw a line. Wolfgang assured me that this wasn't going to happen but after seeing a screenshot of a conversation that took place over that very same topic and seeing what he had to say I'm not too sure if I can believe him.Especially since his response to the concerned question was. \"Yeah. Sorry. They're going to have to prepare IC, instead.\"That right there tells me that the possibility of such an invasion is wholly possible and even if he himself is not willing to go to that extreme the likelihood of it happening is still high enough to worry me.With that in mind I want to make myself clear. I will not stand for that, the people I see posting here are generally quite proud of the work they put in and cherish the storylines that they create with each other. If some evil minded jerk wad is liable to simply wander in and muck it all up and possibly even kill some of the characters involved just for the 'evlulz' I will not be pleased and I will raise a stink about things.

Everyone has their own unique definition of fun, and it's hard for anything but a mature player base to accommodate everyone's needs. A world that allows for anything to exist allows for the conceptualization of infinite pleasure and infinite pain, infinite creation and infinite destruction, infinite peace and infinite violence. And it all has a right to exist here.In my opinion, Goraia and their actions have a right to exist. We as the player base also have a right to oppose them within the limitations of the game itself.To me, this is a game. My favorite character, Jun, has indeed leveled up. She is stronger than she was when she entered the Sandbox. She went from being an amateur mage with an inferiority complex knocking on the door of Medan to being a mature, confident adult with the power to fight dragons. That is my definition of fun, pursuing the growth, development, and power of my character.Jun could kill the majority of the characters on the Sandbox in her current state. And due to the mechanics of the game, she has a right to do so. And she has so much supporting content that challenging her abilities is almost impossible. There are records of her creating light constructs, absorbing heat energy, firing energy blasts in one turn, healing, teleporting, using scrolls as weapons, and melee fighting. And they've ALL gone unchallenged.So how come no one complains about her?Because my idea of fun isn't to destroy people's creations or offend people. I like making friends and allies and helping to promote people's visions. Make no mistake though, I am a selfish player, but I do what I want to do while trying to maintain people's enjoyment of the game. I communicate my intentions and if I'm not welcome, I hold back.That said, my ability to grow and become powerful is predicated on the freedoms that support players like Goraia. At some point, Jun needs to get into conflicts in order to establish who she is, and to assert my desires from this game. Jun needs to be capable of death and of killing. Her life has to be threatened. If she can't actually die or if a villain can't attack her, or if she can't attack a villain, her existence has no meaning.So, in principle, I have to support what Goraia is doing. If I have a right to be a hero and help people, then surely Goraia has a right to be a villain and hurt people, and characters have a right to stop them.The Sandbox is a game. It was designed to be a game. It has an inter-government combat system in place, and a rule about character death, for a reason.So where does that leave us?In my opinion, what gives the friendships of the Sandbox meaning is the TRUST that people give each other. People trust my characters to not kill them. And I trust them to not kill me. This trust is based on communication.Here is where people like Zaltos, Goraia, and ultimately everyone with a problem with Goraia have messed up.They didn't communicate their intentions or try to work with everyone else.Remember, in this world, your vision can only exist with the cooperation of other people.If Zaltos had come right out and said he wanted to create a powerful empire, and wanted to be a badass, and was willing to work with the rest of the Sandbox to make his vision a reality, I think he would have gotten a lot more support. Likewise, if Goraia had stated their intentions, I think we'd be a lot happier. And I think if the rest of the player based had tried to work with Goraia, including (ironically) the admin herself, we'd all be much more satisfied.I'm not saying everything should be pre-planned or out in the open. I'm saying if we want to make everyon'e vision a reality, we have to be willing to communicate and work together.It is the fact that our spirit of cooperation and mutual understanding exists IN SPITE of the fact that we could all technically destroy each other's characters is what gives that sense of camaraderie MEANING.So unfortunately I have to disagree with Naoki. Goraia does have a right to capture and torture Lamina's character and threaten other players and their creations, and we do have a right to dog-pile their Eastern border and destroy their super weapon, if possible (I AM working on a way to destroy the tower, legally, within the confines of the game).***What I WANT to see happen, however, is an open dialogue concerning the intentions that Goraia has with Lamina and the rest of the Sandbox, a consensual agreement between Lamina and Goraia (and Goraia and the rest of us), and for Goraia to accept the consequences of their actions. If they are going to run an evil government that tortures its citizens, then they should expect to be attacked.HOWEVER, WE NEED TO ACCEPT THE CONSEQUENCES OF OUR ACTIONS! Medan has been mostly abandoned, and what little RP it did receive was from dragons attacking it and kingdoms threatening it. Story wise, it makes TOTAL sense for a power hungry dictator to gain power and control over Medan.Goraia is our fault. We should accept that. (well, except me and Lum'Valia. We tried to help them and bring friendly RP to them in game; so in that sense I do think I have a right to talk).The Sandbox was meant to mimic real world dynamics. And in the real world, people have to work together and compromise in order to get things done and benefit everyone. However, cooperation, friendly interaction, trust, and diplomacy only have meaning in a world where things can be threatened and destroyed.I would rather live in a world where we don't have to get along, but CHOOSE to, rather than a world where we have no choice.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Not to beat a dead horse, but here's my take on it."}, "post-25880": {"user": "Empress Naoki", "user_num": 607, "timestamp": "1456616056000", "message": "Feb 27, 2016 15:10:23 GMT -8 Jun of the Celadine said:...

I don't make any claims about what they have a right to do, that's not my station. I'm stating that if they're not going to be cooperative and do things in a way that is fair by what rules exist, and in a way that all involved parties find I, and other like minded people will refuse to play with them. I'm not trying to make assertions about the rules, say what people have a right to do, or make any sort of dissertation about the state of things in this post. Just saying that if they're not going to play nice, I'm not going to play with them. \\I get my jollies not so much by doing things myself, but doing things and creating scenarios that others find enjoyable. My enjoyment is directly related to that of my fellows. And if nobody is having fun, neither am I. I don't find any enjoyment in combat RP, and dog-piling Goraia would not be fun for me, or for them. I think that allowing OOC reactions to IC events influencing IC actions is meta-gaming, and I think that meta-gaming is an unfair and un-fun practice. I don't think that meta-gaming/dog-piling is a fair thing to do, and that's why I'm not doing it or encouraging those who are. But I don't care. I'm not going to stop you; do what you want. Just as long as nobody fools with my enjoyment of the \"game\", I have no issues.

I want to see more communication.I do think, in theory, your character is subject to the rules of death and destruction. However, that does not mean I would agree with it or think it's right. So I can only hope for, pray for, and encourage the prevalence of a mature environment where that doesn't happen.Going back to your previous post from a while back, I believe I did say I was in favor of a system that allowed for conditional exemption from combat that players could opt into.
