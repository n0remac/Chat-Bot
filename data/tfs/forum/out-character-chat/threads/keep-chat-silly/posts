First of all I recognize the seeming hypocrisy of this, coming from me. However I believe this needs to be said, and I have been trying, not alway successfully, to do this. There are a few reasons for this, the biggest though is that chat is one of the best features of this site. When the chat descends into arguing it drives a lot of people away.\u00a0The chat is also a useful tool for new players. It gives them a chance to get to know people before they start playing. If all the see of us is a bunch of angry bickering it might drive them away.\u00a0Last but not least it accomplishes nothing. If you have questions pm them to Jill and Zagarus, if they don't respond PM the admin. Going into chat to complain just makes us look petty. It also builds up our anger and makes us more likely to do something stupid.\u00a0Please join me in keeping chat silly. If someone tries to talk about the nation that shall not be named, turn the conversation to something silly. Maybe don't follow my lead by going to turtle dicks though.Also sorry for quality if this post I typed it on my phone.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Lets keep discussion relating \u00a0to, the nation that shall not be named, out of chat.

I'd hate to put out the impression that we fight like this all the time, though the fact we're so close and this roleplay is so good means that no matter how much some of us might want to leave at times, it's hard to do so we're all sort of in this place together. I think since the admin is personally affected by the event that happened while still having to keep her stuff in the game and chug along, it has been very hard for her to maintain order and she probably feels pushed into a corner. I always try to think how hard it must be for her right now and we need to help her maintain order and to regulate ourselves. I think actively trying to keep chat silly during such dark times is a very good initiative and I support this.What we must also remember however is that the chat is there to help us players hash things out and work out disagreements as well. Perhaps regarding technical issues of They-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named, we should have a titanpad or something, as the discussion on how to fight them and (more importantly) contingency plans and deterrents to possible attacks is still an important subject.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "I agree the last thing we want as a community is for newbies to turn away and leave.
