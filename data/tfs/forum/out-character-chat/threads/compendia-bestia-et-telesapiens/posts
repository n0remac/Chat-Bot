However, until now there has been no comprehensive guide to the various species that inhabit our world or even, in fact, those that inhabit other, parallel worlds. These compendia will be humanity's first attempt at cataloguing the various races and beasts that inhabit our world. Through the studies of myself and my world-wide contemporaries, I will attempt to capture the essence of those inhuman species which have captivated our collective interest for so long, and yet who have been entirely undocumented up until this point.Archmage Andraste Ruana, P.C. 192HUMANOIDSOf course, of all the various species that inhabit the Overworld, those who walk on two legs, have two grasping limbs, a singular head, and similar digestive and circulatory systems are of the most interest to most of us. This section describes those creatures in detail.Near-HumansSpecies that are descendant from humans, but are distinct enough to warrant their own classificationSuraithDiscovered by the enchanter and explorer James Lazael Deepwinter The Suraith are a fractious nomadic people and the only large group of beings who can claim the Ash Dunes as their home. While their ancestors were human, they are the descendants of the survivors of the Cataclysm and have been changed by the eldritch magics of the wastes. They have darkly tanned skin that ranges from a medium brown to a dark grey, and hair that ranges from blonde to silver to white. However, while these traits are somewhat uncanny, their eyes are the strangest of all; Where a normal man would have blue eyes, their eyes are a vibrant purple, their green is a brighter, glowing variety, and their brown is instead a bright orange.OverviewLifespan: Anywhere from 50 years to immortalDiet: Omnivorous Preferred climate: Anything not immediately fatalMagical Affinity: Ranges from complete absence to extremely strongAverage height: 90-250 cmAverage weight: 4-23\u00bd stoneIntelligence designation: SapientGovernmental structure: varies from tribalistic to monarchy to council leadTechnological progression: variesCurrent population and status: Unknown, thought to be less than 100,000 but more then 30,000 individuals. Demographic concentration: The Sea of Black SandsElvesSpecies that make up any of the subspecies of Elves across the Mainland -- usually pointy-eared, long-lived species with strong affinities for magic and nearly post-sapient intelligences.SindariA pre-cataclysmic race of Elves, the Sindari were mostly forest-dwellers. Not much is known about the Sindari lifestyle or culture, as most of their society was entirely wiped out by the Cataclysm itself, but recently attained Sindari papyrus-based tomes indicate that they were excellent practitioners of Light and healing magics, with an emphasis on doing no harm to others or the environment. They were sustenance hunters, and appeared to be nomadic, as Sindari tribal markings and identifiers have been found throughout the mainland. It is unknown at this time whether they had pointed ears, as they were not visible in the only illustration that has been recovered, but as early predecessors to modern Elvish species it can be safely assumed that they did. Interestingly, the most comprehensive record we have of Sindari currently is that of their written language, as speech was incorporated strongly into their spellcasting and the language was thus copied and recopied among millions of distinct dictionaries across Sindari culture.OverviewLifespan: Unknown, records indicate possible immortalityDiet: OmnivorousPreferred climate: Temperate broad-leaf forest\u00a0Magical Affinity: Presumed high, tending toward light and healing magicsAverage height: Fossil records indicate an average height of 181 cmAverage weight: Unkown, but fossils indicate light bones and wispy musculaturesIntelligence designation: SapientGovernmental structure: Nomadic, unknown leadership frameworkTechnological progression: Pre-IsranCurrent population and status: Presumed extinctDemographic range: Mid-Mainland, broad-leaf and pine forestsDwarvesStout, powerful folk who feel at home among rock and stone, although there are documented desert varieties as well.Blackfog DwarvesThe Dwarven Kingdoms of the Blackfog Mountains predate the Cataclysm, and their expansive underground cave cities are extremely well-preserved, though the same cannot be said of the Dwarves themselves. As a result, many records have been exhumed from the depths by daring explorers, and we have a decent understanding of what Blackfog Dwarven society was like. Their culture was radically different to that of human society, with everything from months to telling of time diverting from our norms, in large part due to the fact that they rarely saw sunlight. Every Dwarf is capable of growing a beard, male and female, and research suggests that the length of one's beard, as well as the number of distinct braids within it, was used as a status symbol. The Blackfog Dwarves commonly had large noses, distinct brow ridges, and, strong, stout, broad bodies. The most common hair colour among Dwarves was red and the most common eye colour was green, interestingly enough, though wild natural variations of hair and eye colour were noted as fairly common. Blackfog Dwarves had an obsession with metals of all kinds, and they were naturally proficient miners, digging out massive underground passageways in search of gold, platinum, silver, iron, mithril, copper, tin, and aluminium, all of which are common within the Blackfog Mountains. For sustenance, they ate ungol ichor, cave bear meat, giant undershroom flesh, deep crab meat, boar meat, and even dragon meat when available. It seems as if their bodies had evolved to drink stagnant water as well, with a very pronounced and developed toxin filtration system. This also allowed them to drink extremely strong alcohols, giving rise to the infamous Dwarven Ale, which, according to record, was considered a somewhat weak working man's drink. The Dwarven Kingdoms were, of course, led by a King, who had ultimate control over all state functions, although much of the day-to-day business was delegated to a council of advisors, whose word was as powerful to those of lower status as that of the King, though it could be overruled at the King's whim. Interestingly, artisans such as metalworkers and jewelers were considered the most respected of Dwarven society and made up the majority of its nobility, while undershroom farmers were considered the lowest class. Despite this, there was very little wealth disparity between the wealthiest noble and the poorest farmer, and Dwarven society necessitated respect between all fellow Dwarves on threat of exile. It has been theorised that this is due to the insular nature of their society and the constant threat from beasts and more unsavoury humanoids from deeper underground. More study is being done every day on this subspecies and this compendium will be updated as more is revealed.OverviewLifespan: 400-600 yearsDiet: Mostly carnivorousPreferred climate: Geothermally heated cavern systemsMagical Affinity: Middling, known for their runic enchantment systemAverage height: 137 cmAverage weight: 9-11 stone due to dense bones and musculatureIntelligence designation: SapientGovernmental structure: Absolute MonarchyTechnological progression: Post-IsraCurrent population and status: Unknown, thought to be less than 1,000 individuals remaining on the MainlandDemographic concentration: Blackfog MountainsGnomesDiminutive, cheery peoples with odd outlooks on life and often strange and alien societies.Vulcan GnomesSmall, hardy, and elusive, Vulcan Gnomes are a fairly newly discovered subspecies of gnome. This is partially due to the fact that Vulcan Gnomes tend to live in the extremely inhospitable conditions that make up the caldera of recently active volcanoes, and so very few humans have reported their existence. Until the appearance of a particular mercenary, who has given me the majority of information in this segment, Vulcan Gnomes were thought to be a myth stemming from the hallucinations of miners that had been underground for too long at at a time, or the delusions of climbers who scaled mountains too high to accommodate proper breathing. It was also thought for a long time that Vulcan Gnome sightings could be attributed to sightings of their close neighbors and distant cousins, Mountain Dwarves.Gnomes, however, are markedly different from Dwarves. Their flesh is usually a slightly green-tinged olive due to greenish, copper-based blood. They are proportioned similarly to humans, unlike the stouter and wider Dwarves, and tend to be less physically powerful. Dwarves -- and even many other gnome subtypes -- tend to have rounded ears, where Vulcan Gnomes have long, pointed ears. In addition, while Dwarves are not extraordinarily magically talented, Vulcan Gnomes are in fact completely magically inert. In the tests I conducted with my Vulcan volunteer, she displayed a remarkable resistance to the flow of mana, and in fact attempting to affect her directly with magical energies -- such as attempting to lift her with psionics or affect her mind with illusory magics -- ended in complete failure. Unfortunately, after some singed eyebrows, it was discovered that indirect magical effects, such as fireballs or lightning, are still completely effective.Despite their magical inertness, however, gnomes are some of the greatest -- if also the quirkiest -- enchanters in the known world. They have somehow discovered a way to infuse the inherent magic that surrounds their home cities into their written word, and so create enchanted engravings upon everything from strange tankards that allow one to drink magma like water to gloves that turn one's hands into climbing instruments. When pressed upon the extent of Gnomish innovation, however, my guest refused to speak of the secrets her people hold. Hopefully in the future I will be able to take a trip to their capital -- a city my guest calls Zfassbar -- and learn more about this strange an unique magical art.Vulcan Gnomes have some very unique internal physiological qualities, as well. Upon magical internal surveyal of my guest it was revealed to me that Vulcans have extremely pronounced lungs and a toxin filtration system quite similar to that of Blackfog Dwarves. This is likely a trait that became relevant over many generations to help these odd creatures breathe the awful sooty and superheated air that blasts their home cities constantly without dying. I hypothesize that this has the side-effect of making them similarly resistant to alcohol as Blackfog Dwarves, as my guest described Dwarven Ale as not particularly strong, whereas half a pint of the stuff is enough to make the average human blackout drunk. As discussed earlier, they have green, copper-based blood, the evolutionary reason for which is currently unclear. They tend to have light, yet hardy and nigh-unshatterable bones made from a hitherto undiscovered metallic substance, though unfortunately my guest would not allow me to take a sample.\u00a0My guest revealed little about Vulcan society, but I was able to glean that they are an circumstantially insular but cheery people on the whole, who welcome what few guests can brave their cities with careful cordiality, even if they keep the specifics of their technology as far away from outsiders as possible. Their cities are built almost entirely out of heavy metals such as steel, iron, copper, and bronze, and through unique supports are able to be built into the walls of the caldera itself should they be unable to build upon the summit due to magma floes. Each of their buildings is enchanted with an inexplicably strong magical barrier that prevents their homes from being utterly annihilated in the event of an eruption, which is another innovation which my guest was frustratingly unwilling to grant insight into. They are ruled by a High Council, which my guest tells me are usually made up of the greatest engineers and scientists of their age, and engineers and innovative minds are coveted above all others in Vulcan society, though smiths and other craftsmen are close in status. Their diet consists of mountain goat, undershroom flesh, and unspecified hearty crops they grow in the rich volcanic soil, though it is also possible for them to eat and digest igneous and sedimentary stone. All in all, the Vulcan Gnomes are an extremely interesting race of gnomes which warrant further study. This segment will be updated as more information is uncovered.OverviewLifespan: 700-900 yearsDiet: Omnivorous and saxivorousPreferred climate: Extremely hot -- 1,170 degrees Celsius\u00a0average -- and sooty, generally the caldera of recently active volcanoesMagical Affinity: InertAverage height: 97 cmAverage weight: 5\u00bd-7 stoneIntelligence designation: SapientGovernmental structure: Oligarchical CouncilTechnological progression: Post-IsraCurrent population and status: UnknownDemographic concentration: UnknownINCORPOREALSThis segment categorises all the non-humans which are not composed of matter, such as spirits, celestial beings, and chthonic beings. These are often the stuff of legend, but this segment will only feature those who are proven to exist.SpiritsThe definition of \"spirits\" is quite broad, covering everything from incorporeal guardians of nature to resurrected human spectres to wandering tormented souls. Thus, this category features a number of very different and very unique beings, and there may be very little in common between one spirit and another.Raven SpiritsDiscovered by Yuehuai Wu, submitted by her associate, \"Temptation Hotel\" owner Selene The Raven Spirits of the Eastern Lands are seen as spiritual guides by the common people of the Eastern Kingdoms, and revered as highly important religious figures. Thought to be children of the Raven Queen, the most sacred and beloved of Gods, they are ethereal beings, ephemeral and fleeting.They eat primarily meat, but enjoy legumes, nuts and the occasional leaf. Berries are delicacies, and their juices are intoxicating to the Raven Spirits. They write in a peculiar, simplistic and scratchy hieroglyphic script, and speak their own language -- called Ravenspeak -- consisting of rapid, lilting and fluid words and an emphasis on inflection. It is thought that some elements of Ravenspeak are higher in frequency than the human hearing range, and so human attempts to understand the language have been lacking. Most do not speak common, and thus they commune through a 'Speaker', who can understand Ravenspeak.They usually have familiars, highly revered by the spirits, which take the shape of foxes, children of the Fox Gods.OverviewLifespan: Unknown, records indicate probable immortalityDiet: OmnivorousPreferred climate: Adaptable, though suffer in arid climatesMagical Affinity: High, trend toward illusory and nature magicsAverage height: Irregular -- known specimens from 122 cm to 518 cmAverage weight: 8\u00bd stoneIntelligence designation: Post-SapientGovernmental structure: Tribal CouncilTechnological progression: Pre-Stone AgeCurrent population and status: Presumed approximately 10,000 individuals present in the wild, elusiveness makes exact population calculations difficultDemographic range: Temperate broad-leaf forests, mountains, and grassy plainsBESTIARYThis segment categorises all the non-sapient and non-sentient beasts of the world, from the smallest mouse to the mighty wyvern and everything in between.MammalsBeasts possessing a spinal column and the ability to regulate their own body temperature, usually also identified by secretion of milk by females to feed their young and live births rather than eggs.BuunvarDiscovered by Varan Heir Ralf Valgard, the White Wolf The Buunvar is a bovine native to Asgeir.  Large, strong, and hardy, these great beasts were integral to Varan history, and still hold cultural value to their people.  In ages past proto-Varan would hunt the Buunvar for their bones, hide, meat, and horns - all of which could be harvested for clothing, food, tools, and weapons.  Hunter-gatherers would follow herds of Buunvar across Asgeir, and opposing bands would often fight for control of valleys and tundras the Buunvar would inhabit; these types of conflicts continued even when the Varan settled down into static societies, as they were key to survival.Buunvar are naturally passive, but incredibly territorial and aggressive if provoked.  Killing them is no small task, usually requiring an entire hunting party.  In some cases, killing a Buunvar alone, or attempting to do so, was a rite of passage into manhood.Buunvar fur and hide is extremely resilient.  Traditionally, a father would slay a Buunvar for their pelt, and the mother would use it to craft a Ki'gar for the child.  They are near-impossible to tear or rip, do not tatter, and are resistant to fire.  It is said that the ancient Varan used whole cloaks of Buunvar hide to protect themselves against dragons breath, allowing them to slay the beasts.OverviewLifespan:  30-60 yearsDiet:  Herbivore (ruminant)Preferred climate:  Tundra, Plains, ValleysMagical Affinity:  NoneAverage height: 122-183 cmAverage weight: 107-179 stoneIntelligence designation:  Pre-sentientCurrent population and status:  Unknown, confined exclusively to Asgeir", "link_list": ["/user/3226", "/user/3123", "/user/451"], "image_list": ["https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/423174297410994186/512822931919863809/image0.jpg", "http://tolkiengateway.net/w/images/thumb/0/03/Marya_Filatova_-_Sinda.jpg/250px-Marya_Filatova_-_Sinda.jpg", "https://i.pinimg.com/originals/89/87/0f/89870f425f6fd9653df39a02fd27edf5.jpg", "http://i68.tinypic.com/or33q1.jpg", "https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/430273731508699137/513131745344880640/15424105303612159349414900064597.jpg", "http://i63.tinypic.com/4io5yq.jpg"], "html": "<font size=\"6\"><u><b>INTRODUCTION</b></u></font>"}, "post-87972": {"user": "Enigma", "user_num": 536, "timestamp": "1545940804000", "message": "Nice", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Nice"}}
