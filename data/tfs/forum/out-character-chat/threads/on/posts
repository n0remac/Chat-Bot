Primarily because in theory it impact everyone currently playing a demon, and anyone thinking about making a demon.The threads this storyline occupy's thus far are:ABYSSAL ACQUISITIONS.DEMON REALM: BASACIAL'S MANSION.THE DEMONIC REALMS (HELLSCAPE)First a brief summary of what Basacial is. Basacial is what is referred to as a mutt, a demonic cross breed. Most demons fall solely into a single category of the seven deadly sins. Basacial has blood from four different varieties of demons in his veins. Many demon's in hell consider his status as a crossbreed as an offense, that he is less than them because he isn't a pure blood. Basacial has made it his life's mission to make those who have that view pay. He graduated at the top of his class at demon school, and became a contract demon. He became renowned across hell for never failing to uphold a contract, and is known as the most honest demon in hell. Part of the reason for his success is his employment of mortal business tactics. He has turned much of hell from it's former anarchistic ways, to a more capitalist society. This has had the by product of also making him the richest demon in hell. He is well loved in the circle of greed as instead of hording wealth, he creates it, following the old axiom: You have to spend money, to make money. With that out of the way I will try and be brief in my summary of recent events. As a contract demon, Basacial makes deals. He cut a deal with Fol-lu, Skywarden, where Fol-lu would retrieve an item known as The Mourning Star, in exchange for the location of a different item. The Mourning Star was kept in [DEAD] Demonlord Lavish's palace in the Circle of Pride. Fol-lu was successful Basacial received The Mourning Star, and using his unique ability to consume demonic artifacts, he took it into his being. This granted the deal maker a significant power boost.Lavish of course was enraged that the artifact had been stolen, and traveled to Basacial's mansion to retrieve it. Lavish was far over matched even in ideal circumstances, and within the deal makers home he proved to be no threat to Basacial. With the Demonlord of Pride completely at his mercy, he gave him a choice: serve or die. Lavish chose to die, and thus Basacial killed his first Demonlord. The very next morning after killing Lavish, Basacial faced off against The Demonlord of Greed Shax. Basacial had humiliated Shax by winning the demonlord's mansion in a game of cards. Shax agreed to make Basacial his successor if the deal maker agreed to a duel to the death. The results where predictable, and Basacial took the title of Demonlord of Greed from Shax's corpse. The utter domination off two Demonlords in two days, is wildly regarded as the most impressive feat to have been performed in millennium. Basacial is the undisputed darling of the Circle of Greed. He proved that he is one of the most powerful combatants in hell, and he is likely the greatest political power as well.That is the story thus far.", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1223/abyssal-acquisitions", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1240/demon-realm-basacials-mansion?page=1&scrollTo=26914", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/710/demonic-realms-hellscape?page=4&scrollTo=26835", "/user/1073", "/user/1102"], "image_list": [], "html": "I will summarize Basacial's story line thus far here.
