Holy Magic done by priests is OK. Arcane magic by wizards, etc. are accepted depending on the reputation and allies of the person practicing it.Dragons are rare and generally thought to be evil (and must be destroyed!)Lots of superstition about the Fae and other magical / supernatural creatures.The usual sort of society challenges that help make for conflict and friction for which stories can thrive. I don't really have any more thought or planned out, because I first wanted to see if anyone would even be more willing to \"deal\" with a more traditional medieval atmosphere.I would also like the area to be more \"sandbox\" as well in that the players wouldn't have to \"ask\" before jumping or joining other scenes (but their characters would, of course, have to bear the consequences of it), but I also know that most people prefer not to be bothered when they're in a scene.Anyway!
