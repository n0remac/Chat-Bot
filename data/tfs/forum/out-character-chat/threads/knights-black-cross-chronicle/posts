achievements, and end goal of the Brotherhood.\u00a0 The reader's goal should be to indulge themselves in the knowledge found within these pages.\u00a0 To properly record the chronicle of the Knight Brothers, the author must explain the origin of their belief: Angelism; the author also intends to explain the nature of their conquests, which are often construed as sacrilegious.Part I:\u00a0 AngelismMany years ago when the Divine One still walked this world as a mortal he was known as Saint John.\u00a0 John's full name and origin cannot be identified, for he did not record his life before turning to Angelism.\u00a0 John's original profession involved medicine and surgery, acting as a doctor.\u00a0 It was during his time that the Cataclysm struck the world.\u00a0 Famine, plague, and harsh conditions beset the world; Despair reigned and Hope became diminished.\u00a0 Hope is the sole intangible force which can drive away Despair.The Old World crumbled into anarchy and John saw this.\u00a0 He set out to find the answers, for he questioned why the Angels in Heaven would abandon them, why Hope would give away to Despair.\u00a0 Wherever he traveled he found those in need.\u00a0 The people were sick, hungry, thirsty, tired, and lost.\u00a0 He healed them, fed them, gave them water and rest, and guided them.\u00a0 The people put their faith in him, for they believed he alone could lead the world out of the darkness of the Cataclysm.\u00a0 But John was a humble man, and after doing all that he could, he set out to find the answers he sought.There was no priest, no mage, and no seer in the world who could offer him what he wanted.\u00a0 They spoke of Fiery Hells, Fallen Angels, and Corruption, but never offered a way to find Hope.\u00a0 And as he continued his journey he found more people in need.\u00a0 Once more, he helped them, for he knew if he was in need he'd wish to be helped too.And then there came the day when John's word and very person become the embodiment of Hope.\u00a0 He underwent a sense of realization and transcendence.\u00a0 It was he who gave the people Hope, and he alone who gave them purpose to live.\u00a0 When he came to this conclusion he recorded all his morals, life experiences, and teachings.\u00a0 His followers came to call this book the Scripture.\u00a0 John was venerated as Saint John, Bringer of Hope and Vanquisher of Despair.\u00a0 His flock grew and he became its shepherd, but he still made enemies.In his final days, as he finished the Scripture, John set out with his Disciplines to find a suitable homeland for his people.\u00a0 While besieged atop a mountain by his enemies, John and his greatest warriors, known as the Brothers, from which the Brotherhood took its name, stayed behind to hold off the enemy.\u00a0 The Brothers all died as martyrs, and Saint John himself was taken to the camp of his enemies, wherein he was burned before his people upon a cross; that which was left was a black cross.\u00a0 Saint John's soul ascended to the Heavens to join the Angels, and there he has become venerated as the Most Holy, our Lord and the Divine One.When news of his death and ascension spread, his enemies found themselves beset on all sides by friends of the Most Holy.\u00a0 They smote them and pursued all who would oppose his people to the ends of the earth.\u00a0 His morals, teachings, and life experiences recorded in the Scripture, and the unity that he inspired in his people allowed the world to claw itself out of the cold grave of Despair, giving way to the Light of the Present.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><i><font size=\"2\"><font size=\"5\"><b>Knights of the Black Cross</b></font></font></i><br/></div>"}, "post-60335":

Rebellions.\u00a0 In a corner of the Vessian Empire, blessed be the Emperor who rules there, there came to be a contested territory known as Swavia.\u00a0 Rich not only in its history, but also in its resources and arable farmland, it became an integral part of any nation which wished to rule the region, but it was always a core part of the Imperial citizens.\u00a0 In a terrible conflict many decades ago, the Empire was able to exert its power and dominion over the area.\u00a0 Of course, that particular conflict ended in a treaty, and not outright victory.\u00a0 The Imperials were forced to install a vassal family there: the House of Swavia.The Swavians were a proud, arrogant, and wealthy bunch, and it became obvious early on they would not abide by the law of our Emperor, but rather by laws of their own.\u00a0 Despite this, the Empire still gorged itself on the advantages the region offered for many years.And then came the Rebellions.\u00a0 The Swavians became overly proud, thinking themselves superior to Imperial law and sought independence.\u00a0 The Emperor might have allowed them such independence, so long as they contained themselves in their traditional territories.\u00a0 But the Swavians, greedy as they were, reached out and annexed more land which was not rightfully theirs.\u00a0 The Emperor saw this as an act of war, but against the wishes of his lords, barons, and vassals, he refused to raise arms.\u00a0 The Swavians soon encountered resistance to their laws and edicts, for the Vessians who lived in the annexed towns and cities wished to swear allegiance to the Empire, not the Swavians.\u00a0 They responded to Vessian protests by slaughtering them.\u00a0 At first dozens of Vessians were killed in cold blood, and then hundreds, reaching the thousands.Angered at this, the Emperor called upon all his subjects to wage war on the villains.\u00a0 Knights and peasants, men-at-arms, and even the Church came to aid the Emperor in his hour of need.\u00a0 The Swavians on the other hand sought powerful allies who mobilized against the Imperials.\u00a0 What followed was the Swavian Rebellions.Initial Vessian forays into Swavia were successful, but they soon ground into a stalemate when the front lines were reinforced with Swavia's newfound allies.\u00a0 Very slowly the Vessians pushed on, but for every victory they found a defeat.\u00a0 Many proud knights and nobles were killed at the hands of former countrymen, and the Empire itself started to crumble.\u00a0 Counts, lords, barons, and vassals turned against one another and power struggles in the Empire ran rampant.\u00a0 In the waning years of the Rebellions however, the Vessian Loyalists laid siege to the remaining castles in Swavia, tore down the gates, and put to the sword every Swavian who yet lived.The country was soaked in the blood of every contender, and after the Rebellions small skirmishes throughout the Empire lasted for some months until the balance
