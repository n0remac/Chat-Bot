{"post-67117": {"user": "Empress Naoki", "user_num": 607, "timestamp": "1495157358000", "message": "Back in March, I asked for your opinions, though TFS Survey #1. Until recently, it has been open for responses, but now it is closed, and I will share the results. The manner in which I constructed the survey has the answers laid out in some pretty awkward ways. For example, the first question, \u201cHow many characters do you have in total?\u201d was a text response question. As such, the answers are presented through Google Surveys like this.The same goes for most of the questions, simply due to my inexperience with the Google Surveys platform and lack of thought put into this portion of the process, and how the data would be displayed and such. I\u2019m wiser for it, but the data is still messy. As such, I\u2019m going to be summarizing some of the results with my words.A few quick things to note before I begin, as context.There were 14 responses to the survey.There were 17 questions on the survey.The last response was collected on March 21st. Since then, TFS has changed quite a bit, and many of these replies, especially toward the end, are outdated. Consider this \u201ca look at March,\u201d rather than \u201cwhat people think right now,\u201d because this data is not current.Question #1: How many characters do you have in total?20ishHella125-302Less than five, not sure how many specifically29342, but I plan to make at least 2 more87More than 1018About 159The results here aren\u2019t particularly compelling; I don\u2019t think. I put the question down as the first question because it seemed easy, and expected the results to be more impressive than they were. If I enumerate the text responses, order them ascending, and then put them in a scatter chart real quick, we get this. And we can see that the \u201cstandard\u201d range for characters goes up to about 30, and some people have an awful lot more than that, to the tone of \u201c87,\u201d and \u201cHella.\u201dQuestion #2: How many of those characters do you play on a semi-regular basis?Responses varied here but were almost all small numbers. I made the text responses into numbers, and ten of the responses were less than five. Four said five or above. Two respondents stated that they only play one character actively. 3-4351035One regularly, the rest sporadically2Few ;_; 12-410-1522It\u2019s interesting but unsurprising to see that the usual number of characters a player plays actively is quite small, while the number of characters that players have is perhaps somewhere around twenty.Question #3: How often do you make new characters?I\u2019ve modified the given chart to be displayed more clearly, with the full answers right next to the corresponding parts of the pie, and with the number of responses underneath. Question #4: Who or what is your favorite character?Ignoring those responses who declined to answer the question, the responses are as follows. Empress Naoki Anyone BUT Royal Fletcher \u201cThe Vikings,\u201d referring to the group Systkin RagnarokGrandma Tommy Lady Genevieve St. James Royal Fletcher The Misty Woods Neva-Svir-Suna, Wavewarden Empress Naoki This is another wholly unsurprising result. I, Madame Naoki, am undeniably TFS\u2019 Favorite Character by a wide margin.   I didn\u2019t expect any real information out of this, but it\u2019s interesting to see regardless. I\u2019m going to follow this up in the next survey with, \u201cWhat traits do you like to see in other players\u2019 characters?\u201dQuestion #5: Do you consider TFS more of a 'writing' thing or more of a 'game' thing?I asked this question, as TFS is often termed as a \u201cwriting game\u201d or something along those lines, and I wanted to see what people thought. Question #6: Do you think that there should be more...(Multiple responses were allowed for this question.)Question #7: Do you think that there should be a larger variety of open settings for characters to use on TFS?Some of the \u201cOther\u201d responses are as follows. Fine as is.I think there are plenty, pretty much just make them as they're needed.Whatever people have fun doing!Question #8: Do you create quests/content/settings for other players?Question #9: How much would you consider yourself (the player) to be part of a group or government on TFS?This question, I asked to see how much of a sense of \u2018belonging\u2019 players had to a faction. It wasn\u2019t worded very well, and I don\u2019t think this was an excellent way to collect the information, in hindsight.Question #10: Do you think that there is enough variation, theme-wise, in the currently active groups and governments?Some of the \u201cOther\u201d responses are as follows:Yes if certain nations would actually do stuff.I guess?I have no idea.Question #11: How much would you be interested (generally speaking) in taking part in a tournament style event?I put this question on the survey in an attempt to gauge how interested TFS might be in another Tournament like the last one I put on. Responses varied, but seem pretty good. Question #12: How difficult is it for you (the player) to find a good scene to take part in?Here, and for all of the other 1-5 spectrum questions so far, I realize I\u2019ve forgotten to specify which end of the spectrum is which. I intend, and I feel as if it is logical to assume that in this case, \u201c1\u201d means, \u201cNot difficult at all\u201d and \u201c5\u201d means \u201cVery difficult,\u201d but I ought to have said as much outright.Question #13: How many of your scenes do you set up with another player Out-Of-Character?It seems as if none of the survey respondents think that they set up all of their scenes out-of-character, and I might be inclined to question that, personally, but the data does imply that a very significant portion of scenes on TFS are indeed set up in such a manner.Question #14: What sort of RP are you most interested in?For this question, in the interest of expediency, I\u2019m going to simply paste the results right here with a few grammatical edits.Slice of life, 1v1 (ish) combat, and just about anything else that seems fun at the timeBizarre AdventureIt depends on the mood, hence why I make a number of characters to fill in those little plots I take an interest in - from slice of life and romance, to something more battle hardened.Quality scenes, could be anything as long as it's good.Inter-related, stories of different people coming together.Political and Grand QuestMore wandering around/slice of life/general exploration and character developmentPolitical (especially long-term political), romance is always fun, just basic day-to-day life. All sorts, really.Pretty much all of itRomance + QuestingAdventure, political, sword and sandal, epic journeysCharacter-focused role playing, or plots relying heavily on character-to-character interaction and development.Combatz or epic long quests or plots that span a long time and leave history after it is over.Question #15: What sort of RP would you like to be able to do on TFS, but cannot?Again, here are the responses, with minor edits and the non-responses removed.More fast-paced/rapid-fire rp. People are usually busy though and I lose interest rather quickly most of the time.I'd like more horror-mystery style RP, but there isn't much of that on TFSCasual interactions - possibly more my own fault and the fault of my character's personality than anything.Small-scale war. The biggest nations are all friends.Longer and bigger quests, the kind that generates a sense of history or events in TFS. Ex: the Gems quest, as it could still be considered to be going on still.Political intrigue. Not many are into it, so it's few and far between.Political IntrigueInnovation and darker themes (a better style of evil)Other eras, but that is understandableQuestion #16: What do you think is the biggest problem on TFS right now?(Keep in mind, these responses are from March.)Not enough taco-based content. That @badger guy really knows his way around a taco.Lack of activity/dispersed activity that is not concentrated enough.Lack of interaction between governments?I think the problems are starting to work themselves out for the most part. Still, there are some dead nations laying around that need to go IMO.Over-reliance upon certain people to continue plots, making their hiatuses awfully detrimental.Lack of proper nations besides IsraLack of well-rounded villains, lack of open countries, lack of macro-conflict.Lack of diverse activity, and what it mostly around is a scene already set by a number of people engaging in some story, so it's really off limits to a new individual.Not enough people in the chat roomThere is a clique of people that just want to be isolated from all others. Sure, that's their prerogative, and you can't tell people to change how they want to play, but this is also supposed to be a sandbox where people can join in. There is an attitude where if someone new wants to join in on a setting they made that they must be there to fuck everything up and they should be made to feel as unwelcome as possible.It\u2019s my opinion that in the time between the time this survey was taken, and now, some of these issues have been resolved quite satisfactorily. Some of these concerns are still quite valid, and worth seriously considering as we move forward into the middle of the year.The last question asked if the survey respondents would participate in another study, and none of them said no. (I\u2019m not going to put another image in here.)So. With all of that in mind and the understanding between us being that I have indeed shared the results of that survey as I said I would, I\u2019ll go ahead and invite comments on the survey, and discussion about the results. Good feedback and rational discourse are both swell. If you have any questions or any of that, have at it.And then I\u2019ll go on to ask the following: Do you have any ideas for questions to be put on TFS Survey #2? If so, go ahead and share them, and I may end up putting them on there.", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/2451/tfs-survey-1", "http://i.imgur.com/kKs4u9G.png", "http://i.imgur.com/6LsHPcs.png", "http://i.imgur.com/NF8FIg6.png", "/user/607", "/user/323", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/2399/systkin-ragnarok", "/user/602", "/user/1235", "/user/875", "/user/323", "/user/49", "/user/1538", "/user/607", "http://i.imgur.com/CqdEkYq.png", "http://i.imgur.com/iJgiLsK.png", "http://i.imgur.com/zXC7YM7.png", "http://i.imgur.com/sMIUBvJ.png", "http://i.imgur.com/TPSXpVI.png", "http://i.imgur.com/yf7HTez.png", "http://i.imgur.com/HolSFmc.png", "http://i.imgur.com/rKot8xI.png"], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/kKs4u9G.png", "http://i.imgur.com/6LsHPcs.png", "http://i.imgur.com/NF8FIg6.png", "//storage.proboards.com/6046952/images/Wbr3iwq2NLu64X4comSt.png", "http://i.imgur.com/CqdEkYq.png", "http://i.imgur.com/iJgiLsK.png", "http://i.imgur.com/zXC7YM7.png", "http://i.imgur.com/sMIUBvJ.png", "http://i.imgur.com/TPSXpVI.png", "http://i.imgur.com/yf7HTez.png", "http://i.imgur.com/SgJwvna.png", "http://i.imgur.com/HolSFmc.png", "http://i.imgur.com/rKot8xI.png"], "html": "Back in March, I asked for your opinions, though "}, "post-67217": {"user": "Badger", "user_num": 2100, "timestamp": "1495187470000", "message": "I would like some question asked about the possibility of more taco-based content!   ... sorry Also I'm inclined to think the 1-5 scales were generally understood, and I am perfectly willing to believe no one plans EVERY SINGLE scene\u00a0all of their characters\u00a0enter into.

The most important things the community needs to work on, imo, is the diversity of content and inaccessibility for new players. Both these aspects seem to have gotten better recently. That final clique comment was worrying. It does seem that the majority of active players seem to have allied with Isra. Some contention between the political factions of Isra could help generate new content. New players who have trouble jumping into the Open Lands will naturally seek out the large government. Governments should offer some sort of inner faction driven gameplay. This could be accomplished with more quests. Less time consuming, but more initial work would be a restructure of alliances or goals.  For example: The Free City and Black tower could be competing, Isra and Gualdin could have unfair trade agreements, creating new inner governmental groups that subdivide existing execuative power.Lastly, the quest board has been looking kinda slim. I am trying to get a big quest going which will eventually relate to the rest of the Overworld. More easy and less time-consuming quests would be good. I am very excited for the upcoming tower.All that said, I think many of the issues I discussed are in being fixed. This information will definitely help me with my future playing. The \"gamers vs the writers\" was particularly interesting to me. For the next survey, I would be interested in knowing some demographics of where players play.

The. Fuck.#4.This was rigged.On a serious note, I do wish this question received more answers to make the results more accurate. I think this can't really be used as an actual judgement to who is the \u201cmost favorite character\u201d unless it hopefully receives more results.#7I personally answered \u201cNo.\u201d on this, but I believe I misunderstood the question at the time.Should there be more scenes and settings? No.Should there be more variety in scenes and settings? Yes, as in different atmospheres and genres and moods.#8For 11 votes, there sure aren't that many quests on the board... (In March and early May, at least.)#10I do think there is enough variation of theme in groups and governments, but I do believe we have too many nations per active character. This \u201cnation:character\u201d ratio has seemingly been moving, as more people who are not fully ready or prepared to participate in or manage a government (or group) have created these groups with good initial support, but then slowly begin to die and stagnate.Some of the current nations either need some more attention, or should be removed. (Perhaps temporarily.)#11I wasn't interested myself, but I do think the last tournament went fairly well, excluding a few arguments and snags, but those were kind of expected. However, near the end of the last tournament, it seemed to lose most of its attention, probably due to slow delays, or perhaps because it became dull? #14It seems Political and Grand Questing types of RP are those most requested. Although Grand Quests are usually much harder to make, manage, and keep interesting.  But when it is good, damn son, it's fun.#15I'd like to also see more small scale war, and darker themes, as there is apparently a lack of them on TFS.\u201cOther eras,\u201d as in like different time periods but with the same rules as TFS? (That's what I'm assuming.)#16I have to agree with the \u201cLack of diverse activity,\u201d \u201cLack of people in chat,\u201d and \u201cclique\u201d responses. I personally usually have troubles in general joining new communities and RPs, and I think we ought to try and come together in chat or whatever to help welcome and guide new players, together. When we help these \u201cnewbs\u201d together, as a friendly community, it helps them feel much more welcome and much better about themselves. We also strengthen our bonds between each member of TFS when we cooperate to greet and assist any newcomers. As (mostly) mature members of this community, we should not be afraid to politely speak up (preferably in a PM) when we have a problem with someone's actions OOCly or ICly, whether the player is new or old. Public chat should not be a place for possibly controversial or character threatening (or even non-threatening) disagreements.While we're on this topic, if somebody is trying to help a new person in chat, PLEASE STOP TALKING, as the new player will be awfully confused and may miss what the person helping them may have said. And the reason why the person assisting shouldn't just \u201ctake it to PMs\u201d is because the chat (IMO) is much easier to use, is user friendly, accessible on page of TFS, and the new guy may not yet know where to find or how to use the PMs.That'll be it.I do think Silas\u2019 question on \u201cwhat state/providence/country/time-zone/continent do you live in?\u201d would be a nice one to add.Cheers.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/2F8u6S9.jpg?1"], "html": "I just wanna personally look at and self-reflect a bit on the results and analyze some of these results."}, "post-70265": {"user": "Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui", "user_num": 102, "timestamp": "1499396437000", "message": "Que?Where is number 2?I've been gone, who knows how long, and there still isn't a 2nd survey yet?", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["//storage.proboards.com/6046952/images/E7rqAlVALSIkh8FZsiDD.png"], "html": "Que?"}}
