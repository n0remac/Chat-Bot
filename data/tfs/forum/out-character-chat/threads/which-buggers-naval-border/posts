All thoughts relating to how  Dolburrim\u00a0sits in relation to other nations on a map came after\u00a0it was already on the board. I'll admit, I ought to have moved it after the map came out, but the thought didn't cross my mind. To advocate taking the word of the board over the word of the leader of the nation is, in my own humble opinion, bad practice. It's much easier for the board to be inaccurate- it's only a rough listing of north to south, not all at definite or impeccably accurate.
