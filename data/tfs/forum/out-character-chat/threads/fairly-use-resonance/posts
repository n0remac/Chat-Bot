Right now the owners are me and\u00a0Konan  .So, just to give an idea of how strong this thing is, here is an excerpt from Resonance's bio:\"Resonance is an artifact of near godly power. The blade is so keen it can cut anything, the sword is completely indestructible, and it can safely magnify the force of a blow a hundred fold. A single swing from Resonance can level a building, or send out a shock wave that shatters the ground a hundred feet around. Resonance can also magnify and increase the power of spells channeled through it, safely increasing power by ten fold. When magnifying power Resonance is capable of greater multiplication than stated here. These however are the safety thresholds for any normal person wielding it. \"Resonance is also a fourth dimensional construct, and as such posses time sight. With time sight the blade is capable of warning its wielder of incoming danger, and even move of its own accord to block. \"Finally Resonance is capable of casting a few select spells of its own accord. It can create shields, teleport itself and its wielder, cast energy waves of immense power, has limited telekinetic powers and it can share visions of the future. In addition it chooses it's own wielder, and if it decides it doesn't like it's wielder it will leave of it's own accord.\"Now I think the idea behind Resonance is that the owner of the character,\u00a0Alden Marshal    , would determine how we use the sword. But I was thinking maybe we should lay some ground rules in case he's not around.Here's how I think the weapon should be used, but I'm open to suggestions.1. Since Resonance is a celestial fairy (with the mentality of a five year old), it can only be used to attack overtly dangerous and evil threats, or if someone's life is in danger. It can kill an offensive dragon, but can't be used to conquer an empire (unless it's an evil empire, whatever that means).2. It has to be regularly appeased, with snacks, funny stories, play, etc.3. Since it is its own being, it must have its own \"mana pool\" (the rule says that all magic comes from the same source, so fourth dimensional magic is still magic). This means there are limits to its power:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a. It can use its x100 power strikes as long as it has mana, but when it runs out, it enters base form.\u00a0 \u00a0 b. Its\u00a0shock-wave-inducing, building destroying, earth-shattering swings cost 10% of its mana.\u00a0 \u00a0 c. Its spell magnifying ability has a variable cost, but very powerful spells, amplified, would cost 30% of\u00a0its mana.\u00a0 \u00a0 d. Its ability to sense danger is like \"spidey sense\", it only works a few seconds forward.4. Resonance's powers are subject to anti-magic, though its base form remains intact. In base form, it is still indestructible and razor sharp and can still warn the wielder of incoming danger.Anyways, what do you guys think?", "link_list": ["/user/1042", "/user/1039", "/user/794"], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/UqeNedz.png"], "html": "So, we have a new god-like weapon in game,\u00a0"}, "post-23618": {"user": null, "user_num": null, "timestamp": "1455314666000", "message": "I think something this insanely powerful shouldn't even be here, but the ground rules work well enough.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "I think something this insanely powerful shouldn't even be here, but the ground rules work well enough."}, "post-23620": {"user": "Konan", "user_num": 1039, "timestamp": "1455314942000", "message": "I think these ground rules sound reasonable.

Let me try adjusting it a little further:1. Since Resonance is a celestial fairy (with the mentality of a five year old), it can only be used to attack overtly dangerous and evil threats, or if someone's life is in danger. It can kill an offensive dragon, but can't be used to conquer an empire (unless it's an evil empire, whatever that means).2. It has to be regularly appeased, with snacks, funny stories, play, etc.3.

Its shock-wave-inducing, building destroying, earth-shattering swings cost 10%\u00a01/6th of its mana.    c. Its spell magnifying ability has a variable cost, but very powerful spells, amplified, would cost 30%\u00a01/2 of its mana.    d. Its ability to sense danger is like \"spidey sense\", it only works a few seconds forward. A warning costs 1/6th of its mana.4. Resonance's powers are subject to anti-magic, though its base form remains intact. In base form, it is still indestructible and razor sharp and can still warn the wielder of incoming danger.5. It's cutting power is still dependent on the strength of the wielder. It can THEORETICALLY cut through anything, but the wielder must have the physical strength to do so. In the hands of a child it couldn't cut a tree branch.So basically the weapon would work like this. The wielder has to be in a life-threatening situation or fighting a dangerous or evil foe or Resonance will not work at all. It will become invisible/intangible to the user. (The user may want to consider having a secondary weapon in case Resonance decides to peace out).Let's say it has six charges of mana. A powerful, god-like swing costs one charge. A premonition of an attack costs one charge. Charging a spell up to terrifying extremes costs three charges. If the user cannot use their own magic, the sword may cast its own spells, but these also cost one charge\u00a0each (telekinesis, shield, holy beam attack).And again, the user has to maintain a \"friendship\" with the weapon to use its power. This means regularly acknowledging in IC. The user also has to maintain a positive alignment.@\u00a0Jill I do agree, which is why I decided to bring it up before it caused any arguments. I don't wanna invalidate the quest line it took to get the sword, which took several days and was life-threatening, but I don't wanna start arguments over the weapon's insane power. That's why I'm trying to reach power levels that everyone can agree with.Keep in mind that Resonance is unusable in friendly competition.", "link_list": ["/user/111"], "image_list": [], "html": "@ @medsy "}, "post-23628": {"user": "Moonflower L\u00e0idir", "user_num": 1010, "timestamp": "1455320023000", "message": "I just said this in chat, but I figured I'd post here for posterity.The last bit of restrictions seems mostly reasonable, although I'm of the opinion of some of the others that this item shouldn't even be in existence lol.

For instance, Maelik is supposedly an evil being, but if he's not hurting anyone, then Resonance shouldn't be able to harm him. Arya is a holy paladin, but if for some reason she is killing innocent people, then Resonance could be used.There's also the fact that more powerful characters than this already exist, like Gravlor and Fundor. Arguably, if they decided to just go ahead and attack an innocent farmland or something, Jun could use Resonance to block their most powerful attacks with a super-charged spell, then make exactly one counter-attack with another super-charged spell before Resonance runs out of power.So that's another way of looking at it.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "I could kinda argue it's actually an anti-OP weapon.

His son who he wiped out of existence.\" - Alden in chatThis just makes me wanna get this right even more. =[Ok, here's my second draft for the weapon:Resonance should have a base form and a celestial form. In base form, it is simply a shiny, very sharp invincible sword. In celestial form it becomes an extremely powerful holy artifact.Here are conditions for using the weapon's celestial form.1. It can only be used defensively in life-threatening situations.2. If used offensively, the foe must be a threat to the welfare of those positively aligned or close to the user.3. It cannot kill a foe (it leaves them with one HP, so to speak).4. It must be consistently be acknowledged as having been played with/appeased (as a child would be).5. The user must maintain a positive alignment.Assuming a mana pool of 100, here are its celestial form powers:1. Heavenly Strike, 10 mana, magnifies the impact of a standard swing x 100. (In Jun and Konan's case, this would mean turning a standard, everyday 50 newton swing into a 5,000 newton swing which could disarm a heavily armored knight and knocking them back several meters). No more house-exploding attacks, but more strikes.2. Future Sight, 10 mana, prevents ambushes by giving the user a few extra seconds to respond. No infinite dodges.3. Spells: Telekinesis, Holy Energy Beam, Force Shield, 20 mana each. Only 5 spells total, depending on how the weapon is used.4. Auto-Block, 20 mana, can self-animate to deflect a blow with a Heavenly Strike. No infinite blocks.5. Spell Augmentation, 10-100 mana, can magnify a spell's power by 100% x every 10 mana used.\u00a0However, the user loses the requisite mana required to normally cast the spell at that magnitude.\u00a0This one is for\u00a0@medsy   . The user gets limited, maybe even only one chance to finish off the villain with an extremely powerful spell, and if it fails the user will be substantially weakened or even powerless.Here's a question for\u00a0Konan    and Resonance. Do you think this is too weak?", "link_list": ["/user/1039"], "image_list": [], "html": "UPDATE: \"Also Jun Resonance isn't a celestial fairy he is a fourth dimensional spell construct given a rudimentary personality based on memories of a five year old child.

In response to the thread's title, I dunno if there's a fair way to use this because even if god items are nerfed until deemed technically \"fair,\" it's still contributing to the arms race mentality we try to avoid, which always contributes to unfair situations.I'll tell you right now, if my character were on the evil side of the alignment scale, I would have a huge problem with this. Particularly in a community where evil characters would tend to receive more backlash for possessing equally powerful items or abilities.On a technical level: I am having a little trouble wrapping my head around \"future sight\" and how that's even enforceable, much less legally enforceable?On a thematic level: we don't want to promote a game that emphasizes some sort of level\u00a0in a matter similar to Final Fantasy.
