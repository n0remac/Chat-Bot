Basically, a new setting is created using a faction, say the Brotherhood.  In this setting, the Brotherhood only owns 1 castle.  Maybe 2-3 other sub-boards exist, but these are owned by an NPC called the Sultanate, the enemies of the Brotherhood.  Players who come here can join the Brotherhood and fight in simulated battles, commanding small armies, and conquer territory from the Sultanate.  Imagine playing as a character fighting some random enemies; now imagine playing as a character in the middle of a battle leading other soldiers against some random enemies.  I'll be playing the enemy faction like a GM would be playing the enemies in a normal RP.  Successfully conquering regions (sub-boards) will allow that player to be the 'leader' of that domain.EDIT:\u00a0 So in other words, you come to that setting with your army, or speak to someone who will give you some troops, and go into a battle thread to fight the sultanate.\u00a0 I'll present real challenges and outcomes for you.\u00a0 Winning these battles liberates areas, and when the whole region is liberated it may become a new state.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "I won't go into detail now since it is irrelevant, but some of you were not getting idea I had in mind (my fault, as I did most of this on my phone anyhow and did not quite explain it as well as I should have)."}}
