Growth and activity have been on track with my projection for the first year and we are now moving into year two. Our first year split focus between development and a slow, controlled growth. Our second year is going to shift priority to growing the community, and so I hope to see faster growth this next year than the last.The Fantasy Sandbox is still a very new project. I'd like to thank you all for the time you've put into this game and the patience you've had for the diversity of its content and contributors. I'd like to remind you that the entire game world and all of its content is your own, incredible creation.
