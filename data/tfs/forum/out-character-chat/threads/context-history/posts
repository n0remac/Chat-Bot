I don\u2019t now know why I thought this was a good idea at the time, but let\u2019s pretend that I read it in hopes that it would create an over-arching narrative of that character\u2019s life. It did, but of course this meant I only had that one character\u2019s part of the story, which ultimately was not a problem as I could just fill in the gaps and dialogue in the story for myself, in my head.I would like to chronicle\u00a0this character\u2019s life story by sharing with you handsome and sweet-smelling people:  No Context History!*IMPORTANT NOTE*:The following is what I believe to be a 100% accurate account of the character\u2019s life story, as I am not in direct possession of any evidence to the contrary. Also I may do this again at some point so if you have a suggestion for a character\u2019s history I should read without context please let me know.Thanks!-Badger", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Hello and happy Taco Tuesday! to all you wonderful denizens of TFS, otherwise known as Taco Free Saturday."}, "post-60895": {"user": "Badger", "user_num": 2100, "timestamp": "1488549567000", "message": "Nakatani: Sexy Naked Shoulder and Why Tea Parties are AwesomeNakatani\u2019s (here after called \u201cNaka\u201d) history is a wonderful and storied tale of romance, infected arrow wounds, and drug-fueled tea parties. I would like to digress for just a moment and say that I really liked the use of tea drinking in this history, as it gives the reader somewhere safe and comfortable to return to between bad shit happening. If Naka is quietly drinking tea, the odds are things are alright for the moment, and you can just enjoy the description of fragrant warm tea drinking.Naka was basically purchased by some guy or another from a second guy that Naka owed money to and was trying to pay back. There was a lot of bowing and stuff in reference to this first guy so he seems king-shit-important until you figure out that there\u2019s bowing all the time, so maybe he\u2019s important maybe he\u2019s not. Doesn\u2019t matter because he\u2019s not in the story for long.The person that is important isn\u2019t in the story until Naka goes off to King Shit\u2019s house to start working to pay him off (seems like a bad deal, but alright fine); the important guy has a name but I don\u2019t remember it, so we\u2019ll call him Samurai Boyfriend. That name isn\u2019t ironic, he\u2019s an actual no kidding around samurai. Because.. east Asia.At any rate, Naka and Samurai Boyfriend are drinking LOADS of awesome tea and getting acquainted over a board game when some jackwagon named Rolland (or something) shoots Samurai Boyfriend in the shoulder. Naka runs away but is captured by Rolland trying to hide because she knocks over this extremely badly placed pot/vase type of thing. Anyway Rolland drags the wounded Samurai Boyfriend into the room and is just about to kill Naka in front of him (told you he\u2019s a jackwagon) when Samurai Boyfriend breaks out his sick ass beat-boxing skills and Rolland decides to let her go. Rolland isn\u2019t in the story anymore after this, which brought me to the conclusion that those were some sick ass beats.Naka feels bad because she thinks its a little bit her fault he took an arrow to the shoulder, because she was getting super dramatic what with the one guy trying to kill everybody. Really you can\u2019t be mad at her for that, so Samurai Boyfriend is cool about it. She nurses him back to health by changing his bandage and bringing him tea (this is where all that sexy naked shoulder action comes in).One day Samurai Boyfriend is feeling a little better so they break out the tea party and a sumi-e kit (whatever that is), and immediately start seeing shit that\u2019s not there. It becomes evident at this point that the sumi-e kit was a kit for injecting opioid-type drugs. This is where stuff gets weird between the drugs and the fever dreams and crap Naka was having.Not long after that, Naka and Samurai Boyfriend go into town and find a group of catty bitches who tease Naka and Samurai Boyfriends decides he\u2019s going to buy her some new curtains for her room (drugs, amirite?). These are damn nice super classy custom curtains and they have to wait two weeks for them to be made, so they go on a drug and tea fueled romantic walk in a garden, where they talk about flowers; really nice flowers. Naka makes plans to invite the catty bitches over to see her new curtains in two weeks.Eventually, Samurai Boyfriend has to leave because word of his beat-boxing skills have gotten around to some king/queen or such, and he has to go beat-box for them for a while. This leaves Naka SUPER broken up about loosing Samurai Boyfriend, but she goes and pours tea for some other woman for a bit before deciding its time to leave the house all together.Naka packs her curtains, and fucks off with all the tea in the cupboard.Two years later we find Naka on the banks of Isra, having boarded a boat for a new life in the wonderful, beautiful, clean-aired, sparkling freedom city of Isra, which every character should go to and visit (not a paid advertisement.. Naoki I feel like you owe me a beer or something).Naka finds some little girl on the docks who cries about something and that\u2019s where she lives out the rest of her days in peace and harmony.The End!", "link_list": ["/user/426"], "image_list": [], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><u><b><span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-426 group-0\" href=\"/user/426\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@nakatani\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Nakatani</span></a></span>: Sexy Naked Shoulder and Why Tea Parties are Awesome</b></u></div>"}, "post-60993": {"user": "Nakatani", "user_num": 426, "timestamp": "1488742324000", "message": "I bet.. nothing made me laugh as much as reading this xD its perfect!", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "I bet.. nothing made me laugh as much as reading this xD its perfect!"}, "post-60996": {"user": "Badger", "user_num": 2100, "timestamp": "1488742613000", "message": "NakataniHaha well I'm glad you enjoyed it  xD  It was super fun doing it!
