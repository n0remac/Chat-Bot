I'd be willing to 'invite' you guys there, assuming you want to RP as a Varan. Aia and her Mercs want to help out in the Free City, defend it, and they're also looking to cross the Eastern River Crossing and fight hordes of bandits, orcs, undead, etc. maybe there's an evil empire over there we can fight, idk.\u00a0However, there's a few pretty specific rules pertaining to the Varan that your have to follow. More on that later. basically it concerns their clans and lineage, which is hugely important. Also, their Ki'Gars, which are an integral element in Varan culture. I seek to establish your clans and Ki'Gars in Aia's mercenary campaign.\u00a0Would anyone be willing to do this?\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "I'd really like to get Asgeir up and running, becoming a government.
