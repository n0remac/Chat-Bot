I, of course, speak of the Warhammer 40k Ork!I had the\u00a0thought that\u00a0maybe making a race or area just for the Ork as it exists in WH40k (minus the guns and space stuff obviously) would be super cool. This is more of an idea than a suggestion at this point, which is why my pitch for it is basically \"Hey go watch this\".Things about Orks that are conducive to RPing:- They are funny and endlessly entertaining- Their culture is based upon punching face (you can read that as: Tribal dynamics between different subsets of Orks could be interesting given their rich and varied culture)- There is already an established hierarchy- Most of the heavy lifting concerning lore is already done- The barriers\u00a0to entry can be as high or low as the person playing the Ork wants them to be. Want to spend 10 minutes reading and just make an Ork to\u00a0wreck face? Fine. Want to spend days delving deep into the lore, religion\u00a0and culture?

If the Orks existed in a vacuum all alone by themselves, yes absolutely you'd be correct.

I think I'm about half way between where you are and just 100% aping WH40k Orkies. The heavy lifting is already done for us as far as culture, biology, etc etc, so keeping that seems great as a standard pattern. Also it might be really really fun to play out different tribes in-fighting to figure out who the War Boss is. Kind of a political thing but replace the politicians with\u00a0face-punching mutant fungus monsters? Anyway a way to pull other kingdoms/races in might be for someone to see the danger in the greenskins uniting under one War Boss, and they intervene in some way to keep the Orks fighting amongst themselves.Feb 23, 2017 11:05:18 GMT -8 Systkin Ragnarok said:You should make Orks that join with the vikings.

Basically, when all the Orks believe something will work, it works. They believe that wagons that are painted red go faster than wagons that aren't painted red, so they do. A wagon WILL ACTUALLY go faster if an Ork paints it red. They use guns that have exactly no reason they would be functional, except for the fact that the Orks think they work. They breathe in space unassisted because the Orks believe they can breathe in space.Obviously our Orks wouldn't have guns and space travel, but man hilarity ensues when a wall that looks like its made of dried up old beach wood holds like a mighty fortress.They don't actually use magic individually though.Feb 23, 2017 13:42:58 GMT -8 Silver Cloud Yin said:I did have, a long time ago, an Orc character and a location to RP them.

Having some spokes-ork for a tribe that is able to talk to other races rather than punching them seems like a good idea, or at least it'd make things easier logistically. I don't know how this would work yet though!I think Greentide might be a cool name for the \"species\" overall, or at least a decent alternative name for them along with Greenskins, similar to how Ork and Orc are often interchangeable (though Ork generally only refers to Warhammer material, where as Orc is more general fantasy?). We should probably decide whether we want to use Ork or Orc officially, but I don't really mind haha.\u00a0As for how Orcs/Orks exactly work, I think there may have to be some variation. Due to the way the Sandbox works, there's always going to come a time when someone else makes his own race inspired by the Orcs and it will always be a little bit different. Rather then, I suggest we make Greentide a name for not just one Ork 'race', but many of them; each being slightly different in their own way and up to the interpretation of the individual player. What we can then have instead is the ability to specifically state what kind of Ork your character is, as well as requiring characters from a certain 'tribe' or 'mob' be the same Ork type (if the leader of the tribe wishes).\u00a0Of course traditionally, 'Greenskins' refer not only to Orks, but also to Goblins, Gremlins and other creatures of a similarly nasty type.
