It is a cold, harsh, rocky, and ancient land filled with mysterious ruins, legends, and secrets.  It was once dominated by nomadic barbarians who roamed the area, foraging, hunting, and fighting.  Eventually these nomads settled down and formed villages, which culminated in the creation of small kingdoms.  These kingdoms waged war with one another for many years; dynasties would rise and fall, but in the end they all succumbed to the Darkness.  During the Cataclysm, Asgeir was attacked by a dark power, and foreign nations took advantage of that and attacked the Varan kindoms.  Fortunately, in a period known as the Heroic Age, the Varan rallied together and reclaimed their homeland.  After the conflict, many Varan pledged their allegiance to Maurak Borg, the First King of Asgeir, who promptly proclaimed the official founding of the Kingdom of Asgeir.  Today, Asgeir is undergoing critical cultural, diplomatic, and economic changes, a form of movements that is collectively known as the Varan Reformation.The VaranThe Varan, generally speaking, are a tall, fair-skinned, naturally-built warrior-folk believed to have originated from the Northlands (which lies directly north of Asgeir).  It is more of a blanket term for a number of similar, but sometimes different ethnic groups which began to form in the Northlands and Asgeir, and there's common belief that other groups may have been assimilated into the Varan race.An average Varan stands approximately 6', with some reaching heights of over 7', and others being as short as 5'5; mostly, however, height seems to run in the family.  While the brutal and harsh upbringing of Varan children also play a role in their athletically-toned builds, it can be assumed many of them are 'genetically strong', though women are usually slimmer.  There eyes come in many colors, from blue, green, brown, hazel, and even purple.  Hair colors tend to be brown, black, blonde, or red.The Varan, as a whole, are a typically friendly group, valuing honor, courage, loyalty, patriotism, family, and friendship.  They make strong, capable warriors, many of which become sellswords in other lands.  These sellswords are highly sought after for their brutal efficiency, reliability, and undying loyalty.  The average Varan sellsword seeks only a place to live, and access to common necessities; not many of them are usually looking to be given grand sums of gold, so 'price' does not affect their loyalty; once they pledge themselves to someone, it is rare they ever leave them.  Mass groups of Varan sellswords, called Warbands, usually consist of around 50 warriors, though it has been as high as 500.  These Warbands are roaming raiders seeking employment from anyone who can offer them land and accessibility.  These Warbands are also highly sought after, for loyalty and efficiency.  Warbands typically try to settle down and assimilate in other populated regions, merging with the people there.  They're known to be hardworking laborers, and will protect their newfound neighbors with ferocious loyalty.Varan place a high priority on women.  Varan men have always believed women were superior.  In ancient ages, the Varan fought one another for the ownership of women.  They treasure the grace and beauty of the female form.  Varan women have just as many rights as the men, and are treated with far more respect than most women in other parts of the world.  This line of thinking has led the Varan to outright shun the practice of pre-marital sex, believing the innocence and purity of a woman should be kept until she is ceremoniously wed to a man of her choice - and even then she decides when - if ever - to consummate the marriage.  The idea of brothels and whores does not exist in Asgeir, as it is law for women to remain 'pure'.Ki'garsA Ki'gar is a traditional form of clothing worn by all Varan - and is strictly enforced.  A Ki'gar can come in the form of a scarf, a cape, a sash, or something of that nature.  They're knitted from Buunvar fur, which makes the fabric strong and resistant to fire.Ki'gars are usually two colors: one base color, and a trim color (like blue and white).  Usually, a sigil is in the center of the Ki'gar, such as a wolf, with the family name beneath it (like VALGARD).  Some Varan stitch 'achievements' on their Ki'gars, like an X for every time they kill someone.All Varan mothers knit one for their child when they become pregnant; the Ki'gar will keep the newborn warm until he is of age to wear it properly.  From that point on, the Ki'gar rarely comes off.  Bathing is one of the only times a Ki'gar is removed.  It represents your homeland, heritage, and achievements, and to toss it away or show disregard for it is to throw your heritage away - something no Varan would let you get away with.  If a Varan finds a Ki'gar, it is their duty to return it to Asgeir and give it back to the family.  If a Varan sees a non-Varan wearing a Ki'gar, they are suppose to take it - by force if necessary - and return it to Asgeir.  There's strong superstitions that, if you take a fallen Varan's Ki'gar, you will be haunted by Varan spirits.The Realm of AsgeirThe realm is cold year round.  Spring and Summer see cold, chilly days, with frequent rainstorms, while the Fall and Winter experience moderate to heavy snowfall.  It is common practice to forage and farm during the Spring and Summer, and then keep some of the items stored throughout the Fall and Winter; during the Fall and Winter, hunting and fishing is widely practiced more often than other periods of the year.Western Asgeir is rocky, with good farming land hard to come by.  A set of mountain ranges border the realm on its western border, giving birth to many freshwater rivers which flow south and all throughout western Asgeir.  The rocky terrain is less rocky the further south you go.  Eastern Asgeir, more known as the Eastern Plains, is a more flat, sometimes hilly and heavily forested region.  It has suitable land for farming, and many freshwater lakes, ponds, streams, and rivers; horses are very common in this area.Bears, wolves, sabre-tigers, and buunvar are some of the more dangerous beasts of Asgeir, more common in the west than the east.  Deer, elk, rabbit, beaver, horses, and cows roam the entire landscape, though are much more common in the east.  Dragons once inhabited the area, but many were hunted down and slayed by the ancient Varan.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "This is for reference for the realm of Asgeir, the Kingdom of Asgeir, and its people: the Varan."}, "post-6454": {"user": "Ralf Valgard, the White Wolf", "user_num": 451, "timestamp": "1439602971000", "message": "Important Houses/Clans of AsgeirHouse BorgTraits:\u00a0 Greatswords;
