I created my own direction without using a quest or making a group..but i feel like a lot of other newbies aren't going to know how to do that or know what to do D: i propose more quests be made, but im not good at thinking up of stories, i'd rather play them and make them as I go. so maybe some discussion here in the ooc forum can spark some new ideas for quests if people collaborate together. ill try to start thinking of quest ideas myself.I think its also important to remember that we shouldn't try to model quests after the kinds you find in RPGs or sometimes tabletops. i think because this is all writing rp without stats, stories should focus on situations that cause unique interactions between rpers, particularly in a social sense..but perhaps that going to X dungeon, killing 5 of these creatures, and retrieving resources or items for an npc may be tedious to actually write out without a stat-based gaming system. so it's almost like our quest ideas have to be even more original, more interesting, than typical rp quests.thoughs?", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "I think we need to focus more on making interesting quests.
