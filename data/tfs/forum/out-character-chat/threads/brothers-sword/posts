They ride white steeds into battle, and are among the greatest heavy cavalry in the Overworld.  Teutonic Knights are well-trained, disciplined, and devoted to Angelism.  Seeing them on the battlefield strikes fear into the hearts of their enemies.Notable MembersKonrad IV von Marschburg - Current Hochmeister (grandmaster) and founder of the order.\u00a0 A devout follower of Angelism, and a powerful warrior.Adrian von Heschburg - Trusted komtur, and friend of Konrad IV, Adrian was chosen to be the komtur of the Free City chapter house.Gustav von Valland - Another trusted komtur, and native Varan of Asgeir, Gustav is the knight-commander at the Stormhold chapter house.Heinrich von Schaufen - An excellent warrior whose antics on the battlefield earned him some fame.\u00a0 Heinrich was promoted to komtur shortly after the successful Crusade in the East.Giplor Vauc'Tutt of Ozmodias - Warrior from the Phoenix State and current komtur of its chapter house and chapel.Forces (max allowed: 500 slots; 166 total soldiers or 498 'NPC slots')(As the order is small and has strict requirements for joining, they call upon allies, mercenaries, volunteers, and fanatic followers of Angelism to bolster their forces.\u00a0 The primary unit of the order are the Teutonic Knights, for which there are few).The Free City30 Teutonic Knights (cavalry), under the command of Komtur Adrian von Heschburg.Stormhold, Asgeir16 Teutonic Knights (cavalry), under the command of Komtur Gustav von Valland.Aaedan90 Teutonic Knights (cavalry), under the command of Hochmeister Konrad IV and Komtur Heinrich Von Schaufen.Phoenix State30 Teutonic Knights (cavalry), under the command of Komtur Giplod Vauc'Tutt of Ozmodias. EstablishmentsArburg Keep - A fortification built long ago by the by the first Vessians in their war against the Wickans of Eastwick.\u00a0 It was abandoned later, after the cataclysm, and upon the arrival of the Swordbrethren, the Wickans took control of it.\u00a0 Konrad IV personally laid siege to the fortress and took it by force with the help of Raena Fletcher.\u00a0 It now serves as the northern headquarters of the order.\u00a0 It has been rebuilt, renovated, and expanded to suit the order's needs.Stormhold Chapter House and Chapel - With the approval of the High King of Asgeir, a chapter house and chapel was built within the city of Stormhold.\u00a0 It is commandeered by Komtur Gustav von Valland.Phoenix State Chapter House and Chapel - With the support of Komtur Giplor Vauc-Tutt of Ozmodias, the order has built a hosptial, chapel, and chapter house in the Phoenix State.Free City Hospice - With permission from Lord Ildesias, the order now owns its second-largest establishment: the Free City Hospice.\u00a0 Complete with a chapter house, chapel, hospital, and even orphanage.White City Chapter House and Chapel - PendingRanksHochmeister - The absolute leader of the order, and highest authority of its military branch.\u00a0 If the Hochmeister answers to anyone, it is the Bishops of Angelism, the High King of Asgeir, or the Emperor of Vessex.\u00a0 The current Hochmeister is Konrad IV von Marschburg, a native of Vessex, and founder of the order.GrandKomtur - GrandKomturs are second in the heirarchy, and may be given charge of specific charters of regions for when the Hochmeister needs them too, watching over his own Komturs.\u00a0 There are currently no GrandKomturs, as the Hochmeister can easily monitor the activities of his current Komtur's within the northeast.Komturs - Primary commanders of the order, given charge of a specific chapter house and given command of some knights.\u00a0 Komturs monitor their immediate areas.Teutonic Knights - The knights refer to one another as Knight-Brothers, but outside of their jurisdiction they are referred to as the Teutonic Knights.\u00a0 Well-trained, well-equipped knights, with white steeds, these knights make up the primary unit of the order's military, serving beneath a komtur.OrdenBruders - Translated as 'Order-Brothers', these individuals are not exactly knights.\u00a0 They're given white cloaks and steel weapons.\u00a0 These usually consist of volunteers, fanatics, or mercenaries who wish to help the order for at least a little while.\u00a0 They're usually reserved as archers, infantry, or spearmen.Bishops - These men are in no way fighters, but are important to spread the word of Angelism, offer healing, and tend to the dying.", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/497/", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/680/brothers-sword-chapter-house-chapel", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/692/brothers-sword-chapter-house-chapel", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/703/brothers-sword-free-city-hospice"], "image_list": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Insignia_Germany_Order_Teutonic.svg/2000px-Insignia_Germany_Order_Teutonic.svg.png"], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><img alt=\"The Black Cross\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Insignia_Germany_Order_Teutonic.svg/2000px-Insignia_Germany_Order_Teutonic.svg.png\" width=\"348\"/><br/></div>"}, "post-10775": {"user": "Grand Komtur: Giplor Vauc'Tutt", "user_num": 648, "timestamp": "1442794877000", "message": "Hey, i'm in.
