(From Trade Agreements, Allies or Enemies). Secondly, if you own a business or village in The Phoenix State, please give a short biography of how you came TPS. Finally, if TFS could give a short biography on itself and each \u00a0player could give a quick bit of feedback on their stay at TFS and how it has been for them from start to finish.This would be very much appreciated. Hope we can get this done soon so I can finish up work and let you all see!If possible, could we get this as a special request that appears at the top of each page?\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<font face=\"comic sans ms\">As i've been stating in chat, I am working on something that is beneficial for the entire RP Universe.
