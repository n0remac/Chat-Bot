What I've thought up so far about it is this:An Eighth Crown = Pocket money for children.A Quarter Crown = hourly wage for unskilled labour (think potwashing). A Half Crown = hourly wage for average work. One Crown = hourly wage for skilled work.This is a simple guide though, and while prices may be adjusted accordingly it may differ; as might the wage according to supply and demand of items. Price list guide:An apple = an eighth crown. A loaf of bread = a quarter crown. Pint of ale = a quarter crown. A meal in a tavern = three quarter crowns - one crown. Generally, the price of an object is determined by sum of what goes into it. For instance, if we take a look at an average steel sword:I've been told it takes an average of a hundred + hours to make a functional sword from scratch and weaponsmithing would be classed as skilled labour, so we can deduce that a battle-worthy steel sword might cost a hundred crowns. We can also assume that the ore it took to make the sword came from average labour and needed to be transported and bought, so we could add another 10 crowns to cover the cost of the ore and perhaps another 10 on top of that if swords are in high demand. In this case, we could say that a steel sword might cost an average of 100-120 crowns. That could be lowered, perhaps, to around 50-60 crowns for a lower quality iron sword. Obviously, however, this is a very basic attempt at economy. There's likely to be hundreds of factors that would push the price either up or down. Looking at historical sources, the average sword in medieval times cost the same as what the majority of peasants earned in 120 days, so in actual fact the examples I gave above are incredibly cheap.

Then the site would have to have a shop to spend these at. If anyone has eveever been to Animeforum, this is how they done it. <br><br/>RP style, each person would have to independently state how much gold they started with and ended with in a town. Also, as stated earlier, each nation is different. For example, The Phoenix State is loaded with valuable stones and metals, which makes gold and such less valuable there. In turn, due to a lack of vegetation, a sack of corn is worth more to them than a sack of gold.<br/><br/>It would be opposite in Medan where vegetation is plentiful but gold isn't. So we could set up trades and currencies, but the actual value of it would be dependent on the players. <br/><br/>In truth, there is no actual way to RP an economy. It would have to be OOC coinage that is used via RP. <br/><br/>We could just use Credit Leaves instead of credit cards...i can see it now..<br/><br/>\"Do you accept Oak Leaf or Locust Leaf credit?\" Customers says<br/><br/>\"Would you like some ranch on that with a steak on the side?\" clerk responds.<div class=\"quote_clear\"></div></br></div></div>"}, "post-3974": {"user": "Lamina Manira", "user_num": 157, "timestamp": "1433795824000", "message": "i don't think money was ever the wisest choice for quest rewards. good quests will reward players with trust, new IC relations and connections, and possibly new IC privileges.
