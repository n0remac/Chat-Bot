At last the second question came, and he was glad to distract himself from the nonsense.\"Well I doubt anything I could scrounge together could ever hope to hold a candle to your radiance but I suppose I'd have to start with freshly cut thin sliced Katashiman beef sauteed in Medanese Gold with two pinches of saffron to even out the taste. Then of course it simply must be served on a bed of fried rice with fire roasted carrot bits mixed in, mind you they must be diced not sliced! As for the beverage I think I'd break out a bottle of my personal favorite ambrosia known as The Sin, a savory drink concocted via the more eloquent minded demons. It goes down smooth and its surprisingly sweet fruity taste means it can be used as a good marinate... But I digress, onto the piece de resistance! For desert I'd choose something almost as sweet as you, a fruit parfait! Making sure that it is as succulent to look at as it is to eat I would have to be sure to twirl the blended strawberries and blueberries separately in order for them to layer atop each other in a pleasing manner.
