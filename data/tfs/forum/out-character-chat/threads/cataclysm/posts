(No not all dragons, silly. This will be where a majority of a dragon's roots come from. I do this so if someone does not agree to my lore and back story they may still make their own.)First off lets get simple stuff outta the way, the dragons I speak of vary in color and size, from purple to gold to green to cobalt (and many more) their sizes range from 4 feet tall to 60 feet tall (due to large range of species, NOTE these sizes are at age adult, young is smaller elder and ancient are larger.) They also have 2 wings attached to torso and are quadruped. (They can stand on 2 legs if need be) ALL of them are born knowing the language of Draconic and a majority of them are born with a gift to sense and use magic and the arcane arts.Ok, now that I got that outta the way we can get into the LORE.The Dragons originate from the continent of Wer Thaczil Di Wer Darastrix or more simply, Darastrix. (NOTE: Only dragon characters may reach or speak of this land as it is uncharted and dragons have recently returned and all known dragon riders died) This continent is VERY LARGE and contains MANY BIOMES thus allowing dragons of all types to be made from 'Lo. ('Lo is essentially God to dragons but most dragons have become atheist due to him not protecting and guiding the dragons during the Darastrix Hunt.) Some of this will be explained via a dragon lore thread in which I will more thoroughly explain background. Pre-Cataclysm: Dragons were generally considered neutral as they never attacked or assisted other races or kingdoms, they were there to keep the world equal. Also dragon riders and dragons were plentiful. (It was not rare so see or meet a dragon) Eventually the world started to fill with greed, death, and betrayal between kingdoms and nations and the dragons sought to equalize it. However a majority of people were against the dragons \"equalizing\" and thus the cataclysm began and also did the Darastrix Hunt. The extermination of EVERY living dragon. This time the dragons and their opponents suffered many deaths on both sides. The dragons, guided by Lo, left the mainland and fled to Darastrix with their riders, leaving all to the internal conflict known as the Cataclysm.Present-Post Cataclysm: This mass immigration of dragons caused civil wars, overpopulation, poor living conditions, religious quarrels, Holy wars, mass deaths and starvation. The Riders and their Dragons passed away, leaving only wild dragons. (This is because the bond completely reduces fertility rate to an all time low for both the dragon and the rider to about 0.0003% of having offspring.)The race of dragons reduced to its lowest to about only 10,000 left, from then on the dragons reunited together, and thus, the end of the Cataclysm. Their numbers reached about 88,000 and few started to return to the mainland. (My character being one of them.)They were not greeted nicely, people remembered them for leaving them when they needed them most, claiming they did not help, regardless of the Darastrix Hunt. Thus while they were gone, folk tales, stories, poems, and such portrayed the dragons as \"bad guys.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "I am going to add a before and present-after lore of the dragons for the cataclysm.

Of course this doesn't apply to all elves... Well on to it then.Elves are a tall nimble race 6-7 feet sometimes taller sometimes shorter. They are usually of fair skin and hair. Their eyes could be any color but most common was light brown or gold. They live roughly twice the span of humans but they have been known to live up to a thousand years. As a race they have an affinity for magic. Their graceful builds made them the greatest archers, hunters and rouges. As warriors its best they wear light or medium armor as to not bog down their natural agility. Culturally the elves were a happy people. They played music, danced, and feasted on the bounty of the forest regularly. They used their magics to bend their will and lift rocks from beneath the earth. Their masonry was commonly one solid rock \"grown\" from the ground into the shape the mason willed. Many of these seem as though they are many pieces by design. It was commonplace for the faces to elvish gods to adorn their buildings along with vines, trees, animals, and other things from nature. Their garments were primarily leather gathered by hunters or cloth like wool, silk or cotton. Their cloth garments are usually unadorned but veryclean. They treated their leather with more care in its crafting than anything. No magic to aid them, only true artisans could create fine elven leather adorned with more than their buildings. Elven forged weapons in a unique way. The wood they need would be grown directly out of the trees, and they would sing the metal out of the earth. They would then, often with the aid of a dragon, heat the metal and sing it into shape. Each piece of weapons and armor was created through these rituals though they worked leather like any other race. Their weaponry is famed for many things: They never need to be maintained or sharpened. They are extremely light, even full steel plate feels lighter than chain mail. Their blades where elegantly curved with the point lining with the handle. The blades could both slash and stab with ease. Their spears were long, twice as tall as a common elf. A long spear point with two small curved spikes at the base and a weighted pummel for balance, they fit the bill of a spear and a halberd. Their bows were always make of a special wood that was lighter than oak but as strong as iron. Long and recurved the bow would usually be etched with vines, sometimes filled with metals. Its bowstring used to be made with giant spider silk. Hunters would further adorn their bows with feathers and/or tails taken from their prey. Their armor was forged and adorned in the same way as their steel weapons. Their shields were often solid steel. For scouts and archers their shield was round with adornments of their own choosing. For Heavy Elven Infantry however their shields were as tall as they and was shaped like a folded up wing of an eagle. The Heavy Elven Infantry would carry spears and have elven two-handed swords strapped across their back. Their armor all uniform with feathers being their prime adornment, save for their cuirasses where each of the ten tribes had their own markings to distinguish themselves.Before the Cataclysm: The Elvish people were once a proud and noble people who spread out from the Midlands and beyond. They are believed to have founded the Druidic branch of magic and their Druids were the religious leaders of the people. Hunting animals was ,and still is, considered a sacred act. The Elven Realms were led by a council of ten kings known as I'Nir'aran (e-neer-ah-rahn) who would gather only in times of war. This was perhaps their downfall. The Elvish were scattered to the winds long before the cataclysm. They say a human king, a friend of the Elves, turned the I'Nir'aran against each other and the wars broke the elves. After many years of infighting the unknown human king marched on the elven lands and took them for his own. The surviving elves scattered. With them they took what knowledge they could. Many joined human towns and cities. More fled to the wild places and tried their best to continue their traditions. The elves that scattered to the wild places had begun to take on their own customs and their history had began to become legends by the time the cataclysm came upon the world. The cataclysm only helped to break the elven race more. Many of the city elves died and the Wild Elvish ran deeper into the wilds to escape the cataclysm. Most of there elven crafts lost. After the Cataclysm: In the Overworld elves, as a whole, have little to do with the many kingdoms that rose after the cataclysm. The Wild Elves are many now but they are still a broken and fragmented race. The scar of infighting is still fresh and elvish tribes don't trust each other. As civilization grows after the cataclysm, the wild places and the hidden elves within are encroached upon, conflict is inevitable. With weapons and armor passed down from well before the Cataclysm, and weapons they have created on their own they are more than prepared to take on threats. Perhaps outside threats could unite them once more and return the grace of the elves to Overworld.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Well since there is no lore for the elves I'm gonna put my imagination, along with some of what I learned here, to use and piece together some Lore of the Elves Before during and after the cataclysm.

With their lands using the outskirts of what is now known as the Free Plains and a few others, they farmed these lands. Very prosperous and peaceful, standing as an icon in the Overworld. It's trade routes and medical facilities, hospitals, and medical education, extended to the far eastern coast of the Overworld.\u00a0Due to the structure of their governing body, which is similar to many, ruled by a family, would be their downfall. The ties of the family were close, and their presence across the map was outstanding. Despite their beliefs, to add a new scroll to the collection. They decided to adopt a child of Dark Elves. Raising it from the moment he was born, he was treated no different by his brother. For many years this family remained united.\u00a0Squabblings began to come about here and there as the father and mother began to age, passing most things on to the two children. The squabblings were simple matters, never really changing things. One day the brothers got into a serious argument. One wanted to expand the empire by physically taking it, the other wanting to do it diplomatically and properly. A temporary agreement was made, and the two began to expand the empire, doing both at the same time. Many kingdoms extending to the Blackfog Mountains were conquered, leveling some and building some. One land in particularly divided the brothers. One knew the people from there and the other simply wanted to wipe them out and recolonize it. \u00a0Here is where Zaltos Kiraxo and Jimpow Kiraxo stood toe to toe for the first time, dividing the land. This battle would evolve into a war within itself. Over two thousand people in this village, 200,000 men died. When this happened, many communications were dropped and the empire returned to the desert. It didn't take long for lands to capitalize on the free open land left behind.\u00a0This was a spark to the Cataclysm. Instead of one empire keeping steady orders and casting fear into it's enemies eyes, costing less lives in battle. They acted as the Persian Empire, offering many beneficial things if they surrendered their land, and if not, they would take it. Now there was numerous kingdoms doing this now. Years later, forts and castles were built here and there, but the warfare never stopped. With the disappearance of The Phoenix State who cut off all trade and connections, waging war within it's lands between tribes and capitols. Greed swept the Overworld, and a Med-Evil like series of events began to unfold. One fact was known, despite it's own personal war, many species of animals and intelligent life forms began to migrate there. They told tales of terror and war, looking towards the desert for safety if they could survive. \u00a0Those who survived the trip were \u00a0a large boost towards their population. This formed new tribes and colonies that would unite, practicing and praying to the gods of these lands, the Six Faces and Amun Ra.Despite the waging war that fizzling out, Zaltos and Jimpow still had a disagreement. The land was split, the Valheecius Desert was Zaltos's and the Gate of the Valheecius Desert was Jimpow. Under Zaltos, the Valheecius Desert seen a golden age, having only to worry about itself and it's population and production growing due to it's industrialization for war supplies. Besides their own war they were capitalizing on, they were beginning to open trade routes capitalize on the war surrounding their lands without realizing it.\u00a0After the Cataclysm, the lands of The Phoenix State were divided from themselves and the world. Life was minimal outside the desert, but the people were scared to return, deciding to remain in The Phoenix State. With a unanimous decision between capitols and tribes, they decided to remove themselves from the world, making absolutely no contact whatsoever. They destroyed all paths and routes, posting militants on the routes to turn any travelers around.\u00a0After many years, The Phoenix State has reunited and made contact with the Overworld. As for being part of the Cataclysm, they set the playing field for it to unfold. Instead of being in battle with the others, they took in the refugees of the Cataclysm, mostly putting their problems to the side to help these people. Only tales were told, The Phoenix State turning into mythology to the outside world.------------------------------------------------These are the facts brought together by the Scout Union of The Phoenix State. There is room for errors, but this is the best we have been able to provide due to the lack of mapping and history in this period. Please, if any nation has information on the Cataclysm that could add to this history of The Phoenix State in the Cataclysm, we will gladly review it.

The founders of Ivelius were revolutionaries who raged a three-decade spanning guerilla war against the Sorcerer-Kings of Lorik. A truly ancient civilization, Lorik was a state formed by the alliance of seven undying Sorcerer Kings. Practicing fell magics all but forgotten today the lich kings traded their humanity with daemons for untold power. Their dominion was twofold: with their power they conquered the entirety of what is now Imperial territory, along with the wastes and a number of settlements and fortresses beyond it. They enslaved all peoples the encountered, branding them with terrible sigils. The unholy magic contained in the marks allowed the lich overlords to sense dissent among their slaves and  to subsume the will of those marked, warping minds and forcing those who opposed them to brutally kill themselves and their loved ones. Thus the lich's captives were held body and spirit to their overlord's whims.Most of the history, both oral and written, regarding the birth of the Serpent-worshipping cult is patchy or entirely falsified by modern revisionists. Whether from shear willpower and faith (the official story read in churches today) or through magic and pacts with a particular arch-daemon (the story only found in the insane writings found (and subsequently destroyed under Imperial edict) in the catacombs of Hermit's Hill), the truth is that a fanatical, militaristic resistance group comprised entirely of humans was able to resist the power of the liches. As the rites to assume un-life required mass sacrifice and great expense, the undead sorcerers of the Lich-Kings were relatively few in number. Thus years of attrition, assassinations, and hit-and-run attacks eroded the Lich's power, as did the rumors themselves regarding the early Sancturians.Retreating to their power-bases in Iovoth (modern-day Lorikar) and Heritus (modern-day Hermit's Hill), the liches soon met their doom. Again here the official story diverges from the likely truth. The twin fortresses of Iovoth and Heritus were destroyed by twin volcanic eruptions. In Hermit's Hill Today you can still see the remnents of one of the pyroclastic flows at the Foghold. Here the walls are still speckled with ash, and the ash-encrusted of the Lichs still stand at battlements like eerie gargoyles, their heads long since removed. Imperial religious documents describe a revel like no other, the first Conflagration upon the mountains of what is now Ivelua. At the apex of the ceremony two cracks were heard off in the distance. As the skies darkened with night and ash the worshipers descended from their mountain hideaways to find their enemies destroyed. Heretical scholars suggest instead that the eruptions were the result of a mass ritual and sacrifice, which invoked the serpent.In the resulting power-vacuum that resulted from the demise of the ancient Sorcerer-Kings, the Serpent-Cult fell in as the dominant faction. Expelling all non-humans (often violently) from the peninsula, the cultists founded the Empire of Ivelius.The line of Emperors can be traced back to the founder of the cult. Hundreds of years later, Ivelius is now a theocratic empire with lands stretching from the tip of the peninsula at Nanut to the Lich's primary seat of power in Hermit's Hill.-The writings of Mathius Hent, ex-historian and convicted heretic.
