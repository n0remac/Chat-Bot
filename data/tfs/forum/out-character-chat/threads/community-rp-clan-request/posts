Our homesite would be TFS. Later, we could expand to our sister site, TGS. This is the land this specific clan protects.\u00a0Generally, this clan knows how to fight T1 and Story combat. A lot of places require specific knowledge on T1 combat. We will not enforce this, as I know there are a few on here who are really good. If you want to learn, one of the clan members will teach you.\u00a0Why is a clan so important?If a someone or something else, such as a clan, decides that they want to come and take our RP lands, much like Ivelius originally sought out to do, we can challenge them to PC vs. PC combat, and if they lose, they leave. What happens here, is the ones who like our site and want to start actually RPing stick around while others like Mesiphidon get banned because they're douchebags.In turn, we can also be the douchebags and take their lands in our name. This means we can freely advertise our RP's here \u00a0while furthering our nations. We don't have to, but we can. We just become the badasses in their lands and most want to join the strong guys. \u00a0We all have our issues, but this is our RP home. We've all worked hard to get it here, and we have much further to go. This is much like an Oath to TFS that no matter our OOC differences, that we swear to defend this site and it's roleplayers from any outside force that threatens it.\u00a0Over all, this benefits RP on a larger scale. The more people that RP together, the more that start doing it. I know it sounds crazy, but when I started 14 years ago, RP was very popular with hundreds of sites full of RP's. So much that RP was going on in chats and forums. RP Clans were needed because you never knew what would come and try to wreck your stuff. As long as they enter following the rules, it is very possible. We've seen one failed attempt, but still an attempt. We're far enough along that this RP clan is needed.All it requires in one IC character that is capable of being adapted to much higher scales of RP combat if needed, much to what we call OP. The more we can keep out via combat, the more actual RP will come along here that is beneficial, because our clan's strength is the representation of our site, and as previously stated many times on this site, people wanna RP where the action is; and these people will adjust to be allowed to RP here.I figure it's a good idea to throw out there. It gives TFS one more thing to be desired when RP'ing here. The IC moderators of the Overworld.
