As one could surmise I am Maelik, or as I prefer to be addressed Mae-Mae/Uncle Mae/ or at times Maelik Ramsay. If I had to classify myself I'd have to say that I'm more of a story driven RP'er. I much prefer the joys of working out a particular setting and experiencing character development and emotional conflicts over swordplay and warfare.Once upon a time I was much more enamored with the concept of domination and violent confrontation, creating a flowing combat narrative and eliminating my opponent's defensive options one by one. At the time it felt more like a game of chess with each side of the board possessing different (sometimes wildly so) pieces and the goal was to achieve an artistic checkmate. And while I still do enjoy a good fight once in a while when I do get into a tussle I generally lean more towards creating a satisfying story within the battle rather than going full out and systematically crushing the enemy outright. Instead of pressing forward with an advantage and going for a lethal blow I'd allow for damage to sneak in and really draw the other player into the experience. Rather than simply spell bombing an obvious melee oriented character from afar I'd engage them in swordplay.By design Maelik is a strong, durable, menacing character who's threatening on many different levels, but even when he's challenged by a regular guy I usually don't make him unassailable. For me there's no fun in a one sided beatdown in which there was never any hope for the other guy. Of course that isn't to say that I don't play to his strengths when necessary or make exceptions for things that would otherwise simply not work. An example being somebody lobbing a fireball at him or letting loose a blast of demonic energy. Logically those forms of attack would prove ineffective and I wouldn't make it so that he was gravely injured by it without significant reason. Likewise with a regular old sword wielded by an amateur. Of course a stab in the right spot with enough force would hurt him but simply flailing one's arms and striking his armor will garner little more than a few scratches on the metal.But I digress, nowadays I'm far more enthused with the idea of playing out a scene and discovering other facets of a character. Their flaws, their hopes, their likes, their believes, all of it is fascinating. To sort through a romance is delightful, to goof around with a funny post is a treat, and to guide myself past a depression is fulfilling. Giving depth to a character and learning the depths of others is something that I strive for now. So while I won't shrug away a combat post (so long as it's there for a reason!) I still wish for it to be known that story is my main objective currently.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Salutations all, I'm sure that most of you already know who I am but I'll introduce myself none the less.
