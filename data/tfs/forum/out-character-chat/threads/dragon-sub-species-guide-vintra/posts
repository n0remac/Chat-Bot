Vintra dragons are genetically different than their many dragon kin south of Drumbar, causing their lifestyles to be so, so different. The Vintra dragons are more primitive and feral than their southern cousins, most of them driven on instinct and wild impulses. Being less intelligent in general, the average Vintra dragons do not speak in any shape or form, they are beasts without empathy or existential thought.Vintra dragons are ancient, and it is the belief of many scholars that the species is entirely extinct, due to the fact that no pack has been documented for millenia. The average Vintra dragons live in bands, or packs of up to five, sharing their spoils and protecting one another till death do them part. It might sound terrifying to imagine five dragons all set on murdering and destroying everything they cross paths with, but the average Vintra dragons are a lot smaller than many of their peers. An average male could hope to reach a length of 25 feet, your average female about 18 ft. Other than being smaller and weaker than most dragons, the Vintra dragons do not posses the ability to breathe fire or anything of the like, their teeth and claws their only means of defense.\u00a0An average Vintra dragon will live for a few centuries, producing off-spring perhaps every other decade. Vintra dragons are covered in scales of crystal clear blue, making them blend in very well in their natural habitat. These scales are said to be able to withstand most weapons a human could carry. Humans in the ancient world used the siege tool, ballista to shoot the Vintra out of the sky, and it seemed to work fine for them.\u00a0What makes the Vintra dragon special is the fact that with every egg\u00a0fertilized, there is a\u00a0minuscule\u00a0chance of mutation causing the unborn dragon to develop into an elder dragon. Elder dragons are considered magical by many cultures, but scholars have determined that it is simply the race attempting to develop. An elder dragon can not breed with any average Vintra dragon, and so it has never happened that two elder dragons produced off-spring, seeing as the chance of a male and a female finding each other are close to zero. These elder dragons are undocumented to modern man, many different sources claiming that over the years, elder dragons had been found breathing frost instead of fire, a wild speculation.\u00a0Elder dragons never stop growing, they can surpass their lesser kin into infinity if left alive for long enough, however the rate of their growth is\u00a0ridiculously\u00a0low. Elder dragons can speak, are intelligent and usually seclude themselves from other dragons, living lives in solitude far away from civilization.
