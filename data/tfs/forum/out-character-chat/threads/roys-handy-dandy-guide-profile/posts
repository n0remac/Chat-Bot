As a long-time player of TFS with what some would consider \"far too many\" characters, I know the struggle of finding suitable pictures for your characters. In fact, it's sometimes harder than making the character itself. I get it, you have an image in your mind of your character's flowing white locks and chiseled jaw and none of the images are just right. However, sometimes compromises must be made. After all, nobody wants to look at that ugly white default image box. Therefore, here are some resources that I've used in the past.Pinterest\u00a0I know, I know. Pinterest is for moms. But it's also a very useful tool for finding pictures. Once you've made an account, loads of excellent potential profile pictures are right at your fingertips. Just type in a simple description of what you're looking for, and scroll through hundreds of results. Warning: pinterest tends to be addictive.RedditThere are quite a few subreddits dedicated to art, and they're all quite handy if you just want to browse and look for inspiration.\u00a0www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryWarriors/, for example, has quite the selection of armored heroes to choose from. That particular sub also links to a collection of other similar subreddits, themed around archers, nobles, and other such character types. The disadvantage of reddit, however, is that the search function is extremely lacking.DeviantartDeviantart can be a fantastic resource, especially if you already have an artist in mind that you like. If you view a particular picture, the site links you to collections that the picture is in, other work by the same artist, and similar images. It's very helpful, especially if you've found a particular style you like.Anime Characters DatabaseIf you like anime-styled characters, this is the resource for you. This site allows you to search by gender, hair color, hair length, and age, which can be extremely helpful if there's a certain \"look\" you're going for. The art style isn't for everyone, but pictures are plentiful. A side bonus is that it gives you specific characters, which allows you to find multiple images of the same character.Other Tips and TricksIf you have a very specific look in mind and the pictures you've found just aren't doing it for you, there are other options. Some players (Skarlet, for example) draw their own profile pics. However, many of us aren't skilled enough to do that, and we pay other people to do it for us. Commissioned pictures are an expensive solution, but they're probably the best way to get the most accurate representation of your character. Asking other players for help is also an option, as many of us are willing to help find suitable pictures. As mentioned before, if you use a character from a video game or show as your base, you can usually find fanart and additional images of your character with relative ease.", "link_list": ["https://www.pinterest.com/", "http://reddit.com", "https://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryWarriors/", "https://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryWarriors/", "http://www.deviantart.com/", "https://www.animecharactersdatabase.com/", "/user/257"], "image_list": [], "html": "Hey folks!
