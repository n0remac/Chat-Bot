Whether that be murder, debauchery, arson, backstabbing, theft, kidnapping, plotting, double-crossing, causing general chaos, or simply burning everything to the ground has yet to be seen. Simply stated, I intend to be something of a Joker, and you would be my Gotham. <br/><br/>Now, let's have some fun, shall we?<br/><br/>Also, if you need a villain for any reason, drop me a line, and I'll see what I can't do.

Your character page seems coherent enough, though there are a few minor grammatical errors. As for where to start, you\u2019ve got some options. Speaking generally, I tend to advise people to start somewhere where there is already RP going on, already characters there to play with, lest a new character sit alone in some abandoned thread. Further, I\u2019m biased because I run Isra, but it is my thought that Isra the best place to start out, due to the high population and central-ness of it. There, one can introduce their character, meet some other characters, and progress from that point easily, so it\u2019s my first suggestion. Beyond that, you\u2019ve got more or less all of the other nations. Tawakoshi and Vessia are biased against magic, with persecution for magic users and such, but that might be an interesting thing to RP. The Land Tillers\u2019 Expanse has some druids of its own, with their own circle and whatnot. The people are close to the earth (hence the name), so you\u2019d probably be in good company there, though the player who runs it isn\u2019t very active at the moment. Many parallels can be drawn between Gauldin and medieval renaissance France with the addition of magic. It has a magic academy and a fair number of things to do as a tourist if that\u2019s what you might fancy. Alban is based upon an interesting premise of four races occupying the land mass, each with their respective leaders and cities and such. To begin things on TFS, the current king went through some hoops to reunite the races under the banner of Alban. Over there, they\u2019ve got some Wildlings and some Fae, which might have some thoughts on your druid. Their \u201cWyld\u201d might be something Eredin would like to study. Esrara is unique in that it\u2019s a floating island. Some of the people there have wings and their military rides what are essentially giant eagles. I don\u2019t know what all you\u2019d do there, but it\u2019s an interesting setting. Aozora was created with the intention of offering an alternative for new players who wanted somewhere easy to go besides Isra. The nation itself was created through RP here, interestingly enough. It\u2019s population is refugees from some of TFS\u2019 war-torn and lost countries. Alternatively, there are the Open Lands, and all sorts of places in there. I don\u2019t keep up with those much, but the Open Lands tend to be popular with new players. If you have any questions, feel free to ask here, in the shoutbox, or send me a message. I hope you enjoy playing here. ", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Welcome to TFS, Rick. Your character page seems coherent enough, though there are a few minor grammatical errors.

Are there any threads that go over what is realistic or not concerning characters and their abilities? I have some ideas but I don't know if they would fit well and be realistic or acceptable. Thank you!\u00a0Welcome! You should definitely\u00a0read the getting started thread. All the essential\u00a0information is there. Naoki's style guide is also a good resource. As far as realism goes you can basically create anything that is within the rules. \u00a0The basics are that technology does not advance past the medieval\u00a0period (so no guns) and characters cannot be invincible. Gods are not allowed, but daemons, angels, and other demigods are.\u00a0Keep in mind that any other player has the potential to be as strong as your character (when it comes to combat). Some players chose to play weaker characters. Out of combat magic and abilities can be basically limitless. The main goal is to make your posts such that other people will enjoy and play off them. When in combat rules can sometimes become very nitpicky. Charge counters are used to gauge strengths of attacks based on post number. \u00a0If you are charging you must somehow allude\u00a0to it and the duration. This might seems like it makes things too easy, but there are many ways to disguise your charges. This aspect of combat creates a sort of meta game.It is generally best to start with a less powerful character and grow from there. \u00a0I did not do such with this dragon character and it caused many problems along the way (although that is what I was going for). It can be really fun to allow your character to grow in game. \u00a0As far as your background goes there is such a diverse group here that anything can find a place to fit in.Isra is usually an easy place to start out. \u00a0You can later post in multiple threads. Gualdin\u00a0is themed\u00a0around France and is currently holding a tournament. Tawakoshi is based on Japan and seems to become more active recently. There are lots of things to do in the open lands/seas, but they can be dangerous (other players can actually kill your characters on this site). The other nations would be happy for newcomers as well.

There aren't any threads that directly address what I think you're referring to. There aren't any stated limits on what is and is not acceptable. The range of characters and their abilities is great, as most things are acceptable on TFS under the broad theme of medieval fantasy, so as so long as your ideas generally fit within that theme, they ought to be quite fine. The only other significant thing to consider in that regard are such that no character may be invincible, so characters that are gods aren't kosher. Alluding to gods, and mortal characters using some magic or ability relating to a god is fine, just not playing as one. Odds are, whatever you have in mind is probably quite acceptable.

There are a few players who maintain threads in the Open Lands, so you should use consideration when choosing.\u00a0Strangers and Travelers runs threads that are similar in ways to what one might think of as guided roleplay with a GM/DM. They present these locations of theirs, and characters are free to explore and interact as they see fit, and this often leads into adventures, as it were. The other sorts of threads in the open lands are a varied bunch, but not many intentionally geared toward new players. I would point out The Tower of Eons if you'd like to do a structured dungeon sort of thing,\u00a0The Floating City of Esharra, if you'd like to... do sky stuff. (I'm not entirely sure what all goes on there.) And the Traveler's Rest Inn\u00a0as some non-Strangers threads that you may find accommodating.But that's all quite exciting stuff so as mentioned, another option you have is to visit a nation. I offer these broad\u00a0recommendations based on how things are at present.Helmfirth\u00a0was created yesterday, and its theme is- as I understand it, 'dark.' Darkness and vampires and pirates and other, unnamed... unsavory sorts. I haven't read many posts there yet, so I can't speak to it with much detail, but there's often a burst of activity in a given place immediately following its creation.If you'd like to do feudal-Japan-ish sorts of things, with samurai and clans and Diayamios and such, they have that in Tawakoshi. Make sure to visit one of the active portions of Tawakoshi if you do.\u00a0And if you wouldn't like to do either of those sorts of things, I recommend The Isran Empire. Now, full disclosure, I'm biased,\u00a0as I am The Empress- I'm in charge of the setting, but it's still a good option outside of my own bias. The City of Isra- The Free City, is the largest city on TFS. It's the most populated, the oldest in real time, and I like to think I do a good job of managing it. You can read more about all nations over on the Government board, but the gist of Isra is such that it was founded as a small city-state but has since grown massively to control not just the territory immediately surrounding it, but other sovereign\u00a0nations as well. Lots of different\u00a0characters live there, and there are all sorts of shops and Inns and whatnot, so if you'd like to start slow or base your character in a good spot, Isra is it.And even further beyond that- if you just holler in chat, asking if anyone would like to do a scene, odds are you'll get a good response. The choice is yours, and I expect it will turn out well.Beyond that particular question, if you have any others, I would encourage you to ask. Ask here, ask in the shoutbox, ask me directly; however you like, but there's a terribly helpful community here, and you should take advantage of it.
