While trekking the jungle past the Drekki Mountain Range she encountered humans for the first time, Bandon Lorik and his expedition team. They were from Eight Star Explorations and they wanted to explore places that are currently unmapped. At some point while with the expedition, Rani acquired linen clothing to replace her leaves that she wore.The Lost Forest:When she left the Traakas Jungle she encountered a old sage that told her of a danger in The Lost Forest. She accepted the quest and met a band of people from different walks of life and each with a different set of morals. When they found the Nati Loa, Rani found out too late that the elements didn't want her to kill it, she spoke out to stop attacking it but she was unsuccesful. She couldn't help the creature but received a gift from it as thanks for mourning it. She'd never seen an infant Loa or any Loa in person, let alone see one die, it made her very sad and angry.Stone Cottage:Rani would seek answers from the old sage, she decided to forgive him when he explained things to her and she received her Flameburst Gauntlet as a reward along with everyone elses rewards. After this she was sent to the Free City to find a mysterious traveler, she'd never seen a city like this and there were so many humans and other non-troll races, she really felt like a stranger there but she her new companions there to make things easier for her.The Salty Seadoge:They were sent on another quest to go to the island of Darastrix to find some dragons. Rani has a bad feeling about the Traveler, but decides to go so the others don't get themselves killed. Rani had never seen the ocean and was amazed, while waiting for the chartered ship to get ready to leave Ranijarashi came across a chunk of driftwood that she would take and make into a small totem, saying it was a gift from the water elemental. When the Salty Seadog was taken contol of by pirates she didn't bother interacting them since they were going to head the direction they needed to go regardless.", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/426/traakas-jungle", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/461/lost-forest-east-phoenix-state", "", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/board/94/free-city", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/512/all-aboard-salty-seadog"], "image_list": [], "html": "<a href=\"http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/426/traakas-jungle\" rel=\"norewrite\" target=\"_blank\">Traakas Jungle</a>"}, "post-7807": {"user": "Aia Heijra", "user_num": 511, "timestamp": "1440945053000", "message": "Aia HeijraEastern River Crossing, Part IEastern River Crossing, Part IIEastern River Crossing, Part IIIEastern River Crossing, Part IVGate of the Citadel, Part IGate of the Citadel, Part IIThe Keep Hall, Part IThe Keep Hall, Part IIThe Keep Hall, Part IIIThe Keep Hall, Part IVThe Keep Hall, Part VVaran Encampment, Part IVaran Encampment, Part IISolarian Refugee Camp, Part ISolarian Refugee Camp, Part IISolarian Refugee Camp, Part IIISolarian Refugee Camp, Part IVSolarian Refugee Camp, Part VVaran Encampment, Part IIINew Solaria, Part INew Solaria, Part IIVaran Encampment, Part IVKiraxo-Torsal Fort, Part IKiraxo-Torsal Fort, Part II", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/post/6481/thread", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/post/6489/thread", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/post/6495/thread", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/post/6503/thread", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/post/6505/thread", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/post/6511/thread", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/post/6510/thread", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/post/6532/thread", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/post/6547/thread", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/post/6571/thread", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/post/6594/thread", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/post/6636/thread", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/post/6903/thread", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/post/6904/thread", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/post/6962/thread", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/post/7001/thread", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/post/7173/thread", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/post/7702/thread", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/post/7736/thread", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/post/7741/thread", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/post/7754/thread", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/post/7801/thread", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/post/7802/thread", ""], "image_list": [], "html": "<u><b>Aia Heijra</b></u>"}, "post-7810": {"user": "Jill", "user_num": 111, "timestamp": "1440950340000", "message": "Started out from the Misty Woods, then woke up in Medan near the Scoundrel and the Sage.
