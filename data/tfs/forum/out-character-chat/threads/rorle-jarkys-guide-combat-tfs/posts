Thought some new people or people who\u2019ve never done any sort of combat could read this, so I\u2019m putting it out here. I'm hoping to try and get more players to try combat, and I'd like to give the inexperienced players a checklist they can use writing their first few posts of battle.While this is my guide, it is by no means a perfect, official, or ideal guide for all situations. It is just my, personal own guide to posting to general combat in forum RP.R- Realize. Try to see or visualize what your opponent\u2019s post may be trying to do or hinting at, through what your character sees ICly, and also what you read OOCly. Pretend to be their character. Even if at this point their recent post might be wrong, read it. Find out what is happening, and what might be coming next turn or a few turns later so you can react accordingly IC. Consider this as you and your character interpreting what \u201cyou see/sense/hear/smell.\u201dWARNING: DO NOT METAGAME, metagaming is a big no-no, and here\u2019s what it means: \u201cMetagaming is any strategy, action or method used in a game which transcends a prescribed ruleset, uses external factors to affect the game, or goes beyond the supposed limits or environment set by the game. Another definition refers to the game universe outside of the game itself.\u201d In simpler words that more accurately apply to TFS: \u201cJust because YOU as the PLAYER can read a post/response and KNOW what is happening, DOESN\u2019T mean your CHARACTER KNOWS it as well.\u201d Only React with what your character knows. O- Object. If your opponent(s) do something wrong in their post that\u2019s not feasible in your opinion or they simply misunderstood your latest post, speak up. The objective here is not to be a jerk at every turn though. If you can let something slide, let it, it\u2019s a courtesy to the other player, and hopefully in the future they may let you slide on something. Don\u2019t go to a staff member if you haven\u2019t already tried hashing out a deal with the other player(s) or requesting they edit it to \u201cso and so.\u201dR- React. Now that everything beforehand has been read or cleared up, you should start writing a post by first reacting and acknowledging everything your opponent(s) is(are) doing, and if you\u2019re unsure about their actions/intentions, ask them. Your post should start by responding to the character(s) interacting with you first, and then any reaction to the environment or setting should come next, and then finally any non-critical reactions to allies or spectators. Consider this phase as your character \u201cblocking\u201d or \u201cdodging.\u201d (Be careful not to ignore any parts of the other person\u2019s post. It may bite you in the ass later, in either an IC or OOC way.)L- Loophole or weakness. During \u201cRealize\u201d you should have read what your opponent is doing, and you\u2019ve already responded to their action, now it\u2019s time to make your own action. Read their post carefully, for your response should attempt to exploit any flaws in their defenses they have the last post or may have in the next post. Look for the metaphorical \u201cchink in the armor.\u201d Make sure you can logically perform this action, without giving your opponent a loophole or weakness of your own they may see and use themselves. (Careful not to auto-hit, use words like \u201ccould, would, should, assuming,\u201d rather than \u201cwill, cannot/can\u2019t, is\u201d to play it safe.) E- Explain. It is critical that you fool-proof your \u201cLoophole\u201d by adding as many logical reason as to: How you were able to do that action? When/Where/How far away did you do that action? Why did you perform that action? Find support from any previous posts to \u201cback up\u201d and support your attack or action on why it should work, and why the action won\u2019t be able to be countered, based on the their last post or what they might perform next post.This is a given, but an important part. Be nice.We\u2019re all people here, and people make mistakes, people have emotions and moods, so don\u2019t get upset, even if your most prized character or setting might be threatened, after all, it is a game, but our losses are permanent in this game. So if you\u2019re concerned, talk to them kindly, and they\u2019ll likely be willing to do the same back.
