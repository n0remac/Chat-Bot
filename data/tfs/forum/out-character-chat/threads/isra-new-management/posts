In this position, I intend to make large and sweeping changes to the way things work in Isra, not so much on an in-character level, but on a larger, OOC scale. I intend to expand upon the amount of inter and intra-governmental RP, politics, locations, quests, information, and basically improve everything there is to be improved.To do this, I\u2019m going to need some help. I\u2019ve already enlisted the assistance of a few individuals, but the scope of this undertaking outscales the small handful of us. Thusly, I\u2019d like to request the involvement of anyone who would like to help. Whether you\u2019ve already got a character in Isra or not, or if you\u2019d like to assist with some of the meta things, like creating maps and quests, I would appreciate any level of assistance or involvement, from anyone that would care to offer. I\u2019m rebuilding things from essentially the ground back up, and hope to create something enviable by all. If you have any level of interest in being involved with Isra, either now or in the future, at any level of involvement, please do not hesitate to contact me, either through a DM or the skype that\u2019s listed on my character profile. If you\u2019re interested in being part of what I hope to make the best nation on TFS, I invite you to get in on the ground floor.
