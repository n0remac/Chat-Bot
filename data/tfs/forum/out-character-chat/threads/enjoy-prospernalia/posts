You did a great job! The king and queen contest was a great idea, and even though I didn't make it in, the jousting contest seemed super fun. Like Kelly, I really liked anything that involved characters interacting with each other socially, and I got a huge kick out of the craziness at the game booths (the ring toss and the strength testing thing were hilarious xD).As for the voting mechanic for king and queen,\u00a0I'm just about\u00a0convinced it\u00a0might not matter at all if its limited to people actually at the festival or not. I can't pick two participants out of that thread that wouldn't have\u00a0made a fantastic\u00a0king and queen, and on that basis even a roll of random chance would have been a successful selection method. Even so, maybe limit the voting in some way next time (already looking forward to next time!) and we'll see how that works? It'll still be stupid\u00a0fun, and we'll still end up with great festival royalty, and that's an outcome I think everyone can be happy with!Thanks again Gany!

Though I only played the one, my favorite game in concept was the ring toss. This is because no matter what you rolled, you got something, and could walk away. Some candy or a cookie isn\u2019t much, no, but it\u2019s something and more than the 95% chance of playing the strongman game once and receiving nothing. To this extent, I think that games with consolation prizes like the ring toss game are good, and games with options to say, decide how many times you\u2019re going to play beforehand, might also be good, so characters who are going to sit there and play until they get a prize don\u2019t need to continue to edit their post or post 5-10 times until they roll a winning number. I don\u2019t think that either of those is particularly fun for whoever\u2019s doing it, so if the game design can minimize those cases, that would be ideal, is my opinion.Having multiple food court threads for multiple sorts of food was a good idea, as it allowed for multiple socialization scenes to progress simultaneously without taking place in the same thread, and for characters to go from one to another. Three or four of those is probably about the right number, I think.My favorite contest was the King & Queen contest, right up until the point where the votes got massively skewed. I can\u2019t say how to fix that or make it fair, as some players simply have more characters and energy than others, and it wouldn\u2019t help much to say something such as \u201cYou can\u2019t vote for your own characters\u201d or something like that. However, what I do mean to say is that I as a player am not too terribly interested in the dice contests; that\u2019s just me. They\u2019re interesting, sure, but I\u2019m not personally one for participating. I would suggest keeping contests that are not dice-based in events, that might instead challenge a player\u2019s writing skill, a character\u2019s ability to tell a story, or some other non-dice, non-combat sort of thing. For example, the Land Tillers\u2019 State hosted this Food Festival last year. That was neat. And then they also invited over some warrior, mage, fighter, sorts of people, to tell stories to their soldiers, a few of which can be read here. You could probably do something with a few appointed judges, and have characters perform something, or present something of theirs for review. That would prevent voting problems, at least.I think the feast should have started one day later. Timing these sorts of things is going to be difficult, and this is just sort of my opinion, in that I woke up one morning and saw the feast, where I expected at least one more day of festival first, but I think one day more before the final thing starts, but more or less the same overall length is good. It\u2019ll depend a lot on each event, though, and I don\u2019t think you should look at how long this was, and apply it verbatim to the next one.The number of threads was good. You could perhaps do more, but I wouldn\u2019t do any less. There were frequently multiple scenes taking place at multiple times within the same thread, and I think allowing the space to keep that sort of thing to a comfortable minimum is a good idea.
