Could be contextual. A suggestion for life, for habits, for an activity to start or to stop, or perhaps something just as simple as a movie recommendation. What is it? And then, why? Elaborate on it some. If you have more than just the one, have at it, but I feel as if making a list would diminish the value of it all.

I would implore each of you to look into the topic.I would like to add to remember all the security links on your accounts. Is your main email linked to another email for security purposes that you forgot about and has a weak password? Where possible, use security links that are difficult to exploit - such as your phone number for text messages; but always have more than one. I lost access to an account last year because I had an authentication app on my phone and then broke my phone. A good idea is to have your mobile phone and your house phone as security back-ups and if the service offers you some sort of un-redeemable recovery code that you can use to get temporary, one-time access back into your account, then write it down somewhere safe and don't lose it.Make sure never to store passwords in plain text files on your PC.

But I think a lot of people are jaded to these messages for this reason.You are your brain. You are only aware of a small portion of what it is and what it does, and the decisions you feel authorship over are, in reality, predetermined by subconscious regions of that brain. Not entirely sure what this means for free will, but I can draw one conclusion: if you want to improve yourself and your life, and you're having a hard time \"just doing it\" like those motivational posters say, make sure you are eating good food, getting enough rest, exercising frequently if possible, and immersing yourself in novel situations in life. These are all essential for maintaining optimal brain health, which is \"secretly\" one of the greatest factors to your quality of life and the \"luck\" you feel you have in it. If we're actually in less control than our own brains lead us to believe, then sometimes the best way to try to take any control at all is in taking control of that brain. It's an exhaustive subject, but frequently when people are having systemic troubles with life, they're looking to specific things within their life as culprits, which the reality is that they might not be getting enough rest or good enough nutrition to have a brain that is currently healthy enough to provide them with new ideas and perspectives to change things.I think this is, ironically, the core essence of having a truly internal locus of control, and in maintaining its integrity when things go south for you.Most systemic problems come back to this. If you want some manner of upward mobility in some area of your life and you don't really know how, simply trying to max out the health of the brain is a great way to start. Of all the things that people tell you all your life that we tend to ignore, the basics of being generally healthy has had the most tangible results for me.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "In my experience, the greatest and most productive thing I've learned that can be summed up into a bit of advice is also the advice that seems to be the most counter-intuitive to an advise thread and is one of the most controversial bits out there."}, "post-73424": {"user": "Badger", "user_num": 2100, "timestamp": "1506376352000", "message": "If you agree to meet a prostitute at a hotel room, it is PERFECTLY NORMAL to then just \"want to talk\" to him/her.
