As fewer of you know, I feel obligated now to roleplay more (with my colorful new avatar), and have been mulling the idea of a new nation. This nation will be similar to Gauldin in its medieval, fairytale presentation, similar to Medan in that it will have roots in its culture and language, but with all the efficiency of a well-run administration (taking some concepts from Goraia). It will be slated to try and become the next major nation, an inviting place for new people to start with the same level of activity, defense, and legitimacy as Gauldin and Isra.Reynald Armand and I have teamed up behind the scenes to bring you Kuaria, a nation started of the refugees from Medan/Goraia and other various regional actors (tribes and such, perhaps). As such it will share borders with Goraia and will probably directly north or occupy a land between Goraia and Isra (considering some content lends to the notion of there being some undefined amount of space in between the two).I am seeking volunteers for this project as of right now, and invite anyone interested to respond here in this thread. Very soon, planning will proceed to a more \"official\" stage, which may involve a pad or google docs if required (though we have most of this down already!). Ideas for quests and events are as valuable as the creation and commitment of characters to our cause--our mission is to play the role of \"nation\" as defined by Sara and our ruleset, to the best of our abilities (so its creation is to provide a hub of activity, as opposed to furthering our IC lore). We therefore want a strong focus on the creation of events, locations, and quests for players, interact a lot with other nations, and run our nation effectively OOCly.While I might not be playing the role of this nation's \"leader,\" I at least intend to move my character Garo from Isra to this new location, to help further populate it.Please comment below!", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/833/number-harrigate-road"], "image_list": [], "html": "So as many of you know, Moon colored in my profile and I"}, "post-28611": {"user": "Eloria Tyrins", "user_num": 1158, "timestamp": "1457987289000", "message": "I've been looking for something to do with this character, so count her in.
