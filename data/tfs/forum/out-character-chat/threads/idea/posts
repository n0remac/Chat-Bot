Each factions land will be rich in specific resources and other resources will need to be traded for or pillaged. Each faction will have to have a clear cut list of units they can purchase and a solid list of what they've purchased and those troops disposition. Additionally, each factions total point value would directly relate to the number of characters that have sworn direct fealty to the lord and agreed to serve within the army, rather than just if that character supposedly\u00a0lives in that factions land. I would also ask a that there be a moratorium\u00a0on alts\u00a0within the nation so a single faction doesn't just make themselves a bunch of characters\u00a0have them swear loyalty and then try for the takeover. Also, there should be no OP setting defenses outside of maybe around the island itself to keep outside interference to a minimum. Other than that I'd like to as a group agrees to some rules on how things like spies and stuff will work to keep things fair. I already have ideas for rules but before I start finalizing things and talking about them I'd like to see if I can even get enough interested parties to join in as Warlords. As a warlord you would have to have a description for your faction, both their culture and lands and you'd be in charge of the troop lists.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "I have an idea to create a new nation but instead of a centralized government, each of the core five players will be head of a different faction within the nation.

Also to clarify a question I received, there is no preconceived set up for each faction. Your faction can be whatever you want it to be should you wish to sign on for this little experiment. Essentially, you will be in control of your own mini-nation. Also to make it a bit clearer, this is meant to appeal to those of you who like games like crusader kings. I am aiming to create an RP where relationships between nations, control of resources, and army dispositions and tactics are actually important. Most nations just claim to be self-sufficient so trade is mostly meaningless and for show and the only war we have had recently was so laughably one-sided there really wasn't a point. Hell, with setting defenses there really isn't a point. So basically if you want to actually run a nation with some real risk and real forethought, strategy, and planning involved, that is what I am trying to make.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Just an update on this and to give it a bit of a bump, I only need one more to start pursuing this and getting it set up in earnest.

So far as more in depth information and idea sharing that will likely be done through skype or a piratepad once I get a third. If you are curious about the kind of factions that will be present so far one will be a dictatorship ruled by a god-king, the other will be more traditionally medieval with a lean towards commerce. Not a lot to go on so far I know, but like I said in my initial post I want to develop the rules of the nations as a group so we can all agree on them, though I have been drafting some general rules already.", "link_list": ["/user/2085"], "image_list": [], "html": "<span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-2085 group-0\" href=\"/user/2085\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@silvercloud\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Silver Cloud Yin</span></a></span>"}}
