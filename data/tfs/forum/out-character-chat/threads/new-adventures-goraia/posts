Many coveted this land without seeing the true beauty that gave it life. And so they came: warrior, mages, dragons.

The shadow of an idea stretches to nothingness as fires burn across the horizon. War pushes from the north like a cold wind. To the west old feelings of revenge burn anew. Theses are the darkest days of Goraia. Will the lush lands of Medan survive to see another age of beauty? \u00a0Or will war push the world to the brink of another cataclysm? \u00a0Only you can decide.This rp will be open to anyone. I have tried to incorporate bits of TFS lore I have picked in my time here while also developing the backstory of some of my other characters. I hope it will be a fun experience. Interested parties can make their way to\u00a0Silvis\u00a0or may message me for more info.", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/2391/silvis-ar-alma?page=1&scrollTo=60013"], "image_list": [], "html": "In the early years Medan was the jewel of the Overworld.
