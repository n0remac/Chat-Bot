While the group we had were all for world building and coming up with the workings of a fictional government, only two of us stayed behind to man the ship. While I was contemplating trying to run this behemoth I've decided to take action to reduce it to a manageable size.Some of you may be asking how? After conversing with the Admin I've decided to do a pseudo time skip of sorts. All topics which have taken place and are still taking place will have happened a currently unknown amount of time, probably between 1-3 years before the current time of the site. I will be working to see all open topics through to the end however and I apologize for any inconvenience or confusion I have put upon you.\u00a0I will be writing, in detail, the events that transpired during the fall of the Solarian Assembly.But Medsy what will happen to the Assembly?Well, to summarize, a string of events will spell the rise of the slave races, mainly orcs (think LOTR orcs meet worg riding nomads) and Underlings (think Drowish), along with the untimely demise of most of the Solaris family, resulting in massive Solarian losses and huge amounts of refugees leaving Solaria as it would now be known as, formerly Solarian Assembly Territory. What small numbers remain will cling to Antermurale, the last remaining bastion of humanity in Solaria attempting to survive in the now hostile lands. RP in Solaria will revolve around the factions battling for survival and power in the ruins of the once great civilization in a wide spread but skirmish sized campaign. If any government or group wishes to join the fight for Solaria swing me a PM and we can discuss a way to work you and your faction into the time change lore to get the ball rolling.Ill be working on the change/update for the next few days but as always if you have any questions or queries add me on skype @ Medsy59.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "...
