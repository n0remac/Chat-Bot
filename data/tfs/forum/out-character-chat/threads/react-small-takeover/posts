What the hell is Father going to DO when it arrives at a village?  xDI mean let's pretend the author doesn't go for it, its as simple as going \"Father wants the people to begin baking delicious cupcakes with pink butter-cr\u00e8me frosting.. But they don't.\" Aren't we done at that point? lolSure he's a tentacle monster (or something?) and might rip up the place, but that's not at all like the hivemind idea. No delicious cupcakes with pink butter-cr\u00e8me frosting are going to get made if he breaks down all the houses! None! No one is going to be confused as to why they have the overpowering desire to make small, individually-sized bites of warm, fluffy cake with pink butter-cr\u00e8me frosting!
