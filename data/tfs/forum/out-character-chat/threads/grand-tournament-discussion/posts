If you think about it for even a moment, the sheer scale of problems that could accompany a competition of magical violence would spell (har har) disaster for spectators, unless the place was super warded (which I suppose is possible under Sandbox rules but still).

Think medieval tournament, when kings sent their best knights to the joust.How is this going to be judged? I think a small panel of judges (2-3 judges) will be necessary. Because \"physics\" are processed as somewhat \"realistic\" in the sandbox, judgement should be fairly straightforward and consistent with who's swing or block is most plausible.First-blood victory conditions would do well in both exposing the best fighter in most scenarios, and keeping matches from getting too drawn out.I'd allow warriors to come equipped with any weapon(s) they'd like. Perhaps put a restriction on armor to force skill-at-arms as the ultimate equalizer. Otherwise, we might have to think about weight/armor divisions, which would just send the whole concept downhill.I think if it was set up exactly like this, it would achieve all the goals we'd want out of it (see which fighter is the best fighter, while keeping conditions fair, while also being interesting to watch!).If it's set up like this, there's people I know who weren't too excited about the Sandbox when I told them, but I know would love to sign up if there's an actual awesome event they can partake in to help initiate them into our world (muahaha).--Edit: specifically I do not so much like the OOC judgement portion on how well the RP is done. I think simply figuring who is the best fighter would be more constructive, since PvP in the sandbox isn't as collaborative as they might be in tabletop games, newer players could always refer to the tournament to learn the strategies and techniques of the best, which serves an OOC purpose even from IC judgement, and also helps newbies (who perhaps may not be used to \"actual\" PvP) learn how to write PvP scenes in which the opponent is actually trying to win.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "No magic is definitely not a flaw.
