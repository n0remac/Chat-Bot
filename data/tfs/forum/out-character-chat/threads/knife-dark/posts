{"post-67210": {"user": "Silas", "user_num": 139, "timestamp": "1495180984000", "message": "Hello fellow players,Thanks to Naoki's wonderful survey I have come up with a new rp that I have tried to gear towards everyone in the survey.With the death of the tyrant that once ruled the land the remaining government\u00a0officials, royal families, and military leaders and in \"debate\" for control of the kingdom. Members of each faction have hired bodyguards, soldier, and politicians from all across the Overworld to help them win the throne. On top of the political drama, a series of natural disasters are plaguing the land.The game will allow players to use preexisting\u00a0characters. You must also play the aspiring monarch who hired you. You can do this with your original character or create a separate account. In order to stick to continuity, I would like to use a thread from the Histories. Vaac\u00a0Berheemius\u00a0is of particular interest to me for some of my characters have business in the\u00a0Valheecius Desert.\u00a0Special rules:1. Players get 100 npcs2. Each play only needs to wait for one post in order to post again.3. One player may play a vampire(this is a secret, message me)Rule 2 is in place because I believe that political conniving should be subtle and well planned. Active players will have an advantage, but if they move too fast the slower players can gain up.\u00a0The natural disasters noted above are in place to discourage power playing. OOC know that the whole city will be likely destroyed by nature itself, so victory can only be bittersweet. \u00a0Players looking for a more casual rp\u00a0are welcome to join Trogdors\u00a0quest to retrieve his lost hoard.If you would like to help or have any questions, please message me.Lastly, gems may be involved;)", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/317/vauc-berheemius", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/281/post-second-valheecius-desert", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1363/using-player-characters-npcs-extras"], "image_list": [], "html": "Hello fellow players,"}, "post-67242": {"user": "Sasha Pierce", "user_num": 2292, "timestamp": "1495217926000", "message": "Wait, so.. the kingdom is doomed to fail anyway?", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Wait, so.. the kingdom is doomed to fail anyway?"}, "post-67244": {"user": "Trogdor", "user_num": 145, "timestamp": "1495218933000", "message": "Maybe, maybe not.

I also like the desert dystopia setting that Vacc Berheemius offers.Also, because I had a little involvement with the Pheonix State in the past, I have a few lore ideas that will integrate well with existing storylines. The problem Zaltos, and many players, have is that too much background history is attempted to be created.  History is far less important in a sandbox setting. It is the past of the players that needs to be explored by the GM and players, not the players exploring a thread. In nonsandbox sites a complete history with lots of lore is important, but I feel that players preconceptions of the Phoenix State will be enough to create the dark setting I am looking for.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "I only wish to bring back two threads.
