Title: Taco Tuesday's Taco Tips!Edition Number: 354Original Release Date:\u00a0 Week of 27 March 2017This week in This Week in Taco! we explore tips to improve your taco eating, examining technique in both construction and consumption. Here is:Taco Tuesday\u2019s Taco Tips!Just the tip, and only for a second!- Ordering ground beef on a taco is an EXPERT ONLY maneuver. If you are inexperienced with the ground beef, it\u2019ll all just fall out of the taco and you\u2019ll have to endure the faux pa of eating a taco with a fork . Es no bueno!- If you insist upon going expert mode despite potential inexperience, or are served overstuffed tacos, eat your tacos over a tortilla. When you\u2019re done with the taco, the fillings falling out of the first one make another taco in your plate! You\u2019ve got another taco ready to go!- Small tacos are best tacos! If you have smaller tacos, you can eat MORE tacos. Number is really all that matters on Taco Tuesday.- Do not overlook the taco as a breakfast item! Eggs, sausage, bacon, cheese, and potatoes are all great taco fodder. It is for this reason you have no excuse not to eat tacos a minimum of three times daily.- Tacos can be a very classy food. Occasionally consider dressing in your Taco Tuesday best to go and eat tacos at your local taco dispensary! You\u2019ll be amazed at how much better tacos taste when you\u2019re wolfing them down dressed like its Valentine\u2019s Day and you have a significant other with extremely high wardrobe expectations.- When your evening out for tacos with friends eventually devolves into the requisite taco-eating contest (and it will), go for soft tacos rather than hard. The last thing you want when you\u2019re really throwing down at the Pump N\u2019 Munch is having to chew your food. Just take your tie off first.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/ovGhPok.png"], "html": "<p align=\"left\">Hello and Happy Taco Tuesday to all you wonderful denizens of TFS, or 'Taco Free Saturdays' as I am informed you prefer to be called.</p>"}}
