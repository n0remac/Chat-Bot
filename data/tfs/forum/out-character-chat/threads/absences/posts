I bought a new PC and Total War: Attila, and I might be on it a while, so I wanted to throw a heads-up.In other news, I got some interesting ideas while playing Attila.  My Brothers (of the Sword) will finish up their battle against the Wickans in the Teutonic State soon I would hope, and things will settle down there for a while (Konrad will be building a new castle there, and Grand General Vykas will be licking the wounds of his defeat and rebuilding a bigger, better, more advanced army.  This is an excuse for me to press pause on the Brotherhood's story for now.Once all of that is stalled, I will focus on my Varan, and Asgeir, and will start focusing more on the characters Ralf, Aesa, King Borg, Vylo, and some others, which I will introduce later.  Anyway, Asgeir grows increasingly cold, and the land is becoming more and more inhospitable.  Whole regions must be abandoned for no one can properly live there.  The food is scarce and the livestock freeze in their pens and cages.  The Varan have recently settled in the Free Plains under the allowance of Lord Ildessias, and are currently seeking to found a new settlement in the lands of Gauldin; that's all well and good for now.However, once all of Asgeir is consumed by the cold, the entire race of Varan must be forced to migrate, or freeze to death!  So expect hordes of nomadic northmen coming down from Asgeir, arriving at your doorsteps - whether you like it or not.  They seek new land on which to farm, raise their families, and seek employment as warriors and laborers.  But some Varan will bow to no one but the High King, and so you may see some conflicts arise between the newly-settled Varan and your own people.  The laws of your land, your taxes, your regulations, your commands and orders - to the Varan, it does not matter; they follow their own code, and you must deal with it in peace, or you must take action and force them off your land!", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Oi, friends, brothers, and sisters!"}, "post-19712": {"user": "Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui", "user_num": 102, "timestamp": "1451017599000", "message": "blargh *insert family Christmas shit* I hope 2 be back by the 27th, see ya round!", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "blargh *insert family Christmas shit* I hope 2 be back by the 27th, see ya round!"}, "post-19966": {"user": "Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui", "user_num": 102, "timestamp": "1451404541000", "message": "Alright, I'm back.
