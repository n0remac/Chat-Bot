If you want, I also recommend you make some form of IC post in advance and let people know that you are open for interactions using this thread. However, you can also just wait for others to reply and a partner/group to write with before starting IC content.\u00a0For anything more elaborate, such as if you are a GM and have an entire plotline planned, you might wish to refer to the quest board instead.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "If you are looking for RP but don't fancy joining a quest that might require planning or long-term commitment, feel free to check this thread.
