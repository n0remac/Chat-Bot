Two of us made little underwater creatures (who's foray onto dry land is still ongoing) and I for one rather enjoy playing along with the idea!Winding up my little preamble here, I'd like to invite any and all interested parties to discuss or even make your own underwater creatures to populate our own little underwater kingdom(s)! \u00a0 Also, if underwater creature drama isn't your thing, it would be nice to see land dwellers returning to the Open Seas in the form of populated islands, ships (maybe even of the pirate variety?), and thus of the like.I was inspired to write a little sermon as a priest type of character (for lack of a better term?), which I'd like to share with you fine and sweet smelling folks! Perhaps\u00a0it'll give you an idea of where I'm at with the idea, and maybe where you could go if you so chose to become a fish as well!-Badger\u201cLong after the Formless and the Divine erupted in what would be the first Great War, the world as we know it sidled into existence; an aftershock of the violent turmoil which had created it. Aldea - victor of the Great War, Mother to whom we owe our very creation - looked upon this strange and promising new world with favor, and wove a planet of light and majesty for its inhabitants. Aldea, boundless in her generosity, held our world in the warmth and safety of her bosom for years beyond reckoning.In time, empires arose.\u00a0Man arose, and claimed the land and sky as their own! Aldea would find those to whom she\u2019d given so much to be tenacious in their greed, resolute in their pridefulness, and unflinching in their savage cruelty; to her and to one-another. Torture, slavery, and fear replaced the shining glory that was our Mother\u2019s grace and favor.It was only when she could stand it no longer that she turned her back on our world, looking upon our ancestors with the distain they had earned. Aldea fractured the land she\u2019d molded for man, and the seas were born. Even in the fury of our Mother\u2019s rage, she took pity on a precious few, refusing even then to turn a blind eye to those who would reach to her for help and kindness. To these few, she offered one last chance for redemption. It was these few who would be offered the oceans, and only these who would escape being cast in shadow as a land-dweller.Our Mother provides.\u201d", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["//storage.proboards.com/6046952/images/5AgYdAfn8rATue75bHkc.png", "http://i.imgur.com/dp8hiyi.jpg"], "html": "<p>Hello and Happy (belated) Taco Tuesday to all you wonderful denizens of TFS!</p>"}, "post-62738": {"user": "Marcarus Spinneret Mindfang", "user_num": 554, "timestamp": "1491961639000", "message": "I'd be up for the piracy side of things.
