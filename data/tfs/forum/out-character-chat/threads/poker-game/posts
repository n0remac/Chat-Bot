It could also be done in a nation that is currently inactive. \u00a0I know people have been talking about reviving Katashima and Medan lately. This game could serve as a means to do that.As for card mechanics I have an idea that uses dice: -Each card is assigned a value, one through fifty two. \u00a0-A card is dealt by doing a roll of the total number cards. (52 the first time.)-Every time a card is dealt the total goes down one.-The next roll uses the new total.For example: The cards are arranged in the order hearts, spades, diamonds, clubs. Before any cards are dealt the 5 of spades would be number 18. \u00a0If the two of hearts(number 2) is rolled then the new total is 51 and the 5 of spades is now number 17.Any one interested in this?", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Who would be interested in meeting up and playing Texas Hold'em? \u00a0I thought the Midnight Sun, in the Free City would be a good place to have it. \u00a0I have not talked to the owner of the \u00a0establishment yet as I have just had this idea.
