Should I include any of the MANY MANY dead nations, most of which has no chance of returning to activity, such as the Phoenix State and the Republic of Atlanticus.\u00a0More importantly if we decide to, in a turn of phrase, burn the history books; what do we keep? The many random nations that have come and gone have cluttered the map intensely and often gave little thought to their borders and possible neighboring nations.\u00a0I personally am of a mind to do away with most of the archived nation's \"claimed land\" in order to leave room for new and more permanent nations to take root. Also from a map making perspective, it is much easier to deal with only the current nations but I'll try to be flexible.\u00a0NOTE, I messed up on the poll. The 1st answer is not an answer, please do not select it.

My quest is currently taking place in the remnants of the Phoenix State. I will probably explore more of it later, but I don't imagine anyone else doing so. Some day I will revive other dead places, like the Forgotten Usque. I say make a map only for the nations that you are going to trade between and then, keep in mind that there may be some presidence for another area to spring up in-between the borders, or close to it.  For example the Phoenix State use to be in-between Isra and the Tillers Expanse, but now it is north of both those areas. I imagine the Usque to be a huge forest that encompasses much of the Medan region and open world, but other people see it as being smaller.  Maps are great but they shouldn't be expected to always be true. The archived nations definitely shouldn't be just done away with because they are part of the history. That doesn't mean that someone can't move them around and claim the geological places they use to inhabit. The changing landscape is one of the mythological and fantastical part of the Overworld.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "I think there should be no concrete map.

Sounds like a lot of hard work, so good on you for doing that. My thoughts on what to include are that if the place is still relevant it should go on the map. For example, there are a lot of characters around whose origins are from Gauldin and Katashima (possibly others as well) and that they are referenced a lot in RP. I know those two countries are supposed to still exist just have fallen into internal conflict, so keeping things like that around makes the most sense to me. However ultimately its up to you since this seems like a really complicated thing and a labour of love. But that's my tuppence worth.
