But, as I type this, I cannot help but think of all the creative people we have here on TFS. Hell RPing is kind of a creative outlet unto itself, so its not surprising that I've already seen some great writings, drawings, and other creations made by the members of our own little\u00a0community.So please! As I post pictures of my Orkies, do feel free to throw up your drawings, songs, poems,\u00a0stories, Deviant Art accounts, or anything else you do! Whatever it is, however you scratch that creative itch, as long as you had fun doing it I'd love to see it.Thank you, and may your tacos be filled with tasty goodness!Badger", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<p>Hello\u00a0and a very Happy Taco Tuesday to you lovely and well-groomed denizens of Taco Free Saturday!</p>"}, "post-62450": {"user": "Badger", "user_num": 2100, "timestamp": "1491432707000", "message": "", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/3gt0mIF.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/3gt0mIF.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}, "post-62462": {"user": "Skarlet", "user_num": 257, "timestamp": "1491443826000", "message": "", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/UbyqMgY.jpg?1"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/UbyqMgY.jpg?1\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}, "post-62478": {"user": "Badger", "user_num": 2100, "timestamp": "1491470885000", "message": "Skarlet Man I love that hoodie the girl is wearing! xD", "link_list": ["/user/257"], "image_list": [], "html": "<span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-257 group-0\" href=\"/user/257\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@skarlet\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Skarlet</span></a></span>"}, "post-62507": {"user": "Kelt the Gael", "user_num": 899, "timestamp": "1491513552000", "message": "Hmm, those look nice Badger, but I can't help but think Blood Knights are suppose to be red and on undead horses.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Hmm, those look nice Badger, but I can't help but think Blood Knights are suppose to be red and on undead horses."}, "post-62510": {"user": "Badger", "user_num": 2100, "timestamp": "1491514352000", "message": "lmao  xD  He said 'Blood Knights' again!
