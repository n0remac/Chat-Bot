{"post-28930": {"user": "The White Wolf", "user_num": 981, "timestamp": "1458166249000", "message": "I plan to host a Fantasy Sandbox HeroScape game.\u00a0 For anyone wishing to enter, please post your character cards here.\u00a0 In HeroScape, players take turns moving their character around a hex-based map, and they had the opportunity to attack another character if they were within range.\u00a0 Attack/defense was measured using attack and defense dice.\u00a0 Heroes had more than one vitality, and so could survive multiple wounds, while Squads only had 1 life; for now, however, we're only going to focus on Heroes.\u00a0 Each character also had special, unique powers, a max of about 3-4, but some only had 1 or 2, that gave them specific advantages over their opponents.Name: Your Heroes name.\u00a0 Right now, I would very much prefer you to use a character you play as on TFS, but I will not disallow other characters.Life:\u00a0 Your characters vitality.\u00a0 Decent Heroes had 5 life; however, if you feel your character deserves more, feel free to give them more.\u00a0 9 is the max, and that would mean that character is extremely powerful.Move:\u00a0 Most Heroes typically had 5 move; this is how many spaces you are allowed to move per turn.\u00a0 Armored characters who had more defense may have had 4 move, and quicker characters had 6 or more.\u00a0 9 is the max, but that would mean you are super fast.Range:\u00a0 The max range is 9, but such a thing was usually reserved for highly skilled archers and snipers.\u00a0 Typical archers may have had 5-7 range.\u00a0 All melee characters had 1 range.\u00a0 Characters within 1 range of each other (adjacent) were considered 'engaged'; characters who tried to leave engagement suffered the possibility of being attacked without being able to defend.Attack:\u00a0 How many attack dice you roll when you try to attack someone.\u00a0 I think Heroes had an average of 4-5 attack, but powerful characters had even more than that.Defense:\u00a0 How many defense dice you roll when you defend against an attack.\u00a0 Most heroes had 4-5 defense, with the more powerful characters having more.Special AbilitiesEach character had special abilities.\u00a0 Please look at the Special Abilities section down below for more information.\u00a0 Choose 1-2 special abilities (for now) that fits your character.Name:\u00a0 Ralf ValgardLife:\u00a0 5 (I gave Ralf 5 life because he's a pretty average Heroic unit)Move:\u00a0 5\u00a0 (I gave Ralf 5 move because that's average, and he doesn't have heavy armor weighing him down)Range:\u00a0 1\u00a0 (Ralf is a swordsmen, so 1 range is what melee characters use)Attack:\u00a0 4\u00a0 (Ralf is a decent swordsmen, so 4 is adequate for him)Defense:\u00a0 5\u00a0 (Ralf is a defensive fighter, and he specializes with the use of a shield, so 5 defense is good for him)Special Abilities-----Varan Honor:\u00a0 If an opposing character is adjacent to Ralf, they must attack him.-----Hirhanic Shield:\u00a0 After successfully defending against an adjacent character, any excess shields rolled count as automatic hits on the attacker.Special AbilitiesSpecial abilities were unique skills and abilities a character had.\u00a0 Some abilities enhanced other characters (granting adjacent characters additional move, range, defense, and attack, or healing), while some abilities allowed them to 'break the rules' (flying, disengagement, avoiding ranged attacks, etc), and some were just special attacks (special attacks are different than normal attacks for certain reasons, but I won't go into them this early).Auras:\u00a0 An aura ability granted adjacent characters additional move, range, attack, and defense.\u00a0 These abilities were usually reserved for supporting characters, who followed other characters around to enhance another character's fighting prowess.Rule-breakers:\u00a0 Characters with rule-breaking abilities allowed them to ignore rules of the game.\u00a0 For example, some characters could not be attacked by normal ranged attacks; other characters could fly (ignoring engagement rules and terrain rules); some characters forced an opponent to attack only them; some characters were allowed to attack twice per turn; some characters could roll a d20 to heal/injure/mind control characters; some characters dealt more damage to flyers, or other certain types of characters.\u00a0 If you have an idea, or aren't sure how to word something, just ask!Special Attacks:\u00a0 A 'normal attack' uses the character's default range/attack, but some characters had special attacks that changed that.\u00a0 For example, Ralf has 1 range and 4 attack, but he could have had a special attack called 'Throwing Axes' that granted him 4 range and 3 attack.\u00a0 A dragon might have 1 range and 5 attack, but might have a special fire breathing attack granting 5 range and 4 attack, with the added bonus that all characters adjacent to the target are also affected.Wave I:\u00a0 Heroes of TFSRalf Valgard", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "I plan to host a "}, "post-29796": {"user": "Jun of the Celadine", "user_num": 108, "timestamp": "1458682440000", "message": "Are you still doing this?

Place Tul-Bak-Ra on the chosen space. When Tul-Bak-Ra starts to teleport, if he is engaged he will not take any leaving engagement attacks.But we will twist it.\u00a0 Basically, instead of moving or attacking on her turn, she could teleport anywhere on the battlefield.\u00a0 There are no 'cooldowns' in HS, so she can use this as many times as she wants.\u00a0 And Jun will take no disengagement attacks.\u00a0 How is that?Resonance is okay, but she can use that all day, every day, no limits.\u00a0 But that's only two additional range and two additional attack dice.\u00a0 Jun is fine as she is, but Resonance spell seems a little redundant (especially cause 7 standard attack dice is pretty killer anyway).Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui Dagons were a big part of the game, and each one was a powerful adversary in their own right.\u00a0 Like I told Jun, no cooldowns in HS.\u00a0 Jarkoopi's 4 move is pretty balanced, and his 7 everything is pretty powerful, but we will see how it works out (I'm not gonna nerf anybody anyway).\u00a0 You don't need defense dice when moving; the only real issues there would be if he is moving and disengaging (if you're in melee with someone, and move a space, then they get a free hit on you); so basically, his dash ability would just let him move 8 spaces and NOT take disengagement penalties.\u00a0 Also, he should have the Flying ability, but I can put that in the official character post later.\u00a0 And his Roar ability will just remove 'order markers' from adjacent characters.\u00a0 Might not make sense right now, but you'll all get it later.", "link_list": ["/user/108", "/user/102"], "image_list": [], "html": "So @medsy   obviously knows what's up.
