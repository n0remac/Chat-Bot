We're always working on the present, but I'd like to work with you guys to develop the Overworld's past. Through my time here many past events have been brought up and it's always been a fun read for me to know things that happened in previous eras. The goal of this thread is to compile a record of things that have happened in the past, perhaps a few ages ago even, legends that don't add to the world's history and development but doesn't conflict with anything we have.I'd like to start with more recent events. Our current Age began more than a century ago after the previous Cataclysmic Age ended. The founding of Medan (Now Meridian) could possibly be the first major event of the current era. One city in particular, Isra is only about 7 years old.The current era is pretty much a reconstruction marked with the new countries rising to take the place of old nations that fell in the previous age or at the early stages of this one. The previous era was littered with back-to-back disasters which named it the Cataclysmic Age, this age lasted 600 years.\u00a0I will try to chronicle most of the major events that I can remember, if you remember something I forgot please tell me.Current Age (Post Cataclysm)PC 1-Founding of Medan.-Trogdor fights Fenris.PC 103 -A citadel is constructed with the help of the Phoenix State and others in the Free Planes and the Free State is founded.-Solaria is ravaged by slave rebellion and raids by Orc tribes.-Free State is officially named Isra, Solarian refugees are relocated to a slum in Isra.-Norkari emerge and skirmish with Israns.-Aaedan, a surviving Kingdom from the Cataclsym, makes first contact with the rest of the world after years in isolation.-Sanctum Imperium Ivelius has become powerful in the south of the continent, catching the attention of other nations.

The Norkari form a truce with Isra when the Phoenix Imperium mobilizes near the Norkari Mountains.-Ivelius fades into isolation.-The dragon Gravlor rampages across the land.-During the peak of Phoenix Imperium there is a massive explosion.

Where is the citadel the Pheonix State helped construct? Was it blown up by that explosion recounted later? What happened during the Undead Outbreak? What is 'Sugar Hollow'?I'm gonna keep all this super short and simple, but I'll clarify if you still have questions.The Black Tower was a long term cinstruction project that turned out to be a magical Tower construct by Isra to be a base of operations for their... more secretive officials and the like. It's pretty much a base of espionage and also a house for experimental magical devices/research, such as the Kami. thefantasysandbox.boards.net/post/35206/threadThe citadel the Phoenix state helped build was the 'core' of Isra, which is currently known as \"The Citadel\" in Isra. thefantasysandbox.boards.net/board/96/citadelThere was no logical explanation from the player on how The Phoenix State dissolved (as the owner was banned), so it's assumed something like heavy volcanic activity and big sandstorms \"broke\" it. You can find TPS under \"History.\"The undead outbreak was a sort of \"event\" that was only local to Aaedan. The creator did not wish to manage his government anymore, but he wanted to see it through and properly end it. Thus, he explained that a powerful lich was housed below the city mind controlled most of the live and deceased citizens' minds/remnants and was using them to fight anyone who had the willpower to resist it (players in this case). Aaedan is also now located under \"History.\"Sugar Hollow was a location for some of Sharky's quests, but multiple people (and dragons) showed up, and started burning/looting the place. During the burning process multiple character fought eachother. I personally had arrived just after the fighting ended and the destruction of the small town. thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/2351/sugar-hollow", "link_list": ["/post/71603/thread", "/user/2444", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/post/35206/thread", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/post/35206/thread", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/board/96/citadel", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/board/96/citadel", "/user/1187", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/2351/sugar-hollow", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/2351/sugar-hollow"], "image_list": ["//storage.proboards.com/6046952/avatar/VgfWDuYknXNlcepzIrDO.png"], "html": "<div author=\"@miroell\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/71603/thread\" timestamp=\"1502706699\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-2444\" title=\"Miroell\"><img alt=\"Miroell Avatar\" src=\"//storage.proboards.com/6046952/avatar/VgfWDuYknXNlcepzIrDO.png\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/71603/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1502706699000\" title=\"Aug 14, 2017 2:31:39 GMT -8\">Aug 14, 2017 2:31:39 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-2444 group-0\" href=\"/user/2444\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@miroell\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Miroell</span></a></span> said:</div>I have numerous questions, actually!
