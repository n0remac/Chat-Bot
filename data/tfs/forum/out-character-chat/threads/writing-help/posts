Just because a post is short doesn't mean it's bad. You're mostly here to have fun. It's a hobby. You don't get paid by word count.I write a lot because I like writing and I'm also kinda competitive. But you don't have to be that way. There's nothing wrong with keeping things short and sweet. In fact, a lot of people here try really hard, and it gets tiresome sometimes.You should only write a lot if you feel like there's more that needs to be said about your characters, or if you want your characters to actually do a lot.There are two types of details you can talk about: what a character is thinking and feeling, and what is happening around the character. It's like introspection vs. the environment. You wanna maintain a good balance. For example, if you're writing a romance scene, you can talk about how your pulse is beating faster and your palms are sweating and how the girl/guy reminds you of this or that or whatever. But at some point your character actually needs to do something, like speak or gesticulate or suddenly go for a kiss. And of course people will want details that help bring those actions to life...But remember, the person you're trying to make the most happy is ultimately you. Write details that you yourself revel in. If you prefer to keep it simple, keep it simple.I happen to like Renalt Fletcher's writing style, which is brief and humorous. Going through your posts, you don't seem like a particularly bad writer either. Don't be intimidated by people who just happen to take pleasure in being verbose.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Well, let's get one thing clear.

Read a lot. Anything, really. Books, blogs, scientific texts, comics, whatever you like. When you expose yourself to many kinds of writing, you have more to draw from when you are writing yourself.2. Keep RP:ing. This is kind of obvious, but its still extremely important to keep interacting with the other players. You'll eventually see how people react to your character's actions, and by studying how other players express their characters, you'll become better at it yourself. This should happen naturally, if you just keep at it!Also, just like Jun said, there is nothing wrong with short and to-the-point posts. Its much easier to get a rally going with the other person if you are able to condense what you want to say. However, there is nothing stopping you from writing verbosely, if you really want to. Try to imagine how your character is feeling, and convey that through their look, motions, or inner monologue. Even if its in your comfort zone to write condensely, It might be good to try something different now and then.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "I'm by no means expert, but I've noticed that there are two things that really help making your writing better:"}, "post-13806": {"user": "Jill", "user_num": 111, "timestamp": "1445114937000", "message": "The number one thing that helps me most is remembering this:Because we are roleplaying we may get into a pattern where we write third person on what our characters do, a basic explanation of \"they do this.\"This is fine because its the definition of roleplay. But it might not be the definition of great writing. If the aspect of writing is what you'd like to improve, its important to break out of the bland \"my character does this\" pattern.The problem that arises in a scene where everyone is engaged in basic \"my character does this\" writing, is that our minds then struggle somewhat to figure out what we're supposed to feel. You see, the objective of great fiction writing is immersion. That is, you want to make the reader feel like they're there. Its not enough to just lay down the facts of a characters actions if you want to be a good writer. You have to take some creative liberty in describing what emotions or vibes a characters expression has, the emotional nuances of a setting (how does this setting make one feel? How does it accomplish this?), etc. Also try to expand your vocabulary by studying the posts of better writers. Good writing is more than \"just a bunch of big words.\" The English language has tons of different ways to say the same idea, and while that frustrates some people, it actually allows us to express similar ideas in different shades of meaning.So start with that - with detail comes immersion, and only with immersion does a post become truly good.Also forgot to mention but equally important, I can't stress enough how much of my writing was developed just by watching others. Identify and study players who are good at immersion. The players I personally think are the best so far when it comes to immersion writing is Zephidel, Misty Woods, and the Mulleres.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The number one thing that helps me most is remembering this:"}, "post-14564": {"user": "Malinda", "user_num": 787, "timestamp": "1446121665000", "message": "I mostly agree with what those above me wrote, though I would like to touch a bit more on something Jill said.Oct 17, 2015 12:48:57 GMT -8 Jill said:You see, the objective of great fiction writing is immersion.
