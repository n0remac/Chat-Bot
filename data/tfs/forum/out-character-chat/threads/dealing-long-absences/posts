To my dismay, I had someone completely ignore the fact that I said I have been ill and pick up a not so savory attitude about my absence.Please do not do that. Try to understand where I am coming from in this (or anybody who put as much work into stories and helping out the admin of this site, or just people who work their asses off to create stories.) Sometimes things happen beyond our control.If someone posts an absence thread, please read the entire post thoroughly. Check the absence thread often to see whether someone was kind enough to explain anything at all.I use myself as an example.I have been very ill! I was on here full time and put a bunch of effort into GMing and creating threads and stories for you. When I say that I am sick, and even if I say \"I am going to try to post,\" or \"I am going to focus on such and such.\" If I suddenly disappear, remember the part where I said I was sick and try to understand what I might be going through. I mean exactly that I am sick.Guess what? It is not kosher to assume they simply didn't want to do it anymore or assume they didn't already attempt to find someone to step up in their absence.Please remain courteous about it. Please don't be harsh, or say some things that end up being offensive to the person who you might be irritated at because you do not know.It's not nice to open up a message only to see something nasty said just because someone chose to focus on reality over a game. Sorry, folks, but it happens. You're more than welcome to take over the task of GMing if someone doesn't come back after a certain amount of time, or you're welcome to move on. I should not have to apologize for being ill and I shouldn't have to keep explaining over and over that I am ill.Anyways, I am simply reminding people to just try and be a bit more understanding, not just of my situation, but of other peoples' situations.I have said my piece now, I hope you all have a blessed evening.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Hello everyone, I popped in to check my messages because, well, I have been preoccupied with reality.
