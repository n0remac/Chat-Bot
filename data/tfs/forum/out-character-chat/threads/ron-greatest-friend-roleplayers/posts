You don\u2019t know Ron, and if you ever met him, you wouldn\u2019t remember him.What you may remember is the last time you swung from the chandelier on the ceiling of a two-story tavern. Or maybe you held on to the rope securing that chandelier to the ceiling and cut it to use the chandelier  as a counterweight to soar into the air magnificently? You used a tapestry to swing from one part of a balcony to the other like Errol Flynn. You and your mates broke tables in a bar fight, or maybe you broke windows escaping from town guards. At one point or another, I\u2019m willing to bet you\u2019ve made one hell of a mess roleplaying! But did you ever stop to think who cleans up your mess?You know who fixes those windows? Ron. You know who reassembles those antique heavy wooden tables you smash? Ron. You know who has to climb up into the rafters of that tavern and loop up a new rope line so he can haul that heavy ass chandelier back up to the ceiling where it belongs? Ron. You know who has to put the tapestry and rigging back when your character does their best Jack Sparrow impression? Yep, Ron. Do you have ANY idea how hard it is picking EVERY SINGLE little tiny splinter of wood out of the carpet from when you smashed that one guy with a chair? Ron does.So thank you Ron! Thank you to one of the greatest unsung heroes of all of us roleplayers. You never complain, you always do your job, and you never look unfavorably upon us, even when we obviously deserve it.Please join me in offering your thanks to Ron for all he does. He\u2019s one of the good ones!", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://kenmondschein.com/Ken4.jpg"], "html": "<p align=\"left\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://kenmondschein.com/Ken4.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/></p>"}, "post-60214": {"user": "Kate Green", "user_num": 567, "timestamp": "1487034578000", "message": "Thank you for cleaning after me and Empress Naoki!
