The Phoenix State, as any land, has to change and adjust to grow with the times. There is a lot of capability within the The Phoenix State without sacrificing the lore of it.\u00a0First off, since The Phoenix State is stepping into a new age with their newly founded federal government of Phoenix Imperium, the main changes will be that The Phoenix State is still one state, but it is broken down into Provinces like Katashima, since such a thing was common in the Egyptian history. Personally, I believe there needs to be more diversity in The Phoenix State, as well as many others. Although the Provinces will be within the lore of TPS, I believe there's many players here who could bring a new twist on things.\u00a0So is there anyone that would be interested in starting a Province within The Phoenix State or playing a character within one of these Provinces? I'm looking for four Pharisees, which is what the Province leaders will be called.\u00a0This is TFS's chance to help make The Phoenix State into what it can be and change certain aspects that they do not like.Thank you.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "A lot of players from The Phoenix State have went MIA and the dynamics of a lot of characters here are different than a year ago.

I'm gonna ask the admin to put the following sub-board in the Phoenix State.Land-Tiller Protectorate\"An independent tribe consisting of several dozen clans. They've lived in isolation for hundreds of years, but recently decided to break with tradition and start making friends, beginning with the Phoenix State. Primarily agricultural, the people of the Land-Tiller's Expanse are relatively peaceful. Their knowledge of farming and ecology is second to none, and they are in the process of sharing this knowledge with the Phoenix State, Katashima, and Isra. Despite their preference for peace and penchant for diplomacy, their mounted archers and elemental mages (especially earth and water) are the stuff of legends.\"Underneath this board would go the following threads:thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/257/elders-valleythefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/439/southern-plainsthefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/666/land-tillers-state-fortress-phoenixthefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1167/necromancer-ruinsthefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/186/celadine-hillsthefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/243/draconic-graveyardLand-Tiller's Protectorate would count for 5K NPCs, but I get to decide how those NPCs are used, and typically I'd prefer using them for home defense since lore-wise the Land-Tillers are not conquerors.What do you think?", "link_list": ["", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/board/61/phoenix-state", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/board/56/katashima", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/board/63/isra", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/257/elders-valley", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/439/southern-plains", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/666/land-tillers-state-fortress-phoenix", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1167/necromancer-ruins", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/186/celadine-hills", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/243/draconic-graveyard"], "image_list": [], "html": "I think you should delete The Marine Force Capital Base and Greyhaven, since there's no activity there from other players anyways."}, "post-21669": {"user": "Highlan Chamberlain", "user_num": 932, "timestamp": "1453737563000", "message": "I'd love to be a Pharasee if my religion will be accepted, Gauldin isn't working out like I had hoped, plus it'd give me a reason to do more fun stuff with my other character.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "I'd love to be a Pharasee if my religion will be accepted, Gauldin isn't working out like I had hoped, plus it'd give me a reason to do more fun stuff with my other character."}, "post-21762": {"user": "[Phoenix] Zaltos Kiraxo", "user_num": 29, "timestamp": "1453779353000", "message": "What's the religion?", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "What's the religion?"}, "post-21899": {"user": "Land Tillers' State", "user_num": 341, "timestamp": "1453913497000", "message": "I also had an idea for a \"dreamscape\" arena where characters can fight to the death without actually fighting to the death.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "I also had an idea for a \"dreamscape\" arena where characters can fight to the death without actually fighting to the death."}, "post-21903": {"user": null, "user_num": null, "timestamp": "1453916697000", "message": "I still intend to make a province but I haven't thought of everything (or a place to put it all down).", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "I still intend to make a province but I haven't thought of everything (or a place to put it all down)."}, "post-21984": {"user": "[Phoenix] Zaltos Kiraxo", "user_num": 29, "timestamp": "1454035027000", "message": "You just put it on that link I sent you.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "You just put it on that link I sent you."}}
