It makes perfect sense, it is a logical progression. That being said you have crossed a line. What you did would have been fine if this was a novel. This is not a novel this is an RP forum. You took a players character, and forced events on them, horrible events and she barely had any recourse to deny them. You are forcing someone to RP from the perspective of a victim of rape, without getting prior consent to do so, with out communicating with the community at large. That is abhorrent to me.Currently my stance is supported by: Andraste, Enigma, and Thorok. We are all rightly appalled by what you wrote, and we have acted on those feelings. This however is not entirely fair to all of the players in Goria, so killing off the entire nation for OoC reasons, backed by flimsy IC reasons may be too harsh. That being said I will do it. This is your ultimatum: delete the post, or face the consequences. This is not a negotiation or debate, that is how it's going to be. You are severally out numbered, you won't win, and you pissed a lot of people off. Be respectful, do the right thing.
