I believe there is nothing wrong with being extremely powerful, or anything like that. I think a character that is a Mary Sue has a lot of things that are not necessary to them. Now being extremely powerful is something that is quite often unnecessary. As an example, a farmer that has reality warping powers. Whenever someone has something that they do not need.\u00a0The other thing I believe is important to asses whether something is a Mary Sue is what someone's intent for a character is. Many a time I have seen someone make a character with being superior to another race, faction or character to be their whole theme. Another horrid intention for a character is when someone makes it specifically to be unique and never to be copied, or never have a similarly to them. In a DW arpee, a guy made a Marine who was good at sneaking and stealth, despite the fact that the whole point of our group was frontal assault and such.\u00a0What do you think?\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Asking just for fun, hoping noone starts anything.\u00a0"}, "post-37979": {"user": "Whir", "user_num": 1105, "timestamp": "1463352417000", "message": "I've only recently heard the term \"Mary Sue,\" so I'm not entirely sure what it is.

Because the term originated in Star Trek fandom in the 70s, its definition nowadays has become more prolific and unclear--according to the article a Mary Sue is basically a perfect female character, usually highly idealized and full of cliches. The term Mary Sue probably has the most meaning in non-RP fiction, as the plot usually in some way aids the portrayal of her perfection. I guess in an RP scenario a Mary Sue looks like a character who is a really beautiful female who always seems to have just the right skill for the job--whatever that might be at the time.To add to Whir's question--no, a Mary Sue is dependent on having all of these perfect attributes as a part of her character design from the very beginning. Mary Sue does not have character development. She's already perfect in every way, in the author's eyes.Straight from the article:\"The prototypical Mary Sue is an original female character in a fanfic who obviously serves as an idealized version of the author mainly for the purpose of Wish Fulfillment. She's exotically beautiful, often having an unusual hair or eye color, and has a similarly cool and exotic name. She's exceptionally talented in an implausibly wide variety of areas, and may possess skills that are rare or nonexistent in the canon setting. She also lacks any realistic, or at least story-relevant, character flaws \u2014 either that or her \"flaws\" are obviously meant to be endearing.She has an unusual and dramatic Back Story. The canon protagonists are all overwhelmed with admiration for her beauty, wit, courage and other virtues, and are quick to adopt her as one of their True Companions, even characters who are usually antisocial and untrusting; if any character doesn't love her, that character gets an extremely unsympathetic portrayal. She has some sort of especially close relationship to the author's favorite canon character \u2014 their love interest, illegitimate child, never-before-mentioned sister, etc. Other than that, the canon characters are quickly reduced to awestruck cheerleaders, watching from the sidelines as Mary Sue outstrips them in their areas of expertise and solves problems that have stymied them for the entire series.\"", "link_list": ["http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue", "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue"], "image_list": [], "html": "<a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue</a></a>"}, "post-37998": {"user": null, "user_num": null, "timestamp": "1463358833000", "message": "So... a Mary Sue concept is not what we're dealing with here.
