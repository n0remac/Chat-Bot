When new players join up to TFS, one of their first comments is usually \"this is a bit overwhelming. Where should I start?\"Naturally, one of the first places they'll want to check is a \"map\" thread.This becomes a problem when the new player mistakes this map as officially endorsed or accurate to the game. This becomes an even bigger problem when retired states are still recorded on the map. Mapping retired states essentially creates big swaths of unusable land and can throw wrenches into new lore and complicate things beyond necessity.We want new players to integrate into the world as seamlessly as possible. Statistically speaking, the greatest barrier to \"new player retention\" is outdated, abandoned material that they mistakenly interact with because it was not retired from the game in a timely fashion (which kills their enthusiasm for a game that comes across as vibrant and active). Because of the necessity to make joining a streamlined process (there's more lore and \"stuff\" to TFS than traditional RPs, but you don't have to spend any time learning it before jumping in), information about the game and the world have to be presented in a very consistent way (Overworld boards, for instance, are always ordered roughly north to south, every government must have an OOC board, etc). That said, any world map would have to be as consistent as everything else, and maintained accurately and on the fly by an unofficial editor. This in and of itself has problems, particularly as the cartographer is not a staff member and has no obligation to stay.A theoretical, unofficial world map would thus have to have a consistent system to it. It is a very bad idea to record some of the retired states, but not all of them--and it is equally bad to portray all of them.My suggestion is that anyone with the time, tools, and enthusiasm to bring more maps to the game to focus more on making local maps of frequented areas or even nations.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "I have always strongly, strongly discouraged the notion of making a \"world map.\""}, "post-32512": {"user": "The Cartographer's Guild", "user_num": 1357, "timestamp": "1460304672000", "message": "While I do agree that making local maps is an excellent idea, I also feel that having a world map would be an excellent idea.

This is actually a somewhat ambitious project that I've been considering for about a week with the hope of providing a scholar/adventurer's guild of some sort that could disseminate information about the board through in-character actions.However, before I did that, I wanted to ask the world heads for, essentially, a local map of their nation. I just figured that, by providing a pre-built outline of the world map, it would take some of the work load off these people. With 20/20 hindsight I believe contacting those people individually rather than posting this as a thread, checking with you before hand and beginning with in-character interactions would have been better. I apologize for my lapse in judgement.I agree that including outdated information on the map is a questionable decision and that the map needs to be edited to expand the Open Lands  and exclude those nations that are no longer active.I think that having a world map to provide and a group of characters knowledgable about the world will make new characters more able to seamlessly integrate in.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "While I do agree that making local maps is an excellent idea, I also feel that having a world map would be an excellent idea.

(southern deer tribe). while i do agree with admin in the fact that making one would be extremely hard, i think it would definitely be possible with some time and effort. after all, travel and nation/group building is a huge of this rp, and neither are too easy without a general lay of the land.While I have to agree it would be nice to have a world map. But on a technical level it'd be near impossible to keep this accurate and up to date. The Sandbox grows and changes as we know, and because of this we would need to quickly keep this up to date. Another major problem is the different sizes or perceptions of borders.I don't see it being easily plausible.near impossible is still possible. and like i said before, it is pretty much necessary for things like trade and figuring out what nations have what lands. it has been done before by many others, in other rps, and i believe its just as possible here. some people here have already made it clear that they would be willing to maintain such a thing.", "link_list": ["/post/36024/thread", "/user/102", "/post/36020/thread", "/user/94"], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/FeTBt7m.jpg", "//storage.proboards.com/6046952/avatar/1PCP1C9BRIJAfIm0mLid.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@jarkoopi\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/36024/thread\" timestamp=\"1462273995\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-102\" title=\"Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui\"><img alt=\"Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui Avatar\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/FeTBt7m.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/36024/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1462273995000\" title=\"May 3, 2016 3:13:15 GMT -8\">May 3, 2016 3:13:15 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-102 group-0\" href=\"/user/102\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@jarkoopi\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui</span></a></span> said:</div><div author=\"@clydethestag\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/36020/thread\" timestamp=\"1462269436\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-94\" title=\"clydethestag\"><img alt=\"clydethestag Avatar\" src=\"//storage.proboards.com/6046952/avatar/1PCP1C9BRIJAfIm0mLid.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/36020/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1462269436000\" title=\"May 3, 2016 1:57:16 GMT -8\">May 3, 2016 1:57:16 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-94 group-0\" href=\"/user/94\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@clydethestag\"><span itemprop=\"name\">clydethestag</span></a></span> said:</div>even though a map may not be feasible here, due to the nature of this rp, its pretty much necessary. whether it's for knowing what city gate you need to post it, or how close is a tribe to the ocean, or where's the nearest government you can trade with. the fact that new users (even myself, when i first joined) quickly go for the map thread is proof that its something that's wanted and needed. <br><br/>not having a map has made it impossible to fill one of my goals for my tribe/state (and is one of the reasons im not nearly as active as i should be) , which is to establish trading routes and trading relationships between nations and the S.D.T.
