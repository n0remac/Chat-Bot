Therefore, they are made up of a great many parts. These parts have many useful purposes, which shall be detailed below. The main parts of a dragon are as follows:BonesOrgansMeatHideHorns and TeethWingsEggsChapter 1: Bones\tThe bones of a dragon are extremely strong, but also surprisingly light, allowing for flight. The adventurer who finds a full rib cage should count himself lucky indeed, for they are highly prized among the boat-building community. A boat built from a dragon\u2019s rib cage will be extremely difficult to sink. If one has the tools, the limbs can be carved into staffs or weapons. Blades made from dragon bone will be extremely sharp and will hold their edge, although they can chip if knocked against a stone or a similarly hard object. Thus, they should be limited to spear or arrow-heads, or fruit knives. The skull can be used as a figurehead, or mounted on a wall as an interesting conversation piece.Chapter 2: Organs\tThe organs of a dragon are mostly useless and should be discarded before they begin to smell, with some exceptions. The heart, weighing at about 10-30 pounds, is worth its weight in gold. Dragon hearts are useful for potions, and should be kept in an icebox or otherwise kept fresh. It is advisable to keep a refrigeration spell on hand if one plans to acquire a dragon heart.\tAt the base of the throat, the keen-eyed adventurer may find a mircahallin, which is used to create fire. It has a sort of a pouch full of flammable liquid, with hard strikers attatched. This liquid is also an excellent potion ingredient, but one must be careful. It is extremely dangerous, and must never be exposed to an open flame. The strikers can be used as a firestarter, and will make for a tinderbox that will be prized for generations.\tThe reproductive organs of a male dragon are said to have aphrodisiac properties, or act as a supplement for men. It is unknown whether or not these rumors are true, but many husbands and wives have reported this as working. Whether it is an actual effect or simply a placebo has yet to be revealed.Chapter 3: Meat\tDragons are large animals. Therefore, they have an enormous amount of meat. Unfortunately, this meat is rather tough, but is edible once tenderized. It tastes somewhat of chicken, and makes an excellent roast. It is a tradition for a new dragonslayer to hold a celebratory feast upon killing his first dragon, and to serve the dragon\u2019s meat as the centerpiece. If one cannot find time to tenderize the meat, it can be made into a stew, with the following recipe:Ingredients3 pounds dragon, cut into stew sized pieces1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour1/4 cup grapeseed oil3 tablespoons butter1 cup celery, diced2 cups diced carrots2 onions, finely dicedSaltFreshly ground black pepper3 bay leaves6 cups water4 cups red wine4 medium-sized potatoes, diced1/2 cup sliced sauteed mushroomsDirectionsUsing half the flour (3/4 cup) coat the pieces of dragon, shaking off any excess. Heat the oil and butter in a large heavy-bottomed saucepan, and brown the floured dragon on all sides. Add the celery, carrots, onions, salt, pepper, bay leaves, 6 cups water and red wine, and stew for about 2 hours. Add the potatoes 45 minutes into the stewing process. Once the dragon and all the vegetables are cooked, use some water to form a paste with the remaining 3/4 cup flour. Stir the flour mixture into the pot as a thickener. Add the already sauteed mushrooms to the stew and allow to simmer for about 10 minutes. Adjust seasonings, if necessary, and serve.Chapter 4: Hide\tA dragon\u2019s hide is one of the most useful parts of the beast. It makes for a strong, fireproof, waterproof leather, and a coat made from dragon\u2019s hide will deflect arrows and knives. Because of this, it is preferable to club, punch, or strange a dragon to death, as to avoid damaging the valuable hide. The scales are shiny and brightly colored, and are often ground up to be used in vibrant paints. Chapter 5: Horns and Teeth\tThe horns of a dragon are a popular potion ingredient. They can also be carved, much like ivory, into knife handles, false teeth, and other such items. If one so desires, the horns can be kept whole and mounted on a wall, to serve as a charming and functional hat rack or coat hook, as well as an excellent decoration. When removing the horns from the skull, do not cut them! This will leave ugly stumps on the skull, and lower the amount of horn you get. Instead, gather several strong friends or a local dentist and pull them out, much like you would extract a sore tooth. The teeth are all extremely sharp, and can be made into arrow-heads, although this is not advised. It is a popular habit among most dragon-slayers to keep the tooth of the first dragon they slay on a string around their neck, and to keep one tooth from each subsequent dragon as a souvenir.Chapter 6: WingsThe wings of a dragon are similar to that of a bat, with thin bone frames and a sort of webbing between. Since the wings are jointed, they are commonly used for boat sails, and can fold up easily when not in use. However, the wings of a dragon are often the first thing a new dragonslayer aims for, and are frequently damaged to the point of uselessness by the time the beast is slain.Chapter 7: EggsOccasionally, the lucky dragonslayer will stumble upon a clutch of eggs. These eggs, although difficult to obtain, are almost as useful as a full-grown dragon. They can be made into a delicious custard, and many notable food critics claim that dragon custard is the greatest dessert they\u2019ve ever had. If one is not a fan of sweet things, the eggs can be fried like a chicken\u2019s egg. It is not advisable to attempt to boil them, as it will take hours and will not cook evenly. The shells are often brightly colored, and while not particularly valuable, can be given to children as gifts. Any child would love a piece of dragon eggshell, when it is given with many wild tales of how it was obtained at great risk of life and limb.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><font size=\"5\"><b>A Brief Guide to the Many Uses of Dragons\u00a0</b></font></div>"}, "post-17114": {"user": "Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui", "user_num": 102, "timestamp": "1448583552000", "message": "You've received Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui's seal of disapproval.
