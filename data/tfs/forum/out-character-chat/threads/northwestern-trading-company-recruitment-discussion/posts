Since only you and Robert Fletcher are interested, I might let you guys accompany me (as Dorman Bovar) to the Free City, where we'll try to open up a Warehouse and Office.We currently own a warhouse in Bleakharbor (Asgeir).  Let me explain the whole trade system I'm thinking for now:Basically, trade already exists, I am sure.  However, we seek to improve/exploit it.For this exercise, assume we've already established a Warehouse and Office in the Free City.  Basically, an Asgeirian trader will no longer need to travel all the way to the Free City to trade his goods, and vice versa.  Rather, he just sells his entire load to us in Bleakharbor (for a wholesale price, of course), which we store in the Warehouse there.  We then transport multiple multiple loads to the Free City ourselves (we will hire wagon drivers and mercenaries to do this for us), which is stored in the Free City warehouse.  There, we sell those goods individually, as we will hire vendors which sell them for us in the Bazaar (and as history suggests, foreign products from Asgeir being sold in the Free City is a valuable enterprise); otherwise, we sell those goods in bulk for higher prices than we bought them for, to individual traders and merchants.We'll also seek to do this via the sea.  We seek to open more warehouses in places like Perimoore, the Phoenix State, etc...As a player, your job will be to secure these deals and participate in the negotiations, as well as act as a representative of the NTC if such a need arose.  You may be a trader.  Or a mercenary.Perhaps the city's leaders will want tax, I don't know.Bleakharbor:thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/525/bleakharbor-asgeir", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/525/bleakharbor-asgeir"], "image_list": [], "html": "You need only post in Bleakharbor for now.
