At its head is the King, behind the King is the Consort. Behind the Consort is the Magistrate and Archons. The KingThe King's first and most important duty is to protect his/her people, this includes foreign and domestic threats. The King is also responsible for diplomacy with other Kingdoms. He has final say on all laws, tax changes and wealth distribution. The King is to make sure his Kingdom is incorruptible, usually by cutting out the corrupted parts.\u00a0 The ConsortThe Consort is a group of people who answer only to the King. They have the highest military rank and are awarded their own property. Only the King can appoint people to this position. There are four key roles that every king has always filled.Spymaster: As the name suggests, this person maintains a network of spies within and without the kingdom. They offer unconventional tactics and ideas. Agents under control of the spymaster can perform assassinations or sabotage.High Magus: As there was never a Magus King in Aaedan, this member of the consort offers knowledge of the magical realm, how to defend oneself from magics and has been known to enchant the kings weapons and armor. Additionally the High Magus oversees the few magical academies in the kingdom.\u00a0 Ambassador: This particular character is usually far better at being an ambassador than the King. They maintain knowledge of the important political figures within the land and without. They offer diplomatic solutions while others see only war.High Praetor: This member of the consort steps in and leads the armies of Aaedan when the King is otherwise unavailable. In combat other members of the consort must follow his orders as though he were the King. In the meantime however, he insures soldiers are trained properly, runs drills and makes sure the army is in fighting order. The MagistrateThe Magistrate is a council of \"wise\" men, responsible for the day to day operations of the Kingdom. This includes taxes, distribution of wealth, resource management. They also advise the King about the people in the kingdom and the state of things. The only requirement for being in the Magistrate is that one must have served full military duty at some time and have been educated accordingly.The ArchonsThe are the rulers of towns. They command the local garrison for the town and as such, are responsible for the protection of the town and its people. They also facilitates the towns day to day function. The Archon is also the towns representative to the King, every Archon is informally a member of the Magistrate.\u00a0 For the most part this is an easy job, towns usually function without the direct hand of the Archon and meeting with the King or Magistrate is normally a rare thing. NotesThe Magistrate and Archons are planned to be NPCs. However, there is no problem with some one taking the role if they wanted. The Consort is meant to be filled with actual characters but if one of the 4 roles isn't filled a NPC will fill the role temporarily.

It is so entwined that every citizen knows how to use arms and often carry them. From age five every citizen, man or woman, has to go to a military academy. From this point they have 5 years of military training and basic education. Reading/writing, arithmetic and simple biology make up the basic education and is spread out over the five years. The military training includes weapons training and maintenance, tactics and formation drills. After the mandatory five years they have options open to them.

They can include soldiers from different specializations. They are more of a utility role within the army. Messengers, scouts, and raiders make up their duties.

Heavily armored on their upper legs, chest and forearms, Light armored boots, upper arms and stomach, a hooded cloak, a longsword, 25 arrows and an Aaedanian longbow make up their gear. The bow is unique to Aaedan. Its roughly 5 feet in length, 6 feet if not strung. A recurved longbow, it is made with upwards of fifty different layers of wood and lacquer and enchanted in the magic academy to hold extra strength and not break from proper use. The bow has a hundred pound draw, normal archers cannot use Aaedanian long bows.SaboteursSaboteurs are the craftsmen of the Aaedanian Armies. They make the armor every soldier wears, the weapons the soldiers wield and most importantly the siege equipment to take down walls and gates.
