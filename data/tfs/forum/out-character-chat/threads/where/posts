And if I did, 6) would there be problems with language and communication?1) Let yer creativity shine.2) Sure but getting stuff from \"other worlds\" can be fickle here. Still, if it floats your boat. The important thing is that you should still reveal your powers in your profile, and saying \"otherworldly magics\" and stuff won't work. Once again, be creative. There are all sorts of tropes/archetypes of fae/elves here, some may not be all that different.3) Sure why not, this does not even have to be a point. Why did I put a number for this? Oh right I like reading what I type.4) Gauldin seems to fit the bill. Has annexed a few islands, several coastlines, if you don't mind the fact that they are a bunch of frogs (based off of France, very unsubtly) then they seem ideal for you.5) Whatever floats your boat.6) Choice of style etc. Some people manage to speak the \"common tongue\" despite being isolated for centuries, while some have their own languages.\u00a0Hope this helps.\u00a0 ", "link_list": ["/post/41288/thread", "/user/1624"], "image_list": ["//storage.proboards.com/6046952/avatar/4z_oknZyfjddfRinyrKC.jpeg"], "html": "<div author=\"@casteylan\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/41288/thread\" timestamp=\"1465856127\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-1624\" title=\"Casteylan Redhawk\"><img alt=\"Casteylan Redhawk Avatar\" src=\"//storage.proboards.com/6046952/avatar/4z_oknZyfjddfRinyrKC.jpeg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/41288/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1465856127000\" title=\"Jun 13, 2016 14:15:27 GMT -8\">Jun 13, 2016 14:15:27 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-1624 group-0\" href=\"/user/1624\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@casteylan\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Casteylan Redhawk</span></a></span> said:</div><b><i><u>1)</u></i></b> Okay, so I have tons of backstory for my character but I am having trouble figuring out where in this Sandbox he might be from.<br><br/><b><i><u>2)</u></i></b> According to the stories I've been writing and RP'ing over the years, he's an elf and he's from a different world entirely, but the elves of his world don't seem to be a good match for the Fae here. \u00a0<br/><br/><b><i><u>3)</u></i></b> I could feasibly make him half-Fae, in which case the Fae half would be his father (who went AWOL when Cas was a child and was never seen again); this would mean that he was raised by a human mother in a largely human community.
