Everyone who can use some kind of magic is welcome. But non-wizards can also join and take on roles like administration or even start training to become a wizard.Members don't have any obligations. Just don't bring shame to the guild.Everyone is welcome to make a character and join. Only restriction: no evil alignment. You can be chaotic or whatever, but be good in your heart. Meaning: no assassination jobs or the like.Before I think about more details, I just wanted to know, if anyone would be interested.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Hello,"}, "post-33809": {"user": "Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui", "user_num": 102, "timestamp": "1461084978000", "message": "I remember there used to be a similar mage's guild, oh well.
