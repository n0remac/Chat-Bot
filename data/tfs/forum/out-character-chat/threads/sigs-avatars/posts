This includes anything pornographic in nature, as well as people in modern typed clothing and toting firearms - I don't really think this needs to be said but it's there.\u00a02) If your character picture is copyrighted to someone other than me(or if someone else wants to help?), I will not use that in your signature, but I will ask that you search through DeviantArt in the stock photography for items relevant to your character and I will work from there.\u00a03) This is first come, first serve, and I will only do one piece at a time. Please have a clear vision of what you want otherwise it will be at my mercy, and I will not redo it. I am not being paid for this, so please try to understand <3\u00a04) I will PM you the end results. From there, you are responsible on how you post them. Please do not ask me for my photobucket direct links.\u00a05) If another person chooses to hook you up, respect them the way I asked for you to respect me.Remember that each person had a different set of rules as to what they will do and such, but rule 1 and 3 are firmly in place.\u00a06) Be courteous! We don't have to do this If anybody has any photoshop experience under their belt and wishes to help out, that would be lovely!
