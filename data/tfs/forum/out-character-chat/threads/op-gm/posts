This is AFTER everything has been tried.Just because your character isn't strong enough or you can't figure out how to defeat them doesn't mean they are OP/GM.\u00a0Everything has a weakness and can be beaten. Nobody should have to tell anyone how to beat anything. It'd be like the U.S Armed Forces telling Iraq, \"Hey, we're stronger than you, but because you're weaker and lack the intelligence neccessary for battle, here's how to beat us so it's fair...even though we've trained and prepared for this.\"Everyone needs to quit crying OP and start RPing. If your character isn't capable of beating them or you can't figure out their weakness, don't try to take them head on.\u00a0This site has lost a few great RPers who used well developed characters because of this. It takescharacters on all levels to make it happen. Some will be weak and some will be hard. 95% of this issue could be solved by placing detailed posts and actually reading their post, not skimming it.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<font face=\"arial\">Since young RPers are crying everything in OP, here is what OP.<br><br/></br></font>"}, "post-9849": {"user": "Satrage", "user_num": 63, "timestamp": "1442349076000", "message": "I think this community in general tries to promote an environment where having highly powerful characters is discouraged. I know that the admin wants all levels of powers on the boards but with the majority on the lower end of the spectrum. I think the way the culture of this game is stitched, there will always be a little bit of fallout from this fact, and anyone who has highly powerful characters might be called out for being what they consider over-powered. This is especially true in player vs player scenarios.Because of that, I see the community's resistance to high powered characters as a sort of limiting mechanism on players who wield disproportionate amounts of power. Players who have great ideas and reasons behind their powers shouldn't let others convince them to quit. Leaving the game over other peoples criticisms of your power level makes you the loser, not them! This is an emergence-based sandbox, so staff policing behavior of players or anything at all for that matter, is very minimal. Nothing is sanctioned by a DM and so there will always be conflicts of plot and interests all across the board and that is part of the game. If you can't handle the friction of competition then this game might not be for you.If you want good powers for your character, I suggest you follow these golden rules:1. Never control the other person's stuff and never specify the results. Always write open-ended. Never declare absolutes even if you have high expectations of an outcome.2. Give others a chance to respond. Cast your spell in one turn and describe the effects the next if they fail to respond adequately.3. This game was obviously designed to facilitate some competition. It's going to produce a wider array of emotions than a D&D game and they're going to manifest in the chat room. If you're going to bring the heat, don't let it push you out. Don't allow yourself to get frustrated and don't quit.
