Founded by Highlord Valoria a thousand years ago, the victories claimed by the Knights have been countless throughout the time of the Vessian Empire, forging new bonds and breaking the will of nefarious enemies. The Knights are guided by Saint Michael, the patron saint of battle, and live to fight upon the field.\u00a0The Order has been through arduous times, in the lands of Swavia. The war upon the heretical and the beast has been a long fought affair, testing the patience and faith of the Order too many times to number. It appeared to the knights that when a threat was vanquished, more would stand in their place, as if battling a hydra. Though, with God upon their side, the Order is resolute in victory over the dark.The Church of The Argent HandThe Church is a hardy structure, standing since the founding of the Order. Many knights of the Order find the large ground around the Cathedral their home, buildings ranging from town homes\u00a0to shacks surround the area.The Chapel is considered hallowed ground, blessed by God and even visited by John. Most manner of nefarious beings find themselves scorched or subject to great pain once upon the ground in the immediate vicinity of the Church, another perk of being blessed. And, while it is true that men and women seem to heal faster beneath the roof of the Church, a large part should be credited to the clergy within.RanksHighlord - Supreme Commander of the Argent Hand, currently held by Arthur Mograine.Lord-Crusader - Held by five men, these devout warriors oversee various campaigns\u00a0and crusades taken by the Order, or lead sermons within the ChapelKnight-Captain - Standard officer of the Order, these warriors are standard line commanders, receiving orders directly from their superiorsKnight - The spine of the Order's fighting arm, the Knights are a distinguished class, being devout and fierce upon their steeds.Laymen - The Church\u00a0oversees and protects various civilian\u00a0institutions such as farmsteads and communities, in return being offered a place for recruitment and supplies.
