And now the Land-Tillers have their very own setting-based defense system!A TERRA portal with several spells being fired off.The Triadic Emergency Reconnaissance and Reactionary Artillery Network (or T.E.R.R.A Network for short) is a portal based defense system that allows the Land-Tiller's most potent guardians to deliver their mightiest spells where they are needed. Designed by Jun of the Celadine, Grandma, and Lord Tristian Seryl, it a true join project between the Black Tower and the Land-Tiller's people. It works by tracking and targeting potentially dangerous threats via multiple scrying devices, concealed throughout the Expanse' borders and in key areas. When a major threat is identified, the information is sent back to a hidden command center in one (or all) of three possible locations, the Land-Tiller's Black Tower Branch, the Temple of the Merciful Phoenix, and the Guardian Wizard's Tower (hence the \"triadic\" portion of the name). From there powerful mages, including Black Tower agents, the strongest members of the Elder's Council, and the priests of the Phoenix Temple, can cast their spells through one-way portals and have them hit the target on the other side. The portals are high in the sky, making them hard to reach by anti-magic. They can also conduct offensive and defensive spells. For example, the high priestess of the temple can cast a Seraphim's Seal: Chastity to automatically end any conflict and prevent any harm coming to, or from, those caught in the seal.The underground portal room.There are limitations to the T.E.R.R.A. Network. It has difficulty tracking invisible targets (at least one charge to reveal invisible targets), requires charges to fire potent spells, and can be disabled if the hidden scrying devices are found and destroyed, or if somehow the primary structures in all three IC threads are eliminated. It is also theoretically possible to use anti-magic on the scrying devices or the portal, but it is extremely difficult. Black Tower agents can also substitute their telepathy as a means to track targets in their line of sight, though this would require them to remain safe while concentrating on the target.There are also many advantages to this system. It affords the Land-Tillers a great deal of versatility, allowing them to use both offensive and defensive spells. Compared to the other setting defenses it requires much less power. It also cannot be disabled by attacking any one structure; multiple structures must be taken down in order to completely disable the network. The system can also hit multiple targets at once.", "link_list": ["/user/108", "/user/602", "/user/1222", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1627/black-tower-land-tillers-branch", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1206/temple-phoenix-mercy", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1505/wizards-guardian-tower"], "image_list": ["https://pressstart2begin.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/0ecbace65ca500f88d557cb39c8e37ac.jpg", "https://i.gyazo.com/8ba24e64f73de3286de2acc9d8a8fcdc.png"], "html": "<div align=\"left\">First there was Goraia's \"Orb of Judgement\".
