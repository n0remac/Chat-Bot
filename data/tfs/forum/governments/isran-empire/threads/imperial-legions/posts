The Free City\u2019s Military (before it was Isra) was raised and maintained under the administration of Ildesias Xen Torsal    with the ostensible goal of defending the city and its assets. In this, it did well and protected the city from several attacks. When the name of \u201cIsra\u201d was voted on, it could also be called Isra\u2019s Military, though the original name remained for official use.After Empress Naoki had been elected as Lady of the Free City, she revised many policies, many of which were pertinent to Isra\u2019s armed forces. Notably, she created Isra\u2019s Navy and expanded The Dawn Riders into a larger, independent organization. Later, after the founding of the Free States, she also removed many of the middle-ranking officers in the army, creating the structure that is used today. Upon the transition from The Free States to The Empire, further, though minor alterations were made.StructureThe Imperial Legions refers to the collection of individual Legions that form The Empire\u2019s army. Each Legion has 1,000 soldiers within it, as well as varying numbers of support personnel such as cooks, scouts, and some components of the supply chain that keeps the army in the field. Legions are then divided into cohorts of 100 soldiers. Each of these is further divided into squads; it\u2019s tens all the way down.At the head of each Legion, there is a General. They are appointed by Empress Naoki. Generals may then decide who will lead their cohorts; these are called Centurions. As one might expect, there are ten centurions in any given Legion, one for each cohort. Centurions then choose their squad leaders, their Decurions.For standardization, every soldier is a particular class. Their weapons, armor and equipment change based on what class they are. In no particular order, the classes are as follows.
