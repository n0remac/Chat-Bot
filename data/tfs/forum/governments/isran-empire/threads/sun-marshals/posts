These exceptionally skilled men and women were clandestine operatives that served the interests of their employer. Sometimes called \u2018Midnight Sun Operatives\u2019, they worked in the shadows to further her agendas, but with Madame Naoki\u2019s election, things had to change. Now that their employer is the head of state, should they serve only her interests, or those of the city as a whole? Should they continue to work in the shadows or, should they come into the light of legitimacy? Due to the abnormal sets of circumstances surrounding many of the operatives that would have made them ill-suited to serve in a traditional military body, it was decided to create a new organization for these individuals. One wherein they continue to serve Madame Naoki\u2019s interests, but from a position of considerably more authority and legitimacy. This group has been dubbed The Sun Marshals.\u201cKnowledge without power is just ivory-tower academics. Power without knowledge is simply brute force. But by their forces combined, I will shape this world to my will.\u201d~Madame Naoki, on the founding of the Sun MarshalsThe Sun Marshals are part law enforcement agency, part clandestine spy agency, part military organization. It falls on The Sun Marshals to handle situations that other government organizations are incapable of resolving, or to act as supplementary influence to those organizations. If, for example, a hostile organization has taken hostages in a building, standard soldiers and swordsmen would be ill equipped to handle such a situation without civilian casualties, lacking the necessary finesse. In this situation a Sun Marshal would be dispatched to resolve the issue. Marshals are capable and willing to do the jobs that others cannot or will not do to keep Isra safe. To that end Marshals possess a unique judiciary license and nigh-unmatched authority. This license permits them to do whatever is needed so long as it is in the line of their duty. The Marshals are only answerable to themselves, their High Marshal, and the Lady of Isra.Admission to the Sun Marshals is very exclusive, but not closed. Individuals willing to fully devote themselves to doing what needs to be done should report to the Sun Marshal Headquarters in Isra and inquire within.\u00a0Sun Marshals wear a small number of items while on duty to identify themselves and denote rank. Senior Marshals wear crimson scarves, and Junior Marshals wear white scarves. Additionally, The High Marshal wears a black silken scarf, and The Administrator wears a violet scarf.\u00a0These scarves may be worn however the individual desires, around the neck, knotted, unknotted, however. Recruit Marshals do not wear a scarf; the scarf must be earned.Additionally, all Marshals, regardless of rank, wear a badge. This badge lists the wearer's name, (or code name, as the case may be), their badge number, and has a pair of specially enchanted rubies embedded into either side.\u00a0High Marshal: Alden Marshal Administrator: Takhana Veil Senior Marshals:Emahra Untyrid Grandma Junior Marshals:Kaylie Imrahil BartholomewRecruit Marshals:Jun of the Celadine Lamina Manira Zephiros Aegon ", "link_list": ["/user/607", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1669/sun-marshal-headquarters", "/user/794", "/user/1067", "/user/1453", "/user/602", "/user/1504", "https://i.imgur.com/jHzEFmY.jpg", "/user/108", "/user/157", "/user/1552", "/user/439"], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/DVZmRak.png"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">When <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-607 group-0\" href=\"/user/607\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@madamenaoki\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Empress Naoki</span></a></span>   ascended to the position of Lady and assumed control of Isra in name, the operatives of The Midnight Sun were left in a grey area.
