Begun by William Perceval, the Company began as a family business of small-time merchants. The sea and various ports was their home, never settling for long, always searching for a better deal than the last. One frigate proudly served the families needs, but one always has grand plans to expand their influence, which is what William Perceval did, buying another two frigates, and the rights to a relatively large island to construct as the Company Headquarters.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Not long after the Trade Company was getting on its feet to compete in the market, did the large and wondrous opportunity\u00a0of Isra come into play.\u00a0 A young Arthur Perceval was just starting to galavant around the world with bright eyes when the Company began to trade with this new state. And, as the time called for, the purchasing of more ships became more necessary. A large ship, a fussock, pride of the Company Fleet, was built from the hardest of timbers and fitted with the finest of cloth. Forward Unto Victory\u00a0first sailed under the Company jack and the command of Captain Perceval.\u00a0Forward Unto Victory\u00a0 \u00a0 The ship Forward Unto Victory\u00a0was built as a testament as to how far the company had come. Large and menacing, always being refitted with the newest offensive technology, the pride of the Company Fleet is paramount to the large ego of the Perceval family.\u00a0 \u00a0 Far before Naoki came to power, more ships were built to reinforce the waters rife with piracy. A proper fleet was needed. Maritime soldiers were required. The first mercenaries were hired, and a band of soldiers, who would soon give birth to the Company Marines. Trained as sea combatants only, from boarding to defending, these Marines kept cargo and regular working sailors safe.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A merchant fleet and offensive fleet now existed under the Company banner, the latter's only goal to serve and protect the merchant fleet. The merchant fleet only consists of frigates and schooners, while the offensive ranges from large warships to sloops. A Company warship is much like the Isran Ship of the Line, being the same in every manner. The same goes for the Isran Frigate. A slight difference comes in the chain of command, where Company assets answer to the Governor of the company, now Arthur Perceval.\u00a0 \u00a0 After the creation of Port Silverion and the Imperial Navy, the longtime resident of Isra, Arthur Perceval, known for the Trading Company, brokered\u00a0a deal in the court of Isra to incorporate Company assets into the Isran Empire. Though the Company remained under the ownership of now Lord Perceval, there was no mistaking who he answered to. This also brought a change of naming. Formerly Pervecal Inc. the company has shifted to a rebranding,\u00a0The East Isran Trading Company. Now, with a new Company Headquarters within Port Silverion, most business arrangements\u00a0and meetings would be done in the harbor city.\u00a0Trade Goods\u00a0 \u00a0 The East Isran sells a variety of things, the most notable being found in the deep south of the known world, being spice leaves. Other goods range from exotic materials of rock and timber, gemstones, and dazzling drinks from far off places. The Company deals in the selling of most weapons a man, or army, would need. From foreign to domestic goods, the East Isran Company has it all.The East Isran Company Headquarters\u00a0 \u00a0 This large building is located in Port Severlion, built upon Company assets and manpower. A garrison of Company Soldiers is kept on the premise, ready to enforce the strict rules on ne'erdowells.\u00a0The Company Fleet\u00a0 \u00a0 Though large and imposing, the Company Fleet is only a defensive means for the merchant fleets. They are ready for a fight, but will not search for one. Each ship has different crew members than the regular Isran Navy.Company Sloop - 15 Marines, 20 SailorsCompany Schooner - 25 Marines, 50 SailorsCompany Frigate - 50 Marines, 100 SailorsCompany Warship - 100 Marines, 300 SailorsForward Unto Victory - 150 Marines, 350 Sailors", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.pinimg.com/originals/18/9e/1b/189e1b5d26f01ddb3f1b64c009b41093.jpg", "https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e6/fc/be/e6fcbe0428030867d4dcf46abf88f2e5.jpg", "https://www.bishopmarineart.com/gallery/historic-warship/hms-victory-antigua.gif", "https://us.123rf.com/450wm/hansenn/hansenn1706/hansenn170600001/79708443-wooden-crates-and-barrels-on-board-of-a-restored-dutch-voc-ship.jpg?ver=6", "https://cdn.theculturetrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/1136px-voc-1024x811.jpg", "https://stmed.net/sites/default/files/ship-wallpapers-32564-2108198.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><font size=\"6\"><b><u>The East Isran Trading Company</u></b></font></div>"}}
