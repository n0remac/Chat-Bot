The first branch, The Guard, concerns itself with keeping the peace within the Empire through civil and criminal law enforcement, investigating crimes, citizen surveillance, and housing suspected/known prisoners, among other related activities. Their jurisdiction is, usually, limited to within the borders of the Isran Empire and its territorial holdings.The second branch, The Courts, work to sentence known criminals, determine the appropriate levels of punishment for individual cases, and hold trials for matters civil and criminal involving Isran citizens. Non-citizens are not allowed a trial unless sponsored by an Isran citizen.This current structure of the Isran legal system stems directly from Empress Naoki\u2019s desire to professionalize the bureaucratic and internal functioning of her Empire. As the size of her state grew, so did the need for a comprehensive overhaul to the way in which its laws were kept and enforced. The result is what we see in Isra today.The Guard\u2018To serve is to protect\u2019 / \u2018Peace through security\u2019 / \u2018We are the law\u2019\u2015 Various Mottoes of The Guard\u201cIf you want to spend the rest of your life looking over your shoulder, try to break a law in Isra.\u201d\u2015 Lucius Dismas, informant for The Guard\u201cWhat sets us apart from the wildman and his savagery is our laws. We are bound to follow them to the letter in the name of peace and sanity.\u201d\u2015 Commissioner of The Guard, G. Lestrade \u201c...the real objection to that torrent of modern talk about treating crime as disease, about making prison merely a hygienic environment like a hospital, of healing sin by slow scientific methods. The fallacy of the whole thing is that evil is a matter of active choice, whereas disease is not.\u201d \u2015 G.K. Chesterton There are six different Offices within The Guard, each tasked with a different area of law enforcement. These are:The Office of InvestigationThe Office of SurveillanceThe Office of Prisons and JailsThe Office of Gatekeeping and ControlThe \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 The Office of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588The complex structure of The Guard is meant to stave off potential corruption by separating its various functions into different offices. For example, The Office of Surveillance works separately from the Office of Investigation. An investigator wishing to order surveillance of a suspect cannot go through their own supervisor, but must work through that of their partner office.The working culture within The Guard is one of utmost professionalism and duty. Any sign of slacking or misuse of power is grounds for immediate expulsion. Due to the far reaching influence of The Guard, losing your position there often leads to blacklisting for other career alternatives. Lucrative pensions and retirement options at the end of 25 years of service serve as motivators for those in The Guard to maintain a clean record. Of course, the end goal is enforcing the law and keeping the peace, not winning over hearts and minds. Brutality against suspected criminals is allowed, provided there is enough evidence to justify a Guard\u2019s actions.Regardless of Office, employees of The Guard are simply referred to as \u2018guards\u2019, or whatever their job title may be.The basic uniform of The Guard varies by Office. Both The Office of Gatekeeping and Control and The Office Prisons and Jails models their uniforms off the Imperial Army. A crimson arming doublet covered by mail hauberk, reinforced boots, and some form of helmet provide the base of the uniform for this office. Guards are free to add on to their kit as they see fit, so long as the Imperial emblem is always visible on their uniform.Members of The Office of Investigation and The Office of Surveillance are given fairly broad personal allowance with how they dress. So long as they look professional, have the majority of their skin covered, and dress in shades of black, grey, or crimson, their uniforms are fit for service.The Office of InvestigationAs the name implies, this office conducts formal inquiries into criminal matters relating to criminal and civil law. The office itself is host to a few different ranks of officers, but the most notable, and infamous, are The Investigators themselves.These persons are given broad powers to collect evidence, testimony, and even personally interrogate suspects. In addition, Investigators work closely with The Courts regarding the prosecution of crimes. Evidence and accounts from the Investigators heavily influence the final verdicts in cases.Within The Courts, advocates are assigned to follow the cases of several Investigators, helping to collate evidence and keep records, as well as assist with transitioning an investigation over to a trial, if necessary.The Office of SurveillanceNo one really knows the true location of this office. The Empress\u2019 Eye in the Citadel may be one of the more visible presences of The Office of Surveillance, but all evidence suggests this is a front for their true operation. Tasked with monitoring every potential threat within Isra, this office has the well-earned reputation of being the most sinister aspect of Isran law enforcement. Surveillance supposedly employs the most mages out of the other offices combined, but their employee records have never been made public.Surveillance often works closely with the Office of Investigation, although it is impossible to tell who is giving orders to who.The Office of Prisons and JailsBased in The Square, an imposing structure built as a hybrid medium security prison and officer headquarters, Prisons and Jails deals with the administrative, logistical, and practical concerns involving housing suspected and convicted criminals in Isra.The central area of The Square holds office space for desk workers, clerks, and investigators from the Office of Investigation currently working on a case involving a prisoner held in the lower levels of The Square. The Mazorana Maximum Security Prison, the Citadel dungeons, The Cube, and The Square\u2019s medium security lockup are all under the jurisdiction of Prisons and Jails.The Office of Gatekeeping and ControlThe well defined and protected borders of Isra are watched over by members of Gatekeeping and entry points into the empire. A detachment of guards lives near each point, performing checks, issuing identification passes, and otherwise protecting the Isran borders.Their public presence means that Gatekeeping works the most out of the other offices on its public image. To the average Isran citizen, Gatekeepers are visible symbols of safety and peace within the Empire.The Office of Gatekeeping and Control has a tight partnership with the Isran Army\u2019s Imperial Flying Corps, formerly known as the Dawn Riders, who provide aerial patrols of the border.
