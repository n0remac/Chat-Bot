{"post-41558": {"user": "The Isran Empire", "user_num": 1310, "timestamp": "1466118139000", "message": "Borders:Single, unaccompanied characters not intending to cause trouble may pass through Isra's borders and gates without stopping or waiting for a response.\u00a0The above does not apply to borders or gates that are said to be guarded against all individuals, regardless of identity, such as The Citadel Gate.All other characters must stop at all threads marked as border threads. This includes groups of multiple characters, NPCs, armies, warbands, single characters that do intend to cause harm, assassins, chickens, and ducks. All chickens and ducks\u00a0must stop at the border and receive a response from The Isranian Guard before continuing. This is non-negotiable. However, if one would like a response even when it is not required, any character is welcome to stop at any border. The Isranian Guard will respond.\u00a0Existing Characters in Isra:If any new characters would like to involve Isra in their history or be living in the city at the beginning of their stories, they must first receive permission to do so. Permission to do this is given rather freely, it is only required primarily to prevent abuse and keep track of just who's living in the city. It's also nice to make sure that someone doesn't create a 30-year-old character who has lived their entire life in Isra, a less than 10-year-old city. Check before making any character that lives in Isra. Message\u00a0Empress Naoki  to check.\u00a0Settings in Isra:Isran citizens may create settings in Isra, but only reasonable ones. Homes, shops, businesses and similar things are all fine. Settings such as personal castles, hives of undead, or settings older than Isra itself are not acceptable. Message Empress Naoki Empress Naoki Empress Naoki to check. In regards to character activity and being in Isra, characters that are Isran citizens may remain in Isra for as long as they like without posting. Characters that are not citizens are assumed to leave the city and go about their business elsewhere after one month of not posting.If you have a question about what is or is not OK to do, send a message to Empress Naoki Empress Naoki. The response will be swift and alleviate any confusion.
