As a species native to the Norkari Mountains, griffins are well suited to the locale, heavily feathered to keep warm, powerful claws with which to grip rocks, and unmatched capabilities of flight for their size. For generations, the griffin has been a component of Norkari culture; the strongest Norkari leaders tame wild griffins and utilize them as mounts. Noticing this, Isra decided that it would do the same, and field griffin cavalry. As such, Isra began the domestication of griffins, and the griffin eyries were built. It didn\u2019t take very long for Isra\u2019s military to be able to field a tenth legion, \u201cThe Dawn Riders.\u201d They are so named because their daily training begins with the dawn.Since that point, many things have changed. Isra\u2019s Military has since been disbanded and reformed into the joint forces of The Free States, and the scope and budget of The Dawn Riders have both increased tenfold. Mounted riders serve a unique role and have proven themselves to be a dominant force in battle, for many reasons. Just to begin with, if one considers an armored griffin as their opponent, that\u2019s a highly formidable opponent, simply because it\u2019s an armored griffin. If one then takes into account that the griffin has a rider, the rider has a lance, the two have been training together extensively, and the griffins, as they\u2019re flying into battle, fly in companies of one hundred, that\u2019s a terribly significant threat. Beyond simply their strength in combat, one must also consider the utility offered by The Dawn Riders. The flight speed of a rider-laden griffin is still considerably faster than most other forms of transport, and the eyes of a griffin are quite keen. These factors make for excellent spotting, and Dawn Riders are utilized extensively in patrolling and defending the many borders of The Free States.The Dawn Riders operate primarily out of the Dawn Rider Barracks in The Citadel and have smaller outposts in the other Free States and distant locations as needed.

The current High Commodore is Elizabeth Finch   .StructureThe Dawn Riders follow the standard Isran military organization, such so that each company of riders is similar in structure to a cohort of legionnaires, albeit with different designations.A Light Company is comprised of lightly armored Riders that are used to scout ahead of the main force as well as provide missile superiority. They are lightly armored and armed mainly with longbows and spears. Medium Companies are the standard Dawn Rider configuration, being armed similarly to Lancers, they wear breastplates and shields as well as wielding lances, sabers, and a small number of javelins. The Heavy Companies comprise the largest Riders and griffins in the Dawn Riders. They wear full plate, or chainmail armor, heavy metal shields, and their griffins are similarly armored. They wield heavy hammers and are the shock troops of the Dawn Riders. Naval companies are armed and armored similarly to the Medium Companies but have been trained to enable them to operate from specially built warships designed to take Dawn Riders across the seas.[Find information about The Free States' military expenditures here.]", "link_list": ["/user/1337", "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VwpA16yuY3QY9QE3Bf3cK9i9GT3CP8WiP245sYXPiyE/edit?usp=sharing"], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/yDKfMV2.jpg"], "html": "<br><font size=\"5\"><u><div align=\"center\">The Dawn Riders</div></u></font><br/><br/><div align=\"center\"><img alt=\"http://i.imgur.com/yDKfMV2.jpg\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/yDKfMV2.jpg\" style=\"max-width:75%;\"/></div><br/><br/><hr><br/><font size=\"5\"><div align=\"center\"><u>Background</u></div></font><br/>Perhaps the most tangible result of the peace brokered between the Isranian and Norkari peoples are the griffins.
