Tying to pin a number on population is difficult, but comparisons of size and importance are most often made to historic Rome. There is no definitive architecture or culture of Isra, as the city is less than 20 years old, and nearly everyone who lives there has moved there from somewhere else. In fact, Isra is in large part a city of refugees, having been founded by survivors of The Cataclysm and having since taken on displaced population and characters from several fallen nations.Isra is a walled city, with gates in the North, South, East, and West. Everyone who enters the city must do so through one of these gates. To enter Isra, make a post entering one of the gates. From the East, South, and West gates, wide boulevards lead directly into the city center and come together at The Central Plaza.Directly north of the Plaza, The Citadel sits proudly as the largest structure in the city. The Citadel is the center of Isran government, where all important officials can be found. It towers above all other structures and regularly casts large parts of the city into shadow.Behind The Citadel, in the northern part of the city, is The Dawnfire Forge and its associated industrial complex. The Dawnfire Forge uses a huge crystal to absorb the light of the sun and cast it into metal. The resulting Sunmetal is produced at this forge alone and has many desirable properties as a metal. As such, it is a hotly traded commodity.In the southern part of the city is The Oculus Solis Arena, the second largest building in the city. It is a colossal coliseum, with seating capacity for thousands. In addition to the significant events, like tournaments and exhibition matches, it periodically hosts small competitions and performances and provides a good location for sparring. Additionally, there is one major landmark outside of the city: The Black Tower. At one point, The Black Tower was also an international peacekeeping organization but has since faded into obscurity. The eponymous tower remains, however. It is significant in that it\u2019s highly visible throughout The Free Plains, and can be used to describe relative location. Perhaps more importantly, however, is what sits atop it: a weapon termed \u201cThe Kami.\u201d Not much is known about it\u2014few even know its purpose. It has only been used on two occasions, both to devestating effect.", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/board/94/isra-free-city", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1605/northern-gate-post-first", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1602/southern-gate-post-first", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1603/eastern-gate-post-first", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1604/western-gate-fortifications-post-first", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1617/central-plaza", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/board/96/citadel", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/board/96/citadel", "", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/board/272/oculus-solis-arena", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1008/black-tower", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1008/black-tower"], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/IMooD22.jpg", "http://i.imgur.com/mwXK52c.jpg", "http://i.imgur.com/uNxgTvb.jpg"], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><font size=\"5\"><u>The Isran Empire - The Free City</u></font></div>"}, "post-84682": {"user": "The Isran Empire", "user_num": 1310, "timestamp": "1535340188000", "message": "The Isran Empire - Notable PersonsThe following characters are, to varying degrees, significant in Isra. Most are household names, and all are present in the realm of public knowledge. Click on each name to view their profile.Empress NaokiEmpress Naoki is the ruler of Isra, and has been since her election several years ago. Under her rule, Isra has grown from the humble citystate it was to the great power it is today. Her name and image are known the world over, by word of mouth and because her face is on the widely-circulated Isran gold coin.Under her leadership, Isra has grown larger and stronger at an incredible rate and she has gone to great lengths to take care of the Isran people. By her doing, food is given to those who have none and many public services have been established. She has so far avoided major scandal, and has given her people little to complain about. However, her detractors call attention to her shameless promiscuity, and that such behavior is improper for one of her standing. However, she is The Empress, and she does as she pleases. Those who have met her in a personal setting report that she is thoughtful, well-spoken, and highly generous.Jun of The CeladineEvery society has its heroes, and of Isra\u2019s, Jun is perhaps foremost among them. Hailing from the Celandine Clan of The Land Tillers, she is a seasoned adventurer, and had already performed a great many feats and saved hundred of lives before beginning to associate with Empress Naoki, the two of which are now reportedly close friends. She is known primarily for her incredible command of magics, especially those elemental, light, and holy. Jun\u2019s magic was instrumental in the seizure of New Brimiarde during the Goraian war, and she has defeated many beasts that were so foolish as to threaten the Isran people. Jun carries the badge and scarf of a Sun Marshal, but thankfully is not called upon often.Ildesias Xen Torsal@illdesias is remembered as the founder and first Lord of The Free City. He was well liked by his people and is generally regarded to have done well in his position. It was under his direction that the monumental feat of engineering that is The Citadel was constructed, and it was he who laid the foundation upon which Isra as we know it has been built.However, Lord Ildesias has not been seen in years; he left Isra soon after his resignation, and is presumed to be living alone, probably somewhere quiet. The profile of Lord Ildesias appears on every Isran copper coin.GrandmaIn comparison to others on this list, very little is known about the entity known as \u201cGrandma.\u201d  She has referred to Empress Naoki as her \u201cniece,\u201d but there is reportedly no familial connection. Nonetheless, Grandma plays a critical role in the administration of Isra and Naoki\u2019s power. Years ago, before even Naoki\u2019s election, Grandma was appointed as Minister of Security by Lord Ildesias. Before, during, and after, Naoki\u2019s rise to power, Grandma has been seen alongside her, and for a time, Grandma carried the badge and scarf of a \u201cSpecial\u201d Sun Marshal. As Imperial Vizier, Grandma\u2019s current role in The Isran Government is ambiguous, though it is known that she leads The Imperial Inquisition\u2014an organization about which even less is known. In the past, she has played a diplomatic role, in that she has visited foreign nations as a representative of Isra. Today, Grandma is seen infrequently, most often in the company of The Empress during crises and important events.Robert FletcherRobert Fletcher, of the highly-prevalent Fletcher family, sticks out among Isra\u2019s wealthy as an influential member of The Imperial Government. Through his familial connections and strategic gifts of chocolate, he has garnered favor with Empress Naoki, and has more influence than his position as Minister of Industry would imply.", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/user/607", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/user/108", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/user/193", "https://i.imgur.com/iiyfGN7.gif", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/user/602", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/user/509"], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/DC4g71U.png", "https://i.imgur.com/m1VpaJp.png", "https://i.imgur.com/cSko4mq.png", "https://i.imgur.com/5q3kbyn.png", "https://i.imgur.com/VdZQzEK.png"], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><font size=\"5\"><u>The Isran Empire - Notable Persons</u></font></div>"}, "post-84687": {"user": "The Isran Empire", "user_num": 1310, "timestamp": "1535355732000", "message": "The Isran Empire - HistoryThe Free City was founded by a group of survivors who found themselves without somewhere suitable to live in the wake of The Cataclysm. So they built their own city, with democracy, and personal freedoms. They chose Ildesias Xen Torsal , an Elven noble, a survivor of The Cataclysm, to be their Lord, the first Lord of The Free City. He would be the head of The Assembly, a collection of 100 persons chosen and elected to represent the people of the city. (June 2015)Under the rule of Lord Ildesias and The Assembly, the fledgling city did well and attracted a highly diverse population. It quickly became a hub for adventurers, mercenaries, and all those who had no greater allegiance. Following a vote, it was decided the city would be called \u201cIsra.\u201d (November 2015)At that point, The Phoenix Imperium was a major military power and had its expansionistic eyes set on The Norkari Mountains immediately north of The Free Plains. If they were to be allowed to seize them, not only would it be less than ideal for the people of the mountains, but it would put Isra in a very bad strategic position. As such, Lord Ildesias brokered a deal with Lord Enlidil of The Norkari, making The Norkari Mountains Isra\u2019s first client state, but leaving the still highly xenophobic Norkari people to their handle their own affairs, as they have ever since. (December 2015)Some months later, a local business owner, one \"Madame Naoki,\" was appointed Minister of Finance and given a seat in The Assembly. Though even before that point, Naoki had a great deal of sway in the city as the head of The Midnight Sun Family, the organization behind The Midnight Sun establishment. (January 2016)Lord Ildesias resigned citing exhaustion, and following a close election, Madame Naoki beat out then-Chancellor Tyrus Spehierian and became Lady Naoki of Isra. After taking power, Lady Naoki installed many of her \u201cfamily\u201d from The Midnight Sun in government positions, establishing a solid base for her power. (April 2016) Ryden Greyiron arrived in Isra as many others had, a refugee of lands now lost. He came to The Citadel following a proclamation by Lady Naoki stating that was searching for officers for her new government. After proving his competency, he was granted the post of Judiciary Minister, in charge of The Citadel\u2019s security and keeping peace in the city. (May 2016)Lady Naoki was approached by one Lord Crovan, the leader of a small settlement to the northeast. He and his family had ruled the area for some time, but lacked workers for their silver mine, and requested that The Winterlands become a part of Isra. Lady Naoki accepted, and The Winterlands became the second state of Isra. (June 2016)Shortly thereafter, now with two client states, Lady Naoki declared the formation of a federal government, The Free States of Isra. She also took on the title of High Lady and used the opportunity to consolidate her power, reorganize, and strengthen the Isran military. (June 2016)Lady Naoki held a political summit in Isra following the destruction of the nearby nation of Aaedan to a terrible apocalypse of dark magic. It resulted in The International Accord of Rights and Protections, which was signed by High Lady Naoki, Warlord Shintaro Nishida of Aozora, Elder Havador (on behalf of the Land Tiller People), King Averin Ararch of Alban, and King Renaux of Trav\u00e9re (Gauldin). The document, which is still technically in effect, grants a number of basic rights to all beings, outlaws slavery, and declares rules regarding prisoners of war. Today, The Accord is largely irrelevant, and the summit did not, as Lady Naoki hoped, result in an alliance of nations to address the atrocities being committed in Goraia. (August 2016) After speaking with Lamina Manira  , an escapee of Goraian prison, Lady Naoki became outraged. Tension had been building between Isra and Goraia since the coup that ousted the ruling Hylon family of Medan, an ally of Isra\u2014which was before Lady Naoki was even elected (February 2016). Lord Ildesias had a policy of neutrality and did nothing when the first harrowing tales reached Isra. Earlier in her rule, Isra was not prepared to make war, but at that point, hearing of what crimes Lamina had endured, High Lady Naoki declared war on Goraia. (October 2016)Isra\u2019s first move in the war against Goraia was to seize Sakand, a distant desert city that Goraia had invaded and occupied shortly after establishing itself. Grandma approached the leadership of Sakand with a simple offer: join The Free States and cooperate in ousting the Goraian regime, and enjoy the associated benefits. Sakand accepted, and with hardly a navy to speak of, Goraia was in no position to contest. (November 2016)Isra then launched a two-pronged offensive into Medan. One was led by Marshal Emahara Untrid through the mountains separating Medan from The Free plains, aimed toward the heartland of Medan. They took losses when the Goraians collapsed a vital tunnel, but pushed through with help from The Dawn Riders, and eventually made their way all the way to the capital, Stonevale. The second attack was a naval assault on the port city of New Brimiarde, led by High Lady Naoki herself from her flagship, The Depravity. Infantry and siege equipment was landed a short way down the coast and marched up to New Brimiarde alongside The Depravity, a sizeable portion of the Isran Navy, and a considerable complement of Dawn Riders supported by their carrier ships. From The Depravity, Enclave Magi Eloria Tyrins   and Jun of the Celadine   performed extraordinary feats of magic to simultaneously siege the city and prevent Goraian magi from retaliating. After taking heavy losses on the wall, the Goraian cavalry was sent out in a last-ditch effort that ultimately proved futile. Within 48 hours, New Brimiarde was under Isran occupation, without a Goraian official to be found.In fact, no Goraian leaders were found whatsoever. The \u201cwar\u201d was hardly a war at all, as it was later learned the Goraian administration abandoned ship. Where they went, no one knows, but Isra was able to liberate Medan swiftly, almost without resistance. (Febuary 2017)Lady Camilla, the bride with children of the late Prince Evrand Hylon, was appointed Duchess of the newly formed Duchy of Meridian. With help from a set of administrators appointed by Lady Naoki, Duchess Camilla rules Meridian, working to regain the glory lost to the Gorian regime. Following Medan\u2019s rules of hereditary transfer of power, her children would be in line for the throne, but that matter has yet to be determined.At this point, Isra had grown from its humble city-state beginnings to The Overworld\u2019s dominant power, left without rival. Following some negotiation, The Land Tiller\u2019s State, Isra\u2019s neighbor to the east, agreed to join The Free States, in need of protection. The following day, High Lady Naoki quietly assumed the title of Empress, and The Free States of Isra became The Isran Empire that is known today.

The first of Isra\u2019s vassal states was The Norkari, the people of the Norkari Mountains immediately north of The Free Plains. A xenophobic collection of beastmen, they joined Isra out of necessity, brokering a deal with Lord Ildesias to avoid being conquered by The Pheonix Imperium. (Mostly archived, some threads remain in the Empire Board.)You can find more information about The Norkari here.The second of Isra\u2019s vassal states is The Winterlands, which are led by Lord Crovan of House Winter   . They are a small kingdom located in the forests and low mountains north-east of The Free City. Under the wing of Isra, they have grown from a humble settlement of 100 to a faction of considerable strength. (Exists in the Empire Board)You can find more information about The Winterlands here, and in Isra's Government Board.The third of Isra\u2019s states was Sakand, an exotic, enchanted city situated on the coast of The Sorala Desert, many miles to the south. It was liberated by Isra in the opening moves of its war against Goraia, who were occupying it. Sakand\u2019s leadership agreed to the generous offer to join what was then The Free States of Isra, and was for a while a valuable trading partner to its northern fellows. However, Sakand has since been granted independence and no longer associates with the known world. (Archived)The fourth of Isra\u2019s states occupies the land south of The Free Plain, the same land that was originally Medan, before the coup that led to the Goraian regime. After Isra liberated it and dismantled the Goraian regime, it was named The Duchy of Meridian, by Countess Camilla Blake    . (Mostly archived, some threads remain in the Empire Board.)The fifth of Isra\u2019s states is The Land Tiller\u2019s State, which occupies the land east of The Free Plain known as \u201cThe Expanse\u201d. They are a collection of several scattered clans, governed by a council of Elders. The Tiller people have a strong connection to the earth, and what can only be described as a mastery of agriculture, along with powerful druidic and elemental magics. Almost since The Free City\u2019s founding, Israns and Tillers were allies. In May 2018, The Land Tillers joined The Free States of Isra, finding themselves in need of the protection and stability provided by Isra. Today, much of The Free City\u2019s food is imported from The Expanse.You can find more information about The Land Tiller's State here, and in their government board.The sixth of Isra\u2019s states is The Grand Duchy of Vortua, a traditional low fantasy setting situated adjacent to the Eastern Forest. Following a protracted and bitter civil war of succession, the remaining nobles opted to offer the crown to Empress Naoki, knowing that she would rule fairly, and the bloodshed would stop. They were proven correct on both counts, as The Empress installed an Imperial Governor to administrate the region and deployed a contingent of The Imperial Army to maintain order.
