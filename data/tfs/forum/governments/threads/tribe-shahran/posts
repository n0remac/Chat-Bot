They believed that the Cataclysm was a punishment inflicted upon the Sakandi people, who had tampered with the natural order of things. The slow decline of the city following the cataclysm led to the creation of more and more tribes, and the desert quickly became known as a place where the people where the only thing more hostile to life than the environment were the warring tribes that clashed alongside the ever-shifting sands.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 When the Goraians\u00a0came, the Tribe was at the forefront of the fight against them, resisting every incursion by the Goraian\u00a0soldiers into their lands, subsequently protecting the ancient ruins and secrets that had long lay dormant in the desert. Throughout their reign, the Shahranians fought them wherever they were weak, seeing them as nothing more than a new face on their old enemy's city. The collapse of the Goraian\u00a0regime and the subsequent takeover by the Israns\u00a0mattered little to the Tribe, for multiple generations they had fought whoever possessed the City of Sakand, regardless of who it was, though few amongst the Tribe remember why they still fight.\u00a0The Shahranian\u00a0Military\u00a0 \u00a0 The military of the Tribe of Shahran is divided into multiple castes, based upon the animals that are tough enough to survive in this harsh environment.

They form the bulk of the force, and are the main force sent to deal with large incursions. They travel through the desert on camelback, dismounting before heading into battle. Their armor and weaponry is light, but finely crafted. The light gear enables them to move quickly through the desert without wasting energy or becoming too tired/dehydrated.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The next group is the Sand Cats. Lightest and swiftest of the Tribe's forces, they roam the Tribe's lands in groups of one to three, constantly scouting for any threats to the Tribe or the appearance of any signs.

They also form the border guard for the Tribe, alerted to the presence of any trespassers by the Sand Cats.\u00a0 \u00a0 The Crocodiles are the Heavy Infantry of the Tribe. They are the largest and toughest of the Shahranian Warriors, able to move through the desert in heavy armor and wield heavy weapons near tirelessly against the Tribe's foes. Often accompanied by Tribal Shamans, they are the second most-elite group in the Tribe, surpassed only by the Devils.\u00a0 \u00a0 The Devils are the personal guard of the Sheikh, comprised of warriors whose courage and devotion to the Tribe has been demonstrated again and again. To be appointed a Devil is the highest honor that can be bestowed upon a warrior, and oftentimes they are sent in the stead of the Sheikh, representing his interests on and off the battlefield. They too ride swift horses as the Jackals do, but are just as capable of fighting on foot, their gear a representation of their original caste.\u00a0(To be continued with Tribal customs, opinions on magic, etc.)", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://imgur.com/UocSnQ5.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><font size=\"6\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Tribe of Shahran</font><br><div style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:x-large;text-align:center;\"><br/></div><font size=\"5\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://imgur.com/UocSnQ5.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/></font><br/><div style=\"text-align:left;\"><br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 The Tribe of Shahran is among the oldest of the various Bedouin tribes, being formed around the time of the start of the Cataclysm, the tribal founders having grown tired of the ways of the City, seeking a more harmonious and natural lifestyle in the Sorala\u00a0Desert.
