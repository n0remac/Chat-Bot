It spreads across the land and is a host to various clans and creatures. The forest is ancient, history of it recorded centuries before the great cataclysm, speculations say that it has been around for at least a millennium or more depending on who is telling the story.There are several areas both within the Usque, and below the Usque, that suggest ancient civilizations that once resided. For example, there are ruins of different villages dotted throughout the expanse of the forest, and there are ruins of dwarven cities in the expansive caverns below.A river winds throughout the forest, fed by springs and a source of manna in some areas. The waters are host to various fish and freshwater creatures, and feed various ponds and lakes throughout the forest.Mountain ranges can be found in different areas, some hosting entry points to the caverns below. One of the mountains (Mt. Piorre) in a particular range is so tall that it would be a feat to climb it and make it back down alive.The western border is near where Medan used to be, and the eastern border is somewhere within the midlands. The northern border is ambiguous as there seems to be a fog. The southern border ends at the middle southern range.The hub of communication, The Drinking Horn, is somewhere close to the western border where there is more modern civilization. This is also close to where Trogdor, the dragon, burned down at least 50 acres of forest.Government\u00a0The people are self governed for the most part, but the goal is to have a central government for situations that require it, and a city or area in which the people travel in order to vote or make complaints.Guardians of the Usque\u00a0A group of women who take the helm of trying to protect the Usque as is tradition. This does not exclude males from doing the same in their own capacity, but the guardians are an exclusive group specifically for women chosen from different villages and tribes.The Way of LifeFor many of the tribes and villages throughout the Usque, people live in rustic dwellings and even hollowed out trees where they can. However, there are also various ruins that suggest higher technology, and even some hidden cities where the dwellings are more refined. The further west you go, the more refined the dwellings might get because of the proximity to outside civilization.\u00a0Some \u201cMythological creatures\u201d that live among normal creatures\u00a0Openly Hostile: Orcs, trolls, gnolls, ogres, rock worms (underbelly), dire wolves, witches, harpies, imps (more to be listed)Neutral: Faeries, nymphs of various types (Dryad included), fauns, dwarves, elves (high and wood), halflings, pixies, tree entities (more to be listed)Peaceful: Unicorns (more to be listed)Characters Involved:FaisineVariaTana the Tongue-TiedFiannaOgiYewbellowYutinSir Cairex ForgepyreBarthlomew EadsD\u00fcen MossbeardMadam HielasRaeran DaezuminSoliePalacePalace of Usque ar HaraConvergenceThe Drinking Horn Tavern and InnTribeVillage of DeilanTo join, just speak to me (Kimmeh) on Discord or respond to this thread!", "link_list": ["https://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/threads/recent/3674", "https://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/post/93167/thread", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/3675/village-deilan-usque-ar-hara"], "image_list": ["https://i.ibb.co/smBw3pz/usque.png"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/smBw3pz/usque.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/><br/></div>"}}
