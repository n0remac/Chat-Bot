At a glance, it is harsh and unforgiving: Savage blizzards and barren highlands steer most travelers away.And yet, life stirs in the heart of the mountains.Strewn across the frigid steppes are countless nomadic tribes, all fighting in a war for territory and power. They are as abundant as they are diverse, ranging from bellicose giants to stalwart valley-dwellers, either hoarding or pillaging for precious commodities. Ore, medicinal herbs, spices, textiles, and grazing lands are but a few things that can be found in the fertile lands that lie just beyond the snowy peaks.Carved into the palm of the highest peak is the nomad capital, Giant\u2019s Hand. It is here that the tribes converge to trade commodities and information. There exists an oath that discourages tribes from shedding blood within the city, lest they face the wrath of the city\u2019s militia. It is a force to be reckoned with, combining the strength of the nomad warriors to create a herculean defense.Nomads and precious herbs are not the only life that can be encountered in Toragana. A wide variety of beasts call the mountains their home, ranging from vicious sabertooths to plush rabbits. Ogres and other such monsters are also residents of the snowy steppes.This is a country of great wealth and great strife; of frigid mountains and rich fields; a place where one will either rise to glory\u2026 or fall to despair.Welcome to Toragana.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"font-size:xx-large;\"><font face=\"times new roman\">Toragana</font></span></div>"}, "post-84971": {"user": "Giant's Hand", "user_num": 3134, "timestamp": "1536549841000", "message": "Map", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/VExiZs6.png"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><font size=\"5\">Map</font><br><br/></br></div>"}, "post-85203": {"user": "Giant's Hand", "user_num": 3134, "timestamp": "1537207930000", "message": "TribesThe TengThe Teng are isolationists, jealously guarding the natural resources located within the Teng Valley. Their capital city, Mabet, prohibits access into the vale, and no army has ever breached their walls thanks to their small but formidable army. They are expert artisans and produce high-quality goods, which is traded throughout Toragana on rare occasions.The TamorjinFierce opportunists who live and breathe for war and glory. They set their sights on ruling the vast plains of Toragana, taking everything and giving nothing back. They welcome outsiders... so long as they shall bow their head to the khan!Hetamante Vil'ni LyudyThe Hetamanate of the Free Men is another of the multitude of tribes that hails from Toragana. The men and women of the Hetamanate live in the far northern steppes, hunting the animals that live in the mountains. They act as guides, and as a mercenary force.The Pack of the Silver DuskAn ancient order of therianthropes who once numbered in the hundreds but now has but a bare handful of surviving pack members.
