{"post-75809": {"user": "Lady Genevieve St. James", "user_num": 875, "timestamp": "1511909261000", "message": "Generic Table of Currency for the OverworldBelow is the standard rate of conversion for currency as well as a suggested price list used throughout the \u2018known\u2019 locations in the Overworld. Standard currency is known as a copper, silver, or gold coin.Should you use this table, you are encouraged to keep to the standard rate of conversion, as well as the three-metal-currency system. However, your character\u2019s kingdom, province, etc. can call their currency by a different name with \u201ccopper\u201d, \u201csilver\u201d or \u201cgold\u201d as an identifier before the name so other players who read your post will understand the economics taking place. For example, your character\u2019s home country might call a gold coin a \u201cgold floren\u201d or a silver coin a \u201csilver stag\u201d.The price list is intended to be a flexible guideline  -- you will not find a complete inventory of every item known to exist, nor do the items have to be the price they\u2019re listed.  For example, an inn that is fancier than a \u201cquality\u201d inn but not more-so than a \u201cgrand\u201d one may have a night\u2019s stay at 3 or 4 gold, or it might be  a \u201cquality\u201d inn but the area has a lot of business competition so the price for a night\u2019s stay is 1 gold instead of 2.Jewelry, precious stones, most luxury and enchanted or magical items are not on this list. There is too broad of a scale for those particular things, so it is up to player interpretation to put a price (or reward) on objects of prominent significance. This scale and price chart was based on D&D 3.5 edition, then heavily edited, simplified and re-priced by Marlee with input and approval from Sara and Bucky. Players with questions or concerns should contact Sara or Bucky.Standard Rate of Conversion for the Three-Metal-Currency: CopperSilverGold1 Copper =11/101/1001 Silver =1011/101 Gold =1001/101Suggested Price List Food, Drink, and Lodging\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Common Ale\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mug -
