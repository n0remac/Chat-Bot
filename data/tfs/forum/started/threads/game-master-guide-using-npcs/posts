The regulations regarding the system surrounding this are detailed in this thread.- A group may claim use of up to 100 NPC points per active account.- A city-state may claim up to 1,000 NPC points per first five active accounts, and 500 per active account thereafter.- A government may claim up to 1,000 NPC points per active account.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For these purposes, an active character is defined as one that is at least the rank of \u2018Established\u2019, has posted at least once in the past 30 days, and has consented to being included as a member of that faction. Even if a character is living in the lands of a nation, or being held prisoner, the character must consent to being counted as part of the government for the purposes of NPC slots.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0NPC slots must be allocated by the faction's leader(s) prior to any utilization. This allocation must conform to how many points the faction is allowed, and should be kept updated as the number of active characters in the group changes. This allocation chart must be shared, either publicly on a group or government thread, described in a post prior to the scene in question, or privately with a member of staff who is mediating the conflict (if one does not wish to reveal such information to their \u201cadversary\u201d). Mediators need this information in order to make an accurate judgment in the case of a disagreement.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0NPC points only\u00a0apply to NPCs that are utilized in conflict against other players. Background citizenry and other \u201cextras\u201d count only as \u201cprops\u201d and may not be used in conflict but may be present to enrich the setting.NPC Slots\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A few exceptions may change the NPC numbers of a group. Namely, different strengths and calibers of troops take up a different number of NPC slots. Some (but not all) examples of how NPCs may be allocated are as follows:- Cavalry - 3 NPCs- Small Siege Equipment (portable ballistae, small catapults, etc.) - 5 NPCs- Large Siege Equipment and creatures (trebuchet, elephant, troll, etc.) - 20 NPCs- Mages (very ordinary, low-powered magic using NPCs - 20 NPCs- Great Beasts (small dragon, wyrm, wyvern, etc.) - 300 NPCs\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Humanoid troops may be scaled proportionately with their strength and training, but you may not allocate less than 1 slot, or more than 20 slots, per soldier. (No \u00bd\u00a0slot \"fodder\" or 100 slot \u201csuper soldiers\u201d are allowed.)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Please keep NPCs generic, with powers and magic used sparingly. All NPCs must be susceptible to physical damage. Also, NPCs are to be portrayed realistically as characters. Please don't subtract from the immersion of the story by treating NPCs as cannon fodder or easily or humorously disposable.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://png.clipart.me/graphics/thumbs/679/weapon-collection-medieval-warriors_67973272.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><font size=\"5\"><b>Using Non-Player Characters (NPCs or \"extras\")<br><br/></br></b></font><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://png.clipart.me/graphics/thumbs/679/weapon-collection-medieval-warriors_67973272.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/><br/><br/><br/><div style=\"text-align:left;\"><span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Governments and Groups may utilize non-player characters as part of their armed forces or ranks.
