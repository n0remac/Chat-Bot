They are, in practice, any formal alliance of characters--any cause or organization that brings characters together. Examples of groups are small factions, businesses, mercenary companies, bands of raiders, pirate crews, or any\u00a0organization where characters can interact together and be affiliated without being a government. Any organization that does not govern a nation can be made into a group. Having a group entitles you to some NPCs.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Groups have the privilege of controlling NPCs that can be used for all purposes in the story, including conflict. A group's capacity to use these NPCs is limited by the number of characters within it. The maximum number of NPCs available to a group's leader is 100 per active account. Refer to the NPC rules thread for more clarification on NPC use. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To make a group, create a thread on the Groups board\u00a0titled with the name of your group. It should contain at least these things:- A point of contactA location or account that may be visited or messaged with to interfacewith your group. This could be a character in the group, a town in\u00a0which the group conducts its business, or a specific thread that serves\u00a0as your group\u2019s base. This is where people will go to speak to your\u00a0group, so whatever you choose should be frequently active.- DescriptionInclude a brief description of your group. You don\u2019t\u00a0have to be very specific, however you have the option of being as\u00a0in-depth as you\u2019d like. Just as long as people can read it and get some\u00a0idea of what your group is.- How to join (if possible)If it is possible to join your group,\u00a0outline how to do so. Should characters PM someone? Should they show up\u00a0in-character to a base? Tell people how to get their characters involved.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, do they have a symbol or flag? Do they have relationships with other groups or governments? Use your group thread to paint a picture of your organization, and tell players what they\u2019re about.", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/3207/game-master-guide-using-npcs", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/board/15/groups"], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/95rpG2n.png"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><b><font size=\"5\">Groups and Families</font></b></div>"}}
