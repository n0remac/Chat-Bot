The theme is set in medieval fantasy, and so the use of magic, special powers, and other mythical phenomena may occur in the game. You are free to stretch your imagination with this creative aspect of fantasy. However, there are just a few golden concepts:Mythological CompatibilityAll mythological phenomena, magical effects and spells, and other paranormal activity are considered to be fully compatible with one another. This means no one character's energy source or magic system is invulnerable to the effects of another. This means all paranormal energy sources and magic systems are subject to silence effects and energy barrier defenses.Spells Must be Charged in ConflictIn conflict, all paranormal effects and spells must have at least one turn spent casting the spell or preparing the effect. The number of turns spent casting or calling an effect lends power to the effect.Silence Effects and Magical BarriersPlayers may sometimes want to use effects such as silence or various shields and barriers. Because all paranormal effects are considered compatible, these effects could potentially work to mute a range of spells and abilities. Silence effects could take the form of enchantments or spells requiring minimal preparation time. Barriers and shields, however, must be charged over time according to their strength.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Passive powers innate to the character, and the physiological benefits innate to a character's species or composition, may still technically exist under silence effects. This includes the undeadness of a zombie, walking skeleton, or vampire, the existence of a ghost, and the existence of silence effects themselves. However, abilities or spells may not project or materialize within the field, which limits the character being affected to the bare essentials of passive effects. (For example: shape-shifters cannot shift, and dragons cannot use breath attacks, but both creatures may exist in the field, despite being considered by most to be magical beings).Limitations\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All mythological effects are scene-dependent; powers are localized to their respective threads. This means the effects of spells, power attacks, and curses from a character are not to proliferate into other threads unless the source character is present. Charging times are also localized. Characters cannot cast a spell in one thread and have it affect another, and all spells or paranormal abilities must be prepared in the thread they are cast.There are three notable exceptions to the limitation of magic across threads.
