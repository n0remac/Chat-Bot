Here are some guidelines for creating quests: 1. Be original and creative with your quests. The more roleplay your idea creates, the better it is. Really think something through before posting it.2. Specify a speed you want it to play out at. If you are around quite often, that is one thing, but if you expect long absences between posting, then it's courteous to let others know that it will be a long-term, slow tempo role play.3. Consider making your quest require multiple people, cross paths with other quests, or otherwise try to increase character interactions as much as possible.4. \"Bump\" your quest thread every week if you wish to keep it open. Do not bump more often than weekly, but do expect that if your quest thread goes stagnant for several weeks or you disappear, your quest might be closed (to prevent clutter and ensure existing quests are active)!5. Do not write a quest if you think you may be unable to respond to and maintain it in the weeks and months ahead. Abandoned quests will be moved to the outdated quests board. It is important that all available quests are active.", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/board/9/quests"], "image_list": ["https://thumb10.shutterstock.com/mosaic_250/4369435/713431987/stock-photo-old-paper-scroll-and-quill-pen-on-wooden-paper-with-copy-space-713431987.jpg"], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><font size=\"5\"><b>Writing Quests and Jobs<br><br/><img alt=\"A picture here\" src=\"https://thumb10.shutterstock.com/mosaic_250/4369435/713431987/stock-photo-old-paper-scroll-and-quill-pen-on-wooden-paper-with-copy-space-713431987.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/></br></b></font></div>"}}
