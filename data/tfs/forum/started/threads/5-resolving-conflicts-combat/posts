These conflicts should play out as logically as possible, with predetermined mediators when necessary, in order to maintain the natural flow of the storyline. If you eventually do find yourself in a irreconcilable disagreement with another character and conflict is inevitable, there are certain rules to playing it out, be it two characters fighting one on one or entire armies battling for control of land and resources.1. Players cannot force the conclusions of their actions on others.Nowhere in the Fantasy Sandbox is a player permitted to force the consequences of any actions upon another's character before they are given an opportunity to respond. However, you are obligated to respond if your character is interacted with. This rule applies to individual characters as well as game assets such as non-player characters.\u00a02. The supporting content of an attack or defense determines its strength.The number of posts spent preparing an attack or defense, or the details used in describing an attack, are both solid examples of supporting content. Simply saying that your character is stronger, or that your character has trained more, does not count as supporting content.3. While you may have an unlimited amount of characters, their losses are permanent.Should a character become victim of a conflict or circumstance in which they cannot feasibly survive, then the character dies. It is encouraged to play more than one character and to know that none of them may be invincible.\u00a0While magic may exist, necromancy (raising the dead) is limited to undead, and may not occur spontaneously. It requires the assistance of a capable character in the same thread as the deceased.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If you have reason to suspect that an in-character conflict may not be resolved in a mutually agreeable fashion between all involved parties, please request the involvement of an impartial mediator. You can post on the Requests of Staff thread and ask a staff member to do it, or ask a non-staff, impartial party to mediate. Alternatively, you may private message Admin . The important things are that both parties in the conflict agree on the mediator chosen or appointed, and agree to abide by their judgment.
