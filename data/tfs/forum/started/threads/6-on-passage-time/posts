It is important to post in turn if a turn-based order is already established, and events that happen occur in the order in which they are posted. Yet beyond individual scenes, where time is mainly consistent, the passage of time is very relative in the Sandbox and impossible to measure. A scene describing several minutes in-game may span months in real life, while several scenes describing the passage of months may be written in that same time. Mending these inconsistencies and determining the in-game time elapsed due to travel between settings are up to the players and their creative interpretations. Yet despite this freedom, there are a couple important phenomena that tend to occur that one should be aware of:Time Freezing\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Occasionally, you may find yourself in a scene that has stalled. A frozen scene due to the absence of a required player can usually be safely abandoned. However, if it is of particular importance that the scene is completed and resolved, you may request a resolution from staff after a certain amount of time has elapsed. The resolution will always have a neutral outcome where possible.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In most scenes, players have two weeks to reply before the scene becomes eligible for a resolution. In scenes with multiple players, the majority must vote to resolve the scene as opposed to waiting for the missing player.In scenes involving direct combat or imminent danger, players have one week to reply before it becomes eligible for a resolution. Again, this resolution will be a neutral outcome where possible, including a complete void of the scene if necessary. Scenes involving multiple players must still vote to have it resolved, but such scenes must be completed before any of the affected characters can begin new scenes.Time Splitting\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While events are considered to happen in the order in which they are written, players may still choose to post in multiple scenes concurrently. There may be times when a scene you're writing in has slowed down or stalled, and you would like to immerse your character in other scenes as well. This is allowable, and the order in which the scenes are taking place during your character's personal history are up to your discretion. However, an exception exists: if your character is put into direct combat or imminent danger, that character may not start any new scenes until the current scene is resolved. This is why it is important that such scenes are resolved at an agreeable pace.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/Tn38ot6.png"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><b style=\"font-size:x-large;\">On the Passage of Time</b></div>"}}
