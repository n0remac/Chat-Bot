If your question isn't shows here, refer to the other threads in the Introduction board, or ask in the active shoutbox at the bottom of every page. Q: Where should I start? / Where is a good place to start?A: The Quests Board is a good place to start. There, you can find organized quests that are generally open for all players to participate in. Or, if you would prefer to engage in more freeform RP, simply showing up to one of the Overworld\u2019s many nations or cities and seeking out other characters can be a great way to start off.

To work around this problem, refresh the page by pressing F5, or press the refresh button in the lower right corner of the chatbox.Q: Am I able to utilize (this technology) or (that technology)? Even in small, isolated quantities?A: Generally, if you're referring to a technology that is outside the scope of medieval-fantasy then the answer is no. (This includes, but is not limited to any technology from the genres of sci-fi, steampunk, or modern day.) We take theme very seriously on TFS because as a medieval-fantasy sandbox, many players come here to escape technological themes for a more \"old times\" vibe that features knights, castles, bows and arrows, swords, dragons, and feudal monarchies. For this reason, it can become immersion-breaking to encounter firearms, steam technology, and scientists in lab coats\u2014 or even some plot devices that clearly resemble these things. This can remain true even in a fantasy world that features equipment from earth eras that also featured widespread gun use (such as the rapier).The important fact to understand in a sandbox setting is that even if introduced in small, isolated pockets, a technology one person can have, is a technology that everybody can have. That means that even if many fantasies considered medieval will occasionally showcase some kind of \"magitech,\" and that a number of them have their own version of \"steampunk dwarves,\" and so on and so forth, playing on the fringes of basic medieval tech is generally frowned upon on TFS.If you have further questions, please ask in the shoutbox below or in our Discord server and one of our staff will be happy to help you.", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/3203/4-magic-paranormal-powers", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/3202/3-on-quests-accepting-jobs", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/3200/1-creating-new-characters-accounts", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/threads/participated", "https://www.google.com/docs/about/", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1359/8-governments", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/3208/game-master-guide-groups-families", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/3209/10-game-master-guide-governments", "https://discord.gg/crSw4R"], "image_list": [], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><b><font size=\"5\">F.A.Q.</font></b></div>"}}
