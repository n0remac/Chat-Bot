Because the number of locations can expand infinitely, it's best to use naming regimens for related threads to help keep the list clean and navigable. Generally speaking, a thread must have a name that plainly describes the location. So a house may simply be called:Admin's House\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes, you may need to split a story setting into multiple locations, depending on the volume and context of interaction that may occur. For these scenarios, such as individual rooms within buildings, try using a dash ( - ). For instance:Admin's House - Living Room\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All nations are required to have at least one border thread, representing the outer peripheries of their nation's land, and any gates, defenses or fortifications around them. These are known as border threads, and may also be used for the gates of castles, cities, or other important locations worth having a gate. These border threads are always stickied to the top of the sub-board they allow entry to. -\u00a0When entering a nation or area guarded by a border thread, a character or group of NPCs must always post first at the border thread, if the border thread requires that they do so.-\u00a0The ability to \"teleport\" or \"scry\" can circumvent the requirement to post at the border thread, provided that A: the caster has knowledge of the location, B: the caster specifies in their post the manner of their arrival, and C: the target thread is not warded. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This should be clearly marked on the topic post of the border thread by the creator of the thread and the controller of the setting. Some borders may allow you to pass freely without speaking to any guards, and this will also be clearly stated on the border thread. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If you are the one to define a location, then you are starting a thread and are the first to post there. As the creator of the location, you are obligated to provide a full visual description in your first post depicting what visitors would immediately perceive. All character interactions are to be done on subsequent posts. The first is reserved for a descriptive text or embedded picture or video that can help other players understand the setting they may be about to write about. This may also be a good place to suggest any kind of ambient music that may be emotionally descriptive of your setting. While a location doesn't require as much activity on the part of its creator as a character does, it is courteous to keep the first post of your location up to date with any changes in the description as the story progresses, in order to keep newcomers posted. It is also best to stay updated with new characters and events that come to your setting and respond accordingly.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Do remember that if you're playing in someone else's thread, you are not in control of the setting. The creator of the thread controls the definition, responses, and everything else about that location unless they say otherwise. You may create as many of your own locations as you'd like, but you are not permitted control over the locations of others.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><b style=\"font-size:x-large;\">Threads &amp; Settings</b></div>"}}
