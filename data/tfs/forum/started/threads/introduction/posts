The game relies solely on emergence for its life and growth, within a liberal safety net of basic rules and guidelines to ensure continuity and flow. Therefore, players are encouraged to get friends into the game, proliferate characters, build plots and ideas, and weave stories among them, all contributing to the development of a wholesome fantasy world.Writers are invited to create characters and experiment without limits to the imagination, as long as the content fits an old-world setting that does not involve the use of firearms or modern technology.GETTING STARTEDThe first thing to do is to create your first character. A character is associated with an account on the forum, and so it is accurate to say that almost all accounts are characters (though may also represent locations and factions). You may have multiple accounts for multiple characters, but it is strongly recommended you only make as many as you can play regularly. Please visit this page for more information on characters and accounts:Creating New Characters and AccountsOnce a character has been created, they can then begin their story in any public setting (click here to see the current game) they choose. You may also create your own settings within the game. Settings are user-defined by individual threads in the Overworld section of the forum. Unless otherwise specified, all threads are considered open for anybody to join.You may only control your own character and plot devices (including NPCs) unless otherwise given permission. Actions can not be forced on other characters, as the affected characters must be given an opportunity to respond.It is generally courteous to post in turn if a turn-based order is already established.\u00a0Aside from this, time is very relative in the Sandbox--the order (if any) of posting between players and times taken for in-game travel between settings are up to players and their creative interpretations.The realm and its geological features are defined entirely by its participants, and its populace may consist of individuals, families, gangs, clans, kingdoms, or empires. While some rules determine the overall power and resources of a group, you may even design your own\u00a0if you feel up to the responsibility of leadership.While this is primarily open-ended play, there are some basic rules to adhere to that help ensure the flow of the game and allow it to proceed as smoothly as possible. It is also important to understand that maturity is an important source of story continuity and fun. The content of your journeys, due to the multiplayer nature of this writing game, may at times be unsuitable for younger audiences. Also, please remember that as a persistent, player-made world, this is not Earth, and while references to Earth are not really a serious cause for breaking the rules, expect them not to make much sense in the context of the game.If this is your first time playing, please be sure to familiarize yourself with the basics posted below, and please come say hello in our community chat and our Discord server!Have fun!\u00a01.
