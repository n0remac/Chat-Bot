When he reached the rear of the young dragon, he cut off its tail.\u00a0\"This would make a fine weapon indeed. Nothings sharper than a dragons claw... or tail.\" Hope said with a little chuckle. \"Perhaps I can take it back to that smith and have her fasten me a good weapon from it.\"Hope continued to search the body for any clues.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "@aepessa  "}, "post-63632": {"user": null, "user_num": null, "timestamp": "1492848129000", "message": "The beast was dead, her body now defiled.
