Since it's beginning, what we've wanted the nation to be and represent has been fleshed out, and we now believe it's time to get the ball rolling and move from less of an experimental phase of RP to more of a full time gig.\u00a0 \u00a0 Katashima is more than just another government group trying to be the dominating power in the Sandbox.\u00a0This group would like to present a cultural experience to a fantasy roleplay primarily featuring themes representing old European cultures. It exists on an island far from Medan's shores, far enough to geographically isolate it, and trade and travel is few and far between, resulting in cultural isolation as well. Simply put, it exists within a set of conditions that are favorable for the mimicry of Japanese culture.\u00a0 \u00a0 We are hoping to present this culture within a medieval-fantasy world, but we also want Katashima to become a fairly mature experience. While Katashima will have much of its own uniqueness, this is a haven for those who may enjoy Japanese culture, including those players inspired by anime, but expect that we will be more focus on parallels with the real-world old Japan rather than the pop-anime presentation of it, particularly when it comes to the rigidity of social structure and an emphasis on realism when it comes to the prized martial arts and the samurai class. Here, magic exists but is rare, and many will be superstitious.\u00a0 \u00a0 We would like to extend an invitation to all the players of the sandbox to join us in creating this experience. If you would like to join us, we can certainly play the \"foreigner-to-strange-lands\" theme, but it is preferable to create an account for a character native to our lands.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hope to find some interest!", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>"}, "post-4607": {"user": null, "user_num": null, "timestamp": "1434820874000", "message": "I got the time to help out and I want to see all aspects of the RP flourish.
