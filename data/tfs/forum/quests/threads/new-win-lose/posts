It has characteristics that are almost otherworldly; magic cannot manipulate it, steel picks cannot break it and it bathes its immediate surroundings in a spectrum of lights and colours from green and blue to purple.\u00a0It is suggested that the ancient dwarves once knew of it, for the smallest stones and samples have been discovered in mountain homes long brought to abandon and ruin by time, but no amount significant was ever discovered except just enough to create trinkets and rings.\u00a0Now kordanite\u00a0is showing up again, here and there and far between. Perhaps smithed into a sword that seems impossible to break, or crushed into a fine powder that's chased meticulously by unusually strong men in a feverish state. No-one seems to know the source of it, or who can accomplish the difficult task of smelting and forging it into something useful when all conventional techniques fail...A kordanite sword.\u00a0Yet there's no mistaking that below the common eyes, the whispers of this new ore seem to be growing as rapidly as the interest in it. Perhaps you know a man who knows another who has a cousin who swears he knows how to get hold of it; that it cannot only be made into armaments, but processed into something that solves all of life's problems! Perhaps you've seen a warrior on the field of battle with a strange blue glow in his eyes and the strength of two men, who fights like a lion and brings victory to his comrades for the small cost of a small pouch of crystal powder that merely has to be placed upon the tongue and swallowed to gain its benefits. Or perhaps you've seen a new breed of beggar in the most decrepit places of society, wandering in feverish states and seeking kordanite more vigorously than satisfying their own basic needs...\u00a0InformationKordanite is an otherworldy crystal ore that, when using the right tools and the hottest smelters, can be forged into weapons and armour that are nearly impossible to break and a sharpness unmatched by all normal weapons. The armour offers increased protection from nearly all things, including magic, but is not impervious to it. Kordanite armaments are also easy to enchant with magical effects, which are then enhanced by the magic naturally present in the material itself. When raw kordanite ore is processed in a specific way, it can be broken down into small crystals and powders that when ingested imbue the user with not only a mind-blowing feeling of euphoria, but also increased strength and perception in both physical and magical areas. The drawback, however, is that if kordanite powder's use is not limited or the user does not have enough willpower and self control, it becomes a highly addictive substance capable of destroying minds and lives.The only current way to gain access to kordanite is through trade with\u00a0The Vellir of Ni\u00f0avel, or those they have already traded with.\u00a0To forge kordanite into armaments, a powerful forge capable of reaching heats far beyond normal forges is needed. Additionally, a high degree of skill and tools that are better than steel are required.To forge kordanite into kordanite powder, a highly skilled mage or alchemist must use whatever methods they can find to safely deconstruct the ore into its base materials, then process it further into powder without losing the naturally imbued magic. This process is highly volatile and could cause dangerous magical explosions if not completed with care.\u00a0Unrefined kordanite also 'spreads'. If placed in stone or other ore, the magic present within will slowly begin to morph and change the surrounding materials into further kordanite.\u00a0OOCKordanite is meant to introduce a material to TFS that can generate dynamic RP for all sorts of characters, whether through direct interaction with this account or not. It is perfect for organisations\u00a0who want to supply their military forces with high-grade, magical weapons but also ideal for criminal syndicates who wish to deal or partake in illegal substances. Additionally it can be exploited by warriors or mages who wish to use ability-enhancing 'drugs' or controlled by anyone as a natural resource that slowly becomes more common in the Overworld, whether to trade for wealth or simply keep for power. Or perhaps an organization simply doesn't like it and plans to try and destroy it wherever it's found!If you're interested in getting hold of kordanite for your groups/factions/characters, feel free to PM me or post here and we can sort something out ICly. To begin with, the only way to get hold of kordanite will be through the Vellir themselves and certain other, undisclosed groups and characters.", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/2898/vellir-ni-avel"], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/oxoOW4b.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/cu1rrvI.png"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><br><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/oxoOW4b.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/><br/><br/></br></div>"}, "post-75181": {"user": "Riley Fletcher and Cheesecake", "user_num": 2479, "timestamp": "1510181660000", "message": "Would you be willing to do an RP with my character negotiating supplies of the ore being sent to the heroes' guild?", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Would you be willing to do an RP with my character negotiating supplies of the ore being sent to the heroes' guild?"}, "post-75234": {"user": "The Realm of Ni\u00f0avel", "user_num": 2626, "timestamp": "1510412731000", "message": "Sure!
