It appears that one Dra\u00edochta has managed to taint the name. When a name is only known to a few in a good way, it is very bad rep to have a bloody axe-murderer screaming the name.Smertas Dra\u00edochta is a dangerous and deluded individual who believes in stopping magic from ruling society and allowing the \"ordinary\" humans to rise up above the mages who would belittle them. He does this not through diplomacy and cool-headed discussion, but by the sword. His mad crusade has left dozens of people dead already, and a stop needs to come to this.As such, his distant cousin, Altameir Dra\u00edochta, wishes to find someone capable of stopping his kinsman before the Dra\u00edochta name is permanently stained in blood. He would prefer to simply dissuade or capture Smertas, though he understands that some people cannot be talked to. You can meet Altameir in Isra, the Free City, at the Saucy Maid \u2013 he has tracked Smertas to this city and would prefer to keep an eye on him.In plain, OOC English:This will be a relatively fast-paced quest; the goal is to persuade Smertas Dra\u00edochta to stop murdering magic-users, or if necessary, capture or kill him. To begin, meet Altameir Gro\u00dfchwert Dra\u00edochta in the\u00a0Saucy Maid Tavern, inquiring after Smertas.I will be active daily, so the quest shouldn't be very slow-paced or long term at all.", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/695/saucy-maid-tavern"], "image_list": [], "html": "Pasted to some walls outside taverns, tacked to a bulletin here or there, and spread by word of mouth, is a tale of cousins, blood, and, well, more blood."}, "post-16015": {"user": "Queen Audrey I von Audria", "user_num": 678, "timestamp": "1447621057000", "message": "Could Smertas be convinced to kill only specific magic users?
