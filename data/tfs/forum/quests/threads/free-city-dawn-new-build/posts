Included aside from the written words, you notice two beautifully illustrated pictures. The first, a landscape painted with primitive colours, features a large open plain nestling into the side of a mountain range. On the far side of this plain sits a river and beyond that, forested hills. The second painting, meanwhile, features a similar landscape - perhaps identical - with the addition of a magnificent, walled city by the river. Ships dock in the harbour and citizens and carriages enter the city through gates of splendour. Archers and other soldiers stand proudly on the walls adorned in shining armour that glistens in the sun.Curious, you find yourself reading the included texts:'Farmers, workmen, hunters, gatherers, soldiers, fathers, mothers, children; a new life awaits you beyond the small towns and rural villages. A life that can be crafted; moulded and formed into something great enough to stand the test of time. To create a kingdom, an empire, for the free-spirited men and women seeking more than simple survival in our turbulent age. The city is a concept almost lost in our time, one that we seek to revive.We have found the perfect piece of land to build this concept anew. With plentiful resources in the nearby mountains, lumber to cut beyond the river and fertile land with which to farm and feed our families, we extend this invitation to all of you brave enough to leave your homes for a greater purpose:Seek us in the described location. Bring with you your tools, your weapons and your winter camps, for we who seek a better life will build in this place the City of the Free.' A hard challenge to be sure, but one that could reap the greatest of rewards. You can immediately guess the dangers faced by those involved in this mighty dream: raiding and bandits, food shortages, dangerous wildlife and resource procurement. But the results? They just might be worth it.You noticed included at the very bottom of the long poster is a map, leading you in the direction of the Free Plain.

A goblin incursion has been dealt with and a large host of resources and supplies have been acquired. As such, the construction of the city will begin very shortly. However, due to recent events in The Free Plain, including the presence of various powerful figures and magic that could threaten at any time to become too much to bear, the leading council have decided that a new push to recruit aid and protection must be set in motion.As such, word has been spread across country and along roads, using letters sent my birds and words spoken by travellers. Any and all men who wish to be free and start anew should make their way post-haste to The Free Plain and join the encampment of settlers. Especially needed are trained soldiers, rangers, mages and engineers to adequately establish a protective force so that work may begin and continue in peace.\u00a0If interested, you may join ICly through The Free Plain thread by interacting with the settlers or OOCly by posting in this thread:\u00a0The Free City - Information and Recruitment!", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/239/free-city-information-recruitment"], "image_list": [], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><u>Quest Update!\u00a0</u></div>"}}
