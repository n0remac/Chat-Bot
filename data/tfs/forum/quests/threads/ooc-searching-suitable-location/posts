Atop this tower is a mana resonator, which helps \"power\" the city by intensifying the magic presence in the immediate area. This tower depends on a powerful magical artifact to be present atop the city. The city is thus dependent on magic as is the population. Practically all use magic in some way.--Magical fairies inhabit the desert. They gravitate towards the magic of the tower and the city, but otherwise will gather in small oasis in small populations.These are a couple lore points you could work with as a starting point in weaving in how/why your dragon exists/existed here for so long. The recent ignition of the Tallak Ka Ara following the acquisition of a powerful magical artifact might have in some way signaled your dragon to return to the land. If so, the threat of dragon retaliation might pose a formidable deterrent to anyone who'd attempt to remove the artifact from Tallak Ka Ara and remove the power source.
