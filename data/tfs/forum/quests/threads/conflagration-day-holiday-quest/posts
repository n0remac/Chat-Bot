A goal that literally any Sancturian has business being involved in. To that end, I propose a parade for the greatest achievement of our glorious empire, the completion of the Grand Cathedral!\u00a0 I would like to involve as many people as possible, so let me know if you'd like in and in what context but I'll be messaging people about stopping by to involve them regardless.I'm planning on making a big ceremony out of the whole thing, so people can march at the head of their forces, and the procedure for the 'quest,' though I'd really call it 'loosely structured interaction.'\u00a0 Would you guys be down for something like this? Of course, I'd still produce problems like a traditional quest runner. I'd just expect slightly less combat.I'm going to bed in a few hours, so I'm gonna have to pick it up tomorrow so I don't have to drop it only 2 or so posts in for a whole day. Currently in the shortest stage, planning, which will be more or less this:Speak with the Arthyr, Meryn and Mr. Chumps to acquire funds.Post the route map so people can plan for where they want to be when they see it. Keep in mind, a point of this march is so people can make a pilgrimage to the Grand Cathedral, so you could follow the whole way, no problem.Speak with heads of armed forces to ensure support and pull troops for the march and try to prod leaders to march at the head.Don't expect much combat, as in, expect none (I think, gonna wing a bit) unless you're a guard or looking for trouble. I'll give combat or make stuff happen on request.This is gonna be very unstructured, so feel free to do whatever.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://imgur.com/KguTVPq", "http://i.imgur.com/KguTVPq.png"], "html": "Hey, people, know what we need?
