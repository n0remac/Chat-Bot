I ask of the nearby guardians to delve into the early layers of the mine, and discover what lurks within the shadows.\"Something stirs the Stone Orcs within the Stone Quarry. A new mystery has sprung up, minors going missing, others seemingly just fractured in their minds. Your objective, dare you accept this message, is to delve into the Stone Quarry and find out what's going on with the miners, and if there's anything else to it. Once done with that, head back to Falkreath to return with news.There have been sightings of nearby miners delving into the forests, but never returning.
