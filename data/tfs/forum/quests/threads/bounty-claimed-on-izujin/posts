The reason why is that a specific transformation potion does not correctly metabolize in Irda, and destabilized his body, essentially causing him to melt. In a rage of vanity, he thrust his magical blade through Koren's chest and looted his entire store.A Bounty therefore has been risen to deal with the (Attempted)murdering thief. Killing him is optional, and mercy is warranted.A reward has been promised for the capture of Izujin, the reward being different for dead or alive.If one were to kill Izujin, the loot they would in fact receive is as followed:A supernatural organic metal blade, which contains nine Etherobes, which allow the blade to devour both spells and the life energy of living beings, as well as reflect spells by parrying them, and creating illusory duplicates of the wielder, as well as copying the magic of others.OrIf one were not to kill Izujin, the loot they would be promised is as follows:A magical rapier that controls wind, and wind related magic, Infused with lightning, water and poison ethrobes, enabling it to create massive poisonous storms, Regular storms, Lightning, rain, typhoons, or toxins on command.In addition, an Etherobe unlike anything ever seen, who's power rivals dragons in all their days.Any adventurer who helps, including the victor, will also get a part of his stock, or whatever is left of it.All that is needed, is the blade Izujin wields as proof for conquering him. He wields the very blade that is offered for killing him.More importantly than that, Koren needs his stock of items that were stolen! If you steal the items, he will not teach you how to use Etherobes, and the items, except potions, will be of no use to you anyway.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "An attack on shopkeeper Koren Quinn, proprietor of The Primal Reaction in the Land Tillers State, was attacked by Izujin, the Irda, inside of his own shop, and nearly killed him.

Koren believes that it is likely that you will face many of the summons previously available for purchase at the shop, and you will find many spells being cast at you at any given time. Lastly, a warning is issued. Izujin wields the vampire sword that Koren himself made. Attacking him head on with spells, would be a folly, and they generally wont work.
