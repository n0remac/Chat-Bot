This gathering will not be one of official capacity and is not designed to reach the public on a business scale.Want to learn the skills required to play your swashbuckling hero character well? Want to develop the ability to navigate a PvPing scenario calmly and confidently? Want to know how to manage yourself and the situation if, God forbid, things get truly exciting and unpredictable in a way that threatens your story plans? Perhaps you just want the intellectual stimulation of a more tactical sort of game without any implications on your current stories. In either case, Lamina Manira is offering a unique and relaxed roleplaying and learning environment where you can learn all of these things, with the fun of being in character.The Dueling School can be found in a lone room in the undercroft of Isra's Oculus Solis Arena.", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/2848/dueling-school?page=1&scrollTo=73401"], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/OOrhLuM.gif"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"></div>"}}
