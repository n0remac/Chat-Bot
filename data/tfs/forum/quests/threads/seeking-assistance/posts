Given that it is personal, he is looking for a volunteer to come with him rather than taking an official escort. The exact nature of the quest will be disclosed to the selected applicant, or applicants, but The High Marshal would like those who volunteer to know that this quest will likely be significantly dangerous. Those interested should report to his personal abode at 13 Riverside Drive.(OoC Warning: This quest will explore some darker themes as Alden's back story is rather dark, perhaps in a cliched way, but still dark.)\u00a0", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1398/13-riverside-dr?page=1&scrollTo=30371"], "image_list": [], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><b>The following notice is being seen around Isra:</b></div>"}, "post-71614": {"user": null, "user_num": null, "timestamp": "1502794220000", "message": "(Aww, sounds like fun.
