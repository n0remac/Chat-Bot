Surely most of them have a story to tell.Well, now's your chance. The next event is essentially a creative writing exercise. The Land-Tiller warriors are in need of inspiration and want to learn more about the outside world. Therefore, all adventures, soldiers, kings, and anyone who has single-handedly fought a dragon is invited to participate. The objective is to share the craziest combat situation your character was involved in.\u00a0The story does NOT have to have happened in-game. You can essentially just make it up, as long as it makes sense in the context of the Overworld.The rules are simple:1. Post at the\u00a0United Training Ground's border thread, stating that you are a traveler from a far-off land seeking to educate the Land-Tillers (or whatever). You don't need to wait for a response.2. Depending on your type of character, post at the following thread:Beast masters go to the Falcon Corps training ground.Archers go to the Mounted Archer Corps training ground.Mages go to the Mounted Mage Corps training ground.Summoners go to the Earth Titan Corps training ground.Scouts and rogues go to the Runner's Trail.Healers go to the Psionic Corps training ground.Melee warriors go to the\u00a0Havburg Knights of the Harvest Chapter House.\u00a0Everyone else goes to the Youngling's Training Camp.3. The recruits will react to your story depending on how good it is. It will secretly be judged by content/creativity, grammar/spelling, and writing quality.On May 1st, the contest will close, and the winner will receive a legendary magic weapon in game. I will also write a poem in honor of this brave warrior.Contest begins...
