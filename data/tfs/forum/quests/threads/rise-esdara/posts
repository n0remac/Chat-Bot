But in order to do this, we will be running a quest to properly introduce the country and reveal it to the world at large. This quest will involve the attack of a giant creature upon the Land-Tiller's Expanse - the hope is that a number of heroes (That's you!) will respond and drive the monster back from whence it came, then kill it, thereby serving as the catalyst that will reveal this nation.As for what Esdara is? Well, you'll just have to wait and see! The Kingdom will be launched a few days after the quest finishes, and all those who participated in the quest itself are invited to be the first people to set foot on Esdaran soil.A few things worth noting:1) I will be DMing the quest/NPCing the monster. I'm around pretty frequently, so I expect this quest to be fairly fast-paced. I ask that you either be around a good deal, or at least keep a close eye on things and make sure to post as promptly as possible.2) This quest will be left open to those wishing to be involved until midnight on Saturday the 16th of July, PST. Anyone interested in participating should respond to this thread prior to that time, whereupon it will be officially closed and archived.3) Once everyone has responded, this quest will be officially launched at some point in the afternoon of Sunday the 17th of July.That being said, happy gaming! I look forward to questing with all of you. :)", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "A new nation will be making its appearance in the Overworld soon - the Kingdom of Esdara.
