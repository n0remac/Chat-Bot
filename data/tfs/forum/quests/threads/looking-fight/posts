I am willing to play as the evil villains in a variety of scenarios to provide fun RP in an epic, fantasy style. Or whatever style you want really (some viewer discretion is necessary).I am offering:- Lairs for a variety of monsters, bandits, etc for the would-be hero to plunder, loot, raise to the ground, whatever his/her little heart desires.- Random ambushes! Traveling along the road with no encounters too boring? Don't want to get stuck being attacked by those dudes controlled by a never posting blue dragon? Look no further!- City attacks! Want to prove the might of your army in battle? Introduce a new setting with aplomb? I am the account for you!- Constant warfare! Need an enemy to justify your Empire's draconian policies? Just ask and I will provide!- Quest related bad guys! Want to tell an epic story of the valiant defense of your city but lack a suitable bad guy! I am your dude!- Anything else that you think would fit in with these ideas! Everything is up for discussion!PM me or reply to this to get a conversation started on these things!\u00a0Note on NPC Points: This account would be rather useless with them, so for the sake of the story will not use them. As such, only the owners of the settings (or those who can provide proof the owner is alright with this) should ask for me to do anything drastic like massive orc armies and the like. The strength of the army will default to \"just enough for evil to win the day, if only it weren't for those pesky heroes pulling off last minute shenanigans or last stands and the like.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "So this is less a thread of quests and more of an offer.
