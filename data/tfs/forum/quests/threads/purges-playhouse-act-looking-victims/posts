People entering The Misty Woods to be teleported randomly, Wizards opening portals to a place they did not want to go, adventurers randomly falling through a rift to a dark abyss. They say that if you go to areas of unstable magic or if you use teleportation magicks, you'll be intercepted by a mysterious force, pulled to alien world. Few have returned from this world, and they speak outlandish tales that may just be stories. Tellings of swarms of monsters flying across a sky both dark and luminous. A land where the whimsical wisps are plenty. Carnivorous trees and twilight drakes from a long dead age. An Ethreal King sitting upon a dragon's throne, one who pays special attention to outsiders in his realm. Sometimes he'll invite you to his world, or he'll find you trespassing, either way he'll offer to play a game with you. Win and you go home, lose and you die.\"I am the one who punishes the Overworlders for their imprudence. Their cataclysms did more than damage their world, the affects echoed into mine causing a far greater distruction than they know. My world was annihilated by the great cataclysm, the bodies of my people torn apart by a slicing maelstrom of magic. All that was left were voices, our disembodied souls could do nothing but wander the void aimlessly until we learned to consume energy to gain new forms as beings of pure energy. I fed off of the strongest creatures, including the Twilight King that once ruled the ruined plane.So come to my realm if you dare, I'll show you the folly of your kind's mistakes.\"_________________________________\u00a0If you have or wish to make a character to come to my world and become a victim of a cruel game you can message below or send me PMs. There are a few ways to enter or be pulled into the Ethereal realm, coming up with how you ended up there will be required knowledge. Once you message me your interest to be part of my next thread I will PM you the URL and will post where you want me to abduct you. From then on you will be trapped in my realm until you die or find a way to escape.-Purge", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "In your travels you may have heard a few rumors.
