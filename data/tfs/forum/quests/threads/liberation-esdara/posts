It was a setting opened and run for a few months during late 2016/early 2017, and reluctantly abandoned when the creators quit TFS due to IRL complications. Well one of the creators has returned and is ready to open Esdara again, but to explain its disappearance and subsequent reappearance, as well as open it up to play again, its augmented recent history has left us some options for a fun quest that I like to call The Liberation of Esdara.For a detailed explanation, you can look at this thread, but the short explanation is this: The island is back, and it's full of bad guys and evil creatures ripe for the slaughter. Your character(s) would be joining with the Esdaran Resistance and returning to the recently reappeared island to cleanse it of the Cult of Xoilun and Xoilun's evil creatures.This IC portion of this quest will begin on the evening of February 15th, which means I'm giving people one week to sign up for it OOCly. ICly, things will happen quickly. An Esdaran PC and a number of NPCs will be arriving on the edge of the Land-Tiller's territory, and dispatching a request across all known lands for brave souls willing to aid in the liberation of Esdara. Characters will have one IC day to hear about the quest and report to the location in question, where they will then be able to choose one of two paths. These are both part of the same quest and will be occurring concurrently.The Eagle's Path will be heavily combative, wherein they will accompany the Zanora Riders (the aerial cavalry of Esdara) up to the island on the backs of their giant eagles. They will go to the city of Zanora'si, where they will drive out the cultists and creatures, and then proceed up to the Fortress of Zanora'si, where they will do the same, and also free the captive zanora from their eyries in the mountains.The Lowland Path will take a different route. These individuals will proceed to the Shaded Valley, up the Sky Portal, and emerge on Esdara via the Door to the Lowlands. From there, they will proceed to the farming hamlet of Cyrili, where they will meet up with the heart of the Esdaran Resistance to rally the loyal Esdarans and do away with what cultists and creatures are there.Once these things have been completed, both groups will converge on the capital city of Esdar'ai, where the heart of the Cult of Xoilun has taken up residence. They will fight cultists and creatures and liberate Esdarans as they proceed to the Palace of the Skies, where they will face the general of Xoilun's army. When this creature is defeated, it will free the High Priest and High Priestess, and Esdara will open up for regular play again -- heavily featuring reconstruction efforts, to start with, all of which your characters will be welcome to participate in.Anyone wishing to participate in this quest should respond below. You have until 11:59 PM Central Standard Time on February 14th to do so. A few notes for anyone who signs up:1) Please be aware that I have a very busy offline life and will, for the most part, only be able to post for a few hours in the evening, my time. I'll post as I can from my phone during the day, but I can't make any promises.2) When responding to this quest ad, please be sure to include which Path your character will be taking.3) Every character who participates will receive a special item at the conclusion of the quest. If you have any requests for what you would like your character to receive, please send a private message to this account, and we'll discuss it one-on-one. Not all requests will be fulfilled as items must mesh with the general premise of Esdara.I hope to see a good turnout!
