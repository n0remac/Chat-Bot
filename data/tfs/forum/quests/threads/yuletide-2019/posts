It is a time of merrymaking, feasting, and gift-giving, characterized by the smells of burning wood, marinated meats, and beer spilled in the snow.As the sun dips past the horizon, The Empress is known to give a speech in the Central Plaza before lighting the eponymous Yule Log. Most of the city comes out to hear her address before retreating into their homes or tavern of choice, to share food with their family or get outrageously drunk, respectively. It is part of the Yuletide tradition to celebrate and make merry \u2014 which is often interpreted as intoxication, so any establishment that sells alcohol earns a great deal of gold during the night of Yuletide. So too do candy shops like Fletcher\u2019s Delectables, because as far as merrymaking is concerned, chocolate is a good substitute for rum. (50% off small chocolate trees!)It is also a Yuletide tradition to share gifts with those that are important to you as a demonstration of appreciation. Even as The Empress is making her speech, merchant stalls and peddlers offer baubles and tchotchkes to the forgetful, and the Bazaar's pre-Yuletide crowd has on a few occasions been lethal.Regardless, it\u2019s a state-sanctioned pretense for debauchery and drunkenness, and everyone in Isra loves it. Travelers flock from all across the surrounding lands to see the spectacle of the great Yule Log and partake in the revelry. Each successive celebration has been greater than the last, and this year\u2019s is shaping up to be the most elaborate yet!Join Isra\u2019s Yuletide celebration starting Sunday, December 1st!Celebration threads will be prefaced with [Yuletide]!", "link_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/gWB6SjR.gifv", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/620/fletchers-delectables"], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/gWB6SjR.gif"], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/gWB6SjR.gifv\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Yuletide 2019\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/gWB6SjR.gif\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/></a></div>"}}
