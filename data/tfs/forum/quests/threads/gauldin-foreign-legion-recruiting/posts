Gauldin is currently recruiting new fighters to prove themselves fighting the barbarians. The barbarian tribes are not united, and they have plagued Gauldin for a long time. Their new and increased activity seems to be aimed both internal to the other tribes as well as to the small villages and farms in Gauldin. The Gauldish\u00a0military does not have the forces necessary to fully deal with this threat. Commandant Murat Lafayette has been ordered by King Renaux to establish and take command of this threat before it becomes any worse. Soldiers will be granted shore leave to explore and familiarize themselves with Gauldin following major engagements. After their period of service is up, soldiers will be granted full citizenship rights in Gauldin, and any who have become officers will be granted small swathes of the newly conquered land.\u00a0Out of character:This will be a fairly persistent combat-oriented quest. Individual tribes will be defeated, as will powerful leaders. New ones will take their place, with new tactics, new tribes, etc. I will also control the barbarians, so any complaints can be brought to me as well. Characters will be granted \"shore leave\" to check out the rest of the country as well. The soldiers in the legion will only be asked to fight against the barbarians (unless they request a transfer), so no worries about having to fight yourself in a war. I will also request that characters even approaching \"god-tier\" not participate, so as to enable the RP to be enjoyable and allow everyone's contribution. Certain characters may at times be asked to step in to assist, but they will not be made part of the Legion permanently.\u00a0Camp thread:\u00a0Gauldin Foreign Legion Camp", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/2148/gauldin-foreign-legion-camp"], "image_list": [], "html": "Recently, barbarian activity has increased along and inside Gauldin's Southern frontiers.
