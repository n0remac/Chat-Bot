If you seek wonder, if you seek glory, if you seek experience like you've never have before, come to Sakand.Your journey awaits you.This missive can be found within Isra, and perhaps one or two of them can be found within Meridian, the Land Tiller's States, and some of the neighboring cities and villages within the Open Lands. There are many tales about the city of Sakand (think Arabian Night's) and only those who have actually been to the city will know if the tales are true or not.Bedouin Wars, Djinni Majic, Flying Carpets, Floating Lights, Brothel Girls like you would not believe\u00a0-- unless you come to Sakand and find out for yourself. There is room for settling and employment, and given its remote destination, adventure is not too far behind. One could make a living there quite easily, if one was so inclined.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><font face=\"georgia\"><i>The Wondrous and Nigh-Mythical city of Sakand is seeking artisans, tradesmen, soldiers, and more!</i></font></div>"}}
