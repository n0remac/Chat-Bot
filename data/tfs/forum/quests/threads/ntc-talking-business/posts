Allow me to explain.Your characters will travel to another land, we'll use Medan as an example.  Go through the necessary transitions/borders to get to their leader.  Just ask him something along the lines of \"will you sign our trade agreement\".  The agreement basically states we require the right to build a Warehouse and a Consensus Office; it also entails that we buy/sell items from their land; finally, we pay the nation a small percentage of our monthly profits.  Oh, and ask what are \"three commodities from Medan\"; that is important.  If the say yes, let me know either on this thread or via PM.  I'll get to work on a thread in their nation called \"NTC Warehouse and Consensus Office - Medan\".  Once that's finished, it is a success.IC-ly, the idea is that we hire merchants in Medan.  These merchants are given the coin to buy specific commodities from Medan (commodity being items/products that aren't found anywhere else), which is stored in the Medan Warehouse.  In comes one of our trade ships, which loads the Medan Goods, and ships them to Asgeir.  In Asgeir, they're unloaded, then stored in the Bleakharbor Warehouse.  The Asgeir merchants then collect the Medan Goods and sell them throughout Asgeir - where they can be sold for higher prices than they would be in Medan.  We make profit.  Likewise, our receptionists log these profits and pay the nation's government a small percentage of that month's income.The Consensus Office is a small attachment on the Warehouse.  Basically, this is where visitors come and ask questions or where new players can be hired.  Ic-ly, the receptionists work here, who log the profits and activity of our operations.\u00a0 More or less, it is the 'Post Here First' for the NTC.Any questions?", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Confused?
