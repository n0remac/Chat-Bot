I am creating a brand new kingdom and want to turn the reforging of it into a big event. Alban is essentially going to be Not-Britain to Gauldin's Not-France. Basic informstion is here:\u00a0The Kingdom of Alban.The Tl;Dr is this: Alban was once a proporous kingdom with four races living in harmony. Then the rightful king was killed and the magic sword that kept the peace was lost. Now the four races are at eachothers throats.The quest will consist of reforging the peace between the four races. In doing so the sword An Dl\u00ed will regain it's power. For this to work certain character need to be made. Specifically the leaders of the four factions. I am looking for volunteers to make these characters:Head of the Wildlings: Filled.Head of the Fae: Filled.Head of the Dwarves: Filled.Head of the Humans: Open.The heads will essentially be DMing a section of the quest. If you are interested in filling any of the two remaining rolls let me know via PM.I am also looking for volunteers to join Avarin's mercenary band as he journeys into Alban. These can be new or existing characters. They can even be natives of Alban, if you'd like to make one. Any and all questions should be posted here. Once we have at least one more person we will be making a request to have the government made.\u00a0", "link_list": ["https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K8RIVDKbbKOQLKPQ5V3Vs0qbWtb5CRsFCLFeTmlNmEY/edit?usp=docslist_api"], "image_list": [], "html": "This is half a quest, half a recruitment drive.
