{"post-45610": {"user": "Empress Naoki", "user_num": 607, "timestamp": "1470067321000", "message": "Hello, everyone. It\u2019s me; your favorite fluffy, cat-eared, (democratically-elected) Supreme Leader, Her Grace the High Lady of Isra, the Grand Duchess Naoki \u200bthe\u200b Smokin' Hot.To jump directly to the point, I\u2019ve decided to try my hand at running a quest. The rest of this post goes into the how and why and a lot of details that aren\u2019t really needed. If that interests you, continue.Things that should be noted:I\u2019ve never, ever done something like this before. Never been a DM, or a GM, or anything remotely similar. This is going to be a new experience for me, and though I intend to give it my best, I\u2019m sure that I\u2019ll make all sorts of mistakes. Fair warning. The characters that participate in this might be harmed. Or maimed. Or mutilated, mauled, scarred for life, or the victim of something far too large jammed where it really doesn\u2019t fit. If you\u2019re not willing to see a character harmed permanently or potentially killed, don\u2019t send them here.I intend, if this goes well, to follow it up with a second bit, similar to and expanding upon this bit. So I would ask that you be prepared to, if you enjoyed this and I actually do end up doing another one, participate in that. The character that I\u2019m posting this with, Naoki here, she\u2019s not going to be involved in it. I\u2019m going to be using my The Starlight Dawn   account. I realize that\u2019s a deal-breaker for some of you, so I thought I\u2019d put it up here, out front.The quest will involve combat, not-combat, a touch of scariness, a moral dilemma or two, and knowing me, probably a fair few lewd jokes. You should be prepared for all of those.Character Restrictions:Essentially none, other than:Your character must be able to plausibly be in Isra. The quest will be happening there. Your character must be able to fit through doorways designed for humans, and operate on a human scale. Doesn\u2019t really matter how, but if you can\u2019t fit inside the building, you can\u2019t come.Your character must not be totally inept. (Excluding\u00a0Royal Fletcher )Your character must not be too powerful, to the point where they can simply use brute force or powerful magics of some manner to make the whole endeavor trivial. (Excluding\u00a0Lum'Valia  and other such god-tier characters)Beyond that, I\u2019m easy. I\u2019m pretty good at fitting square pegs into round holes, and we could probably make it work. If you have a question about what sorts of characters may or may not be acceptable, ask. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s an existing character with 200+ posts, or someone you made in the last five minutes specifically for this quest. All that I ask is that you do your best, and that the character meets the guidelines above.Additionally, I ask that you be able to post at least once every two days. Inactivity breeds disinterest, and I\u2019d like to avoid that. If you know that you won\u2019t be able to post for an extended length of time sometime in the next month, I would ask that you sit this out in the interest of the others you would be keeping waiting.  If this interests you, I would ask that you contact me. With a PM to Naoki, or on skype (which is listed on my profile), or through some other messaging service. Posting on this thread and not sending me a message of some sort will not count. I intend only to take two, perhaps three characters on this little adventure, so it\u2019s possible that you won\u2019t be selected. I intend to start this properly next week, on Monday the 8th of August, 2016. Any messages should be sent before then, and I\u2019ll update this post at that time to say that the thing is started or canceled, as the case may be. If you have any questions, ask below.
