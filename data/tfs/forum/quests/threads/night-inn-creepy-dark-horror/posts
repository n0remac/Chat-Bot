I am a merchant with a company based in Glendale. My daughter, Delilah, went missing while traveling to one of the distributers I have a long standing business relationship with in Hickory Pointe. I was several weeks\u2019 journey away from Glendale when she went missing, and when word reached me I immediately began paying anyone willing to do so to look for my daughter. Off-duty guard detachments turned up nothing at all in their search of the surrounding wilderness, and a pair of private investigators returned with little more than word of someone giving an accurate description of the carriage my daughter was traveling in parked alongside the Travelers' Rest Inn.I am not a rich man, simply a humble merchant, and the search became too expensive to carry on in that manner. It was then with some regret that I grew desperate enough to employ mercenaries, and other of such filth, to continue the search. Some ignored my very strict instruction to simply look for my daughter, or gather what information they could, and even more simply took the money I was offering and left without another word.In truth I have very little left to offer. My business\u2019 funds have dwindled to almost nothing now, and I have spent most of my family\u2019s money on the search as well. As of my writing this letter, Delilah has been missing for a month with no word, and I am coming to grips with the grim reality that she is very likely no longer amongst the living. With these confessions, it is my hope that anyone reading this letter with the mind and ability to search for my beloved daughter will believe me when I assure them that I will give all that I have left for word of my daughter - be she alive or not.______________________________OOC:Howdy and Happy Taco Tuesday! As a preamble to the rumored forthcoming dark fantasy setting (really there aren\u2019t any rumors, I just keep saying that in hopes it\u2019ll just kind of happen.. sorry), I have devised a sort of jumping-off point for a creepy/dark/horror style quest!When I first had the idea, it only included one other person playing along, but it could be easily adapted for two if there\u2019s more interest! Also, it bears mentioning that I see this \u201cquest\u201d more as collaborative story writing with someone else rather than \u201cI have this idea, I\u2019m guiding someone through it\u201d. The only other thing I\u2019d add is that because this is supposed to be creepy/horror style storytelling, this probably isn\u2019t the best place for your unstoppable badass character - your unstoppable badass is awesome, but if you can decimate everything in your path and flatten the inn to nothing.. there\u2019s no reason for them to be creeped out. At any rate I don\u2019t immediately picture combat being the main focus anyway.That being the case, I will say that I\u2019m not interested in killing, maiming, or indefinitely imprisoning anyone\u2019s character, so don\u2019t be worried you\u2019re going to lose that character you think might be great, but don\u2019t want killed!TL:DR bullet points:-Creepy/horror style RP-Collaborative storytelling (read: \u201cstory idea pretty loose\u201d)-Not combat oriented-Maybe not a great place for unstoppable badass characters-Safe for your character! Not going to kill/maim/indefinitely imprison your characterIf you\u2019re interested:The only thing left to do is decide how your character winds up at the inn, and post there to begin! Did they find this letter posted at a tavern somewhere? Did some shady fucker slip the letter to them? Do they even know about Delilah and her merchant father at all? Maybe they don\u2019t know anything about the inn and just need a place to stay for the night.", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/2685/travelers-rest-inn"], "image_list": ["//storage.proboards.com/6046952/images/5AgYdAfn8rATue75bHkc.png"], "html": "<p>I am writing this letter and many like it to whomever may find it, however they may find it.<br><br/>My name is Thaddeus Bluff.
