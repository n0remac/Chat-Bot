These characters may be temporary or permanent, each player has the right to kill them off or leave the role-play. \u00a0Character 1: Gitmo Merosiky\u00a0linkGitmo is a long time friend, practically a brother. Gitmo is larger than rose, standing 6'1\" tall and weighing around 230 pounds that consists of solid muscle. His hair is Raven Black and runs half way down his back. Gitmo generally carries larger weapons such as maces, broadswords, battle hammers, battle axes, and is very talented with the long bow since he is capable of pulling back further than any archers in his tribe. Gitmo received his wolf at the age of 12 and hunts regularly.Character 2: Ayzum Merosiky\u00a0ImageAyzum's family moved to the Azoni 7 years ago from another tribe from a nearby valley. Rose's father saved him from a disorder that made him sick and almost die in the winter. Rose's father claims to have used Azoni remedies, but the truth was Rose's father using his blood magic to repair the blood since he knew the truth when he felt the anomaly in Ayzum's blood(sickle cell).\u00a0Ayzum retreated to magic, spending his time at the temple and studying magic. He has one of two Katanas in the valley. The piece was mostly decorative since Ayzum had never been in a fight that required him to draw the weapon. He stands about 6' even and around 200 lbs. Since the blood treatment, Ayzum has had white hair and silver eyes, commonly mistaken for a Merosiky by birth.\u00a0________________________________________________________During Rose's return to the Azoni, Gitmo and Ayzum were saved by Rose. A situation came about and Rose was forced to take certain actions that changed their lives forever. Gitmo, Rose, and Ayzum, will always be loyal to each other. Once the Azoni quest is over, Gitmo and Ayzum choose to take the Merosiky name.\u00a0If anyone is interested in playing these characters, leave a message below and I will answer them.\u00a0Click Here: Tribe of the Azoni", "link_list": ["https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/47/d9/6b/47d96b7c6b59d9b22da9c318adbd4d76.jpg", "http://images6.fanpop.com/image/answers/3045000/3045523_1350495958575.6res_432_300.jpg", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1719/tribe-azoni"], "image_list": [], "html": "In-character, Rose's story is developing and I will be needing two players to play two specific roles in Rose's story.
