I am looking to test one of my students against somebody of random skill. Thus it will be known that around the Oculus Solis Arena,\u00a0such a bout is being sought. I am looking for one person who can play as a random challenger to spar with my student.The pretense of the meeting is not important. If you feel you can/would do this but you do not have any characters available, a temporary character would be just fine. This is mostly just a theoretical test, and I don't expect it to have any lasting consequences on any character involved in the scene.", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/board/272/oculus-solis-arena"], "image_list": ["http://www.clipartsupply.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/6da9ce8dbc7c5c2d8d17692c03fd4140/A/R/AR36-SWORDS-01-RQ.png"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.clipartsupply.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/6da9ce8dbc7c5c2d8d17692c03fd4140/A/R/AR36-SWORDS-01-RQ.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/></div>"}, "post-62248": {"user": "The Guy", "user_num": 2177, "timestamp": "1490985621000", "message": "A random challenger you say?
