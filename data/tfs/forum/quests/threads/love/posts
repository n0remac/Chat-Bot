Ho-ho!  Today is your lucky day, my wispy....um....wisp!  For I, Birdi of the Seas, am a MASTER of love and romance! \u00a0You see, \"love\" is an emotion all life on the planet has towards someone they truly care about. \u00a0I had it with my own love of my life thousands of years ago, and I'm sure you're experiencing it right now with this...Andrew Astey fellow of yours! \u00a0your heart begins to flutter a little at the very thought of them, you yearn to be in their arms every day, you notice strange marks on their neck, and then suddenly THE WORM LEAPS FROM ITS THROAT! I remember the first time I dealt with my love parasite. \u00a0'Twas back when I was but a humble swashbuckler and master of the sword.\u00a0 Yes, I'm sure you remember the outbreak that happened 8571 years ago, to this day- the poor citizens of Lumberton had fallen prey to the dreaded love worm- a creature that infests your mind and makes you lustful for someone of the opposite gender. \u00a0Thankfully, those without specified sexes were unaffected, but for the humans in that town, it was as though they had become rabbits! I was passing through with my allies, Soda Jones the legendary paladin and \"Jeff\", the softspoken priest orc. \u00a0\"Jeff\" is what he wished to be called, as it turned out his name was a racial slur in every known language that exists, with the exception of Necril for some reason.But anyway! \u00a0We were passing through on our quest to defeat the fabled Mal Thrakka- a powerful orc leader who had stolen the Hand of God- a relic of unimaginable power, capable of destroying whole worlds! \u00a0Only we could be trusted with such a task! \u00a0But as we entered the town we noticed something was...unusual. \u00a0People were too happy, too hopeful for their futures. \u00a0They seemed to be grouped up two at a time and constantly cuddling one another in public and making googly faces at one another like love-struck teenagers! \u00a0A grim site indeed! \u00a0We stayed in the town for a good week as we resupplied and rested our weary bones, but it wasn't long until Soda Jones had caught the eye of a beautiful maiden! \u00a0This wasn't out of the ordinary for good ol' Jones, he was quite the ladies man. \u00a0The woman asked him to stay with him for the night, to which he naturally obliged. \u00a0 \u00a0Jeff and I remained, joking about Jones for most of the meal, before retiring to our own stay.In the middle of the night- I stayed on the bedside table to save money on rooms- we heard the door open quietly. \u00a0Jeff was the first to sit up to see who it was. \u00a0Jones had apparently come back from his, er, um....\"date\", early. \u00a0He said he was absolutely in love, to which we applauded him. \u00a0\"Good on you, dear chap!\" \u00a0Jeff said in his normal cheery voice. \"Will she be joining us on our quest? \u00a0I'm sure Birdi here would love a female companion to chat with.\"Naturally, I laughed it off. \u00a0I was one of the boys at that point, but something seemed...strange about Soda. \u00a0He didn't laugh with Jeff. \u00a0In fact, he sat on the end of the bed and continued to stare at Jeff.\"No, my friend, it's more than that.\" \u00a0Soda said in a stern voice that was, to be quite honest, a bit unsettling. \u00a0\"You see, I am actually fond of someone in this room. \u00a0It was only until now I realized it.\"\"Why, Jones, I'm flattered!\" \u00a0I called, blushing a bit. \u00a0I will admit Jones had been quite a handsome man in his youth, and even in old age he was a tease and a charmer. \u00a0Some days I would imagine us riding off into the sunset on a griffon- he was fond of the animal, not sure why, they've always been quite rude- as I cling to his long blonde hair and tell him stories of the adventures we would have. \u00a0And yet....it was not to be. \u00a0For you see, he pushed me away from himself and instead pointed towards Jeff. \u00a0\"No, my feelings are for....him.\" \u00a0Jones said affectionately. \u00a0I looked at Jeff confused, and Jeff looked at me in the same way. \u00a0We both knew something was wrong with Jones. \u00a0With my help, Jeff managed to hold Jones down as he looked all over for signs of mind control! \u00a0No such luck, however we noticed a peculiar cut in Soda's neck. \u00a0Upon further investigation, Jeff was able to conclude that it was the dreaded love worm! \u00a0He realized it would explain everyone's upbeat and unusually affectionate attitude. \u00a0What was most surprising, however, was it only worked on a heterosexual relationship. \u00a0As it turned out, Jeff was a woman all along! \u00a0I was shocked! \u00a0Shocked! Even with my acute perception I was unable to see the signs! \u00a0Between his gruff orcish voice, lack of hair on his head and full breasts, I couldn't tell he was a female orc!But that is a story for another day. \u00a0How did we defeat these monstrous parasites, you may ask? \u00a0Well, it was quite simple! \u00a0Jeff cast a sonic blast spell on Soda Jones, screaming into his ear with a high enough frequency to kill the worm and break the hold on his mind! \u00a0Jones was back to normal in no time, and with our ally restored we began to go from house to house, screaming at people until the worm inside their mind was killed! \u00a0With our help, we turned that happy-go-lucky couple's paradise into the disgusting fetid pit of depression and thievery it was known for! \u00a0All in a day's work for heroes, I suppose.The moral of the story? \u00a0Well, since you seem to be infatuated with this Annabel Lee, there is only one conclusion: YOU HAVE BEEN INFECTED BY THE LOVE WORM!\u00a0 But fear not! \u00a0For it is curable! \u00a0Simply find enough people to scream directly into your ear for prolonged amounts of time, and you'll be cured of the dreaded disease!", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "What is love, you ask?
