The sisters were speaking amongst each other, Kayako, Miyuri, and Ryoichi Masami  while Yuudai and Kayako's husband, Shinoku, discussed the meetings for the day. Yuudai's wife, younger than him by fifteen years and closer in age to his oldest daughter was quiet, and off to herself.A servant came to the family's table and quietly handed Yuudai a missive. \"What is that, Father?\" Asked Kayako. Masami frowned, unable to see.Yuudai did not answer, but a quiet came over the table. It was this quiet that stole Yuudai's young wife, Hanawari, from her reverie and she looked at her husband.\"Daimyo Zuikaku is in want of a wife,\" Yuudai said. Everyone knew what that meant. Masami's hands clenched a little tighter around her drink, for she knew that everyone was looking at Miyuri.The middle child, she was the only daughter left to marry off. Masami's blindness made her more trouble than she was worth. One day, perhaps, they might marry her to a less powerful but ambitious merchant family later on in life, but the daimyo?No, he would get Miyuri.\"What does that mean?\" Hanawari asked, wanting specifics.\"It means we prepare Miyuri and bring her to the Daimyo in due time,\" Yuudai said, taking his drink and beginning to eat his food again, as if this news was no more important than that of the weather or the harvest.\"Me?\" Miyuri asked, said to be the fairest of all the Ryoichi daughters. Masami wasn't even in the race, her blindness too large a flaw to be considered.Yuudai didn't answer, as it seemed obvious to him.\"But I don't have the proper clothes...\" \"You will.\"Kayako reached out and laid a hand on Miyuri's arm. \"How lucky you are, Miyuri. A Daimyo!\"\"It is not a victory yet. Shinoku,\" Yuudai said and left the table, leaving the women behind as his son in law fell into step. To have a Daimyo for son in law...
