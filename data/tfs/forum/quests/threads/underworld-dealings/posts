Despite a lack of any official channels, news in such circles has the habit of spreading just as if not more quickly than news going through legitimate channels. There are many ways one might have heard about this rumor, but regardless, the gist of it is the following. @maharet \u00a0has drawn the attention of someone in the underworld, someone very wealthy. A significant bounty has been placed upon her for whoever can capture her, with a promise of more than just gold for whoever brings her in alive and unharmed. Such a task would not be easy, however, for she is someone of importance in Sakand and is likely to be under heavy guard. Only professionals are recommended to attempt this task, although there\u2019s nothing to stop anyone from making an attempt. Anyone looking for more specific information on this bounty should speak to the Broker in\u00a0The Dwarven City of Khaldaruhm. He is currently staying in one of the more seedy taverns in the city and is also who Lady Maharet is to be brought to in exchange for the reward.", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/2630/dwarven-city-khaldaruhm?page=1&scrollTo=67742"], "image_list": [], "html": "A rumor is passing around through the less respectable parts of the world.
