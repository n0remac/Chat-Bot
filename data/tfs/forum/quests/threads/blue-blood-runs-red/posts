While some may have cast aspersions upon it, claimed that The City of The Sun cast a long and obtrusive shadow over the world there are none that can deny its power. It is an empire at its height and it has never faced any true tragedy. But that is about to change. Blue Blood is about to run red and Isra\u2019s defenders must be called to arms to face its first real challenge. Where does this foe come from? From within her very walls. Those who have consumed Blue Blood: Camaro (Dart) Maripha Lenny Labree Aldergaze Kali'Xena\u00a0Your debt is due.They and those citizens within the city who have imbibed the drug find their bodies burning, their minds consumed, their spirits bent. They are stronger, faster, and more powerful than normal people as though they just took a hit. But now there is a new effect, an overpowering rage, a desire to kill any and all they find in their path. If the source of this madness is not found or another cure offered then they will wreak untold havoc throughout the city. They will kill and destroy right up until their bodies give out as the magic that fuels them consumes their very lives. Good luck fair people of Isra, you will need it.", "link_list": ["/user/3661", "/user/3642", "/user/821", "/user/3663", "/user/3599"], "image_list": [], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><b><u><font size=\"5\">Blue Blood Runs Red</font></u></b></div>"}, "post-95765": {"user": "Shyv'ahna Tes'laya", "user_num": 3557, "timestamp": "1582422957000", "message": "Shyv\u2019Ahna, the Av\u2019 nomad, stands atop her cart as she prepares the last of her equipment, ready to move along to the next big place. Yule had been nice, yes, but she never liked to stay in Isra for too long. It had a certain stink of arrogance and that eternal desire for glamour and glory that turned her stomach if she stayed for too long. Most major cities did, but Isra is certainly the biggest. Why her sister Xena enjoyed coming here is beyond her. She ties down her newly filled water barrel and her food supplies, then puts her hands on her hips. Ah, finally. Finished. She would have to seek out Xena one last time to say goodbye before hitting the roads with the intention on going to the land of nomads, Toragana. It\u2019d been too long since she\u2019d travelled there, and it almost guaranteed some quiet time, and time among those like her, those that travel instead of stewing in the filth of greed and material possessions, and the ever looming jackboot of an authoritarian regime. The land of the truly free people. The tall Av\u2019 woman climbs off her cart and grabs her bardiche, never going anywhere without it, and slips it into position on her back and clips the little button that kept it in place, and allows her to retrieve it quickly. Now, where is-A searing pain shoots through her skull as she drops to her knees, holding her head in shock, pain, and anguish as she\u2019s flooded with feelings of rage, sorrow, confusion, and pain. Images flash in front of her, all heavily tinged with blue. Screams resound in her ears, most unfamiliar, but one rages above the others. The voice of Kali\u2019Xena. When the barrage subsides enough for her to stand, she gets to her feet and looks around desperately. Her tattoos and eyes glow as her magic channels, brought forward by the confusion, and sparks of lightning shoot along her arms and across her horns. Something is very wrong with Xena, something very very wrong. Her duty and oath must be fulfilled, she must protect her little sister at all costs. Her own magic seeps into her mind, quieting it just enough for her to see clearly. The mental connection between the two is strong, but through magic and a lifetime of honing her mental strength, Ahna finds her purpose, and that\u2019s to move swiftly. These are dangerous times, and she will not be stopped. With weapon now in hand, she runs through the streets, towards the source of her mental anguish. Static flares out around her as she runs, the anger in her veins pushing her magic outwards all around her, but she doesn\u2019t care. She has one thing on her mind. Save Xena.
