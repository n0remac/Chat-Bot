Some reports say that a new landmass has suddenly appeared which may be the cause, while others report no such findings. Nevertheless, all reports indicate that a strong magical signature has been detected in the general location of where the trading ships have been going missing at sea.Given the inconsistency\u00a0of these reports, The Soaring Wench and her crew have been commissioned by the various trading companies of the western sea\u00a0to investigate further. A small group of adventurers has also been requested to join the crew to explore any\u00a0potential new landmasses, should the reports that have indicated thus hold true. They will be rewarded handsomely\u00a0upon their return in the form of gold coin.The Soaring WenchOOC: This quest will be DM\u2019d through its entirety by me, Deep Blue . The storyline for the entire quest has been for the most part pre-planned to some extent but shall remain flexible throughout the story. This quest will offer mostly adventure, combat, as well as the exploration of the lore of a new land designed by yours truly. There are some things I would like to say here finally:1. For the sake of getting through this quest in a timely manner, the number of participants shall be limited to three.2. Participants will have a full three days at most (72 hours) to respond before they are skipped in the turn order to keep the story moving along. However, anyone thinking of joining this quest should be reasonably active (enough to post at least once a day). This doesn\u2019t mean post once every three days. 3. Characters used in this quest should not be too powerful. This quest was designed for characters around average levels of player character strength. Well, that\u2019s that. If anyone is interested they can reply to this thread here. If you are chosen to be in this quest you will be tagged in the intro thread. The quest shall begin with the posting of the intro thread on 5/19/17 at 12pm EST, and anyone interested has until then to post into this thread.\u00a0", "link_list": ["/user/1690"], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/8GaxwWP.jpg"], "html": "Trading ships have been going missing for many weeks now along\u00a0a certain trade route in the western sea off the coast of Isra.
