One nation under the Iron Rose, Queen Xiomara of Rond\u00f3n.A kingdom based on trade and a man's worth, versus a kingdom of older, more traditional values. Rond\u00f3n has the gold, they have the will, and they have the fiery temperaments of their people -- do well for Rond\u00f3n, do well for House Vinicio, and see your own house flourish.Yet, people know that you need not be Rond\u00ec to do well in the kingdom. Wandering warriors, mercenary troops, and able-bodied sea captains are making their way to the Palace of Thorns in Rond\u00f3n's capital city, for with a Letra deReina, they can become vassals under the Queen and carve out their own glories and destinies beneath the kingdom's verdant banner.Will you travel to Rond\u00f3n, and make a legend of yourself, adventurer?Conquest awaits!(Post here if you're interested, or post arriving IC to Rond\u00f3n here:thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/2469/fair-city-rond )", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/2469/fair-city-rond"], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/IzKfT6P.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/xcDsoE8.png"], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"180\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/IzKfT6P.jpg\" width=\"665\"/><br/></div>"}, "post-77720": {"user": "Adrian von Heschburg", "user_num": 643, "timestamp": "1515545024000", "message": "In an effort to garner support for the Brotherhood, rekindle the Order's military fervor, and improve their financial situation, Hochmeister Adrian von Heschburg is leading a contingent of Knight-Brothers and mercenaries to Rond\u00f3n, to assist in the struggle.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "In an effort to garner support for the Brotherhood, rekindle the Order's military fervor, and improve their financial situation, Hochmeister Adrian von Heschburg is leading a contingent of Knight-Brothers and mercenaries to Rond\u00f3n, to assist in the struggle."}, "post-77933": {"user": "The Kingdom of Rond\u00f3n", "user_num": 2185, "timestamp": "1515906222000", "message": "Scouts and lookouts upon Rond\u00f3n's fortified border report daily to their superiors on their findings, but it is said that the Iron Rose has the Eye that allows her to know impossible things, impossible outcomes, impossible futures told.Rond\u00f3n would be ready to receive such allies, and how best to implement them should they stay on course.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Scouts and lookouts upon Rond\u00f3n's fortified border report daily to their superiors on their findings, but it is said that the Iron Rose has the Eye that allows her to know impossible things, impossible outcomes, impossible futures told."}, "post-78311": {"user": "The Kingdom of Rond\u00f3n", "user_num": 2185, "timestamp": "1516319945000", "message": "theB A T T L E Sb e g i nBATTLE OF DREIGHA legion of the forces will be marching East to LaDeona (lah-day-ohn-ah) and sailing South East across the Ryel River to battle at the village of Dreigh (dray), Zephyr-controlled, where they will be met by Duke Nicolas Soult    's Rondi-Gauldish troops that have marched from Brais (brah-ees). Should the battle be won, Duke Nicolas will assume command, and march West to Shimar (shee-marr) and Hektok (hekk-tohkk).Zephyy support from Shimar, Hektok, and Rheum (rey-oom) may or may not come, depending on how quickly the battle can be won. Battles are expected in the fields and plains leading to Shimar and Hektok from the edge of the Annais (ann-eyes) Forest. (Open field battles, perhaps some \"trenched' warfare depending on magic levels, etc.)BATTLE OF BEORNA legion of the forces will be marching West to LaSancha (lah-sahn-shah) and sailing South across the Ryel River to battle at the village of Beorn (bay-orrn) and the tower of Koen (koh-ehn). There is expected to be heavy support from the capital city of Zephyr, and assault on these beaches will be hard and heavy. High casualties are expected for the Rondi, but so is victory. Alfonso de Rond\u00f3n     is expected to use his reputation and his skill to bring about said victory as leader of this strike.Zephyy support from either East or West of the Ryel River is not expected, as both Dreigh and the Contested Islands will also be having their own battles. (think World War 2 D-Day storming of the beaches. lots of heavy fighting, lots of heavy deaths, very very gruesome)BATTLE FOR THE CONTESTED ISLANDSA legion of forces will sail from DeJolla (day-hoi-yah) to the Contested Territories, tiing their arrival with a portion of the Cordoba Fleet that will sail from Baloncia (bahl-ohn-see-ah). The forces will take the Contested islands, keeping the attentions of Crestwatch and Starwatch so troops are not sent East to the Battle of Beorn. The islands are known to be hard to control, as other than short, light wooded forests and flat terrain, there is little to use to defend or to take -- but controlling these islands is imperative, as it will block support sailing East through the Ryel River.Zephyy support is expected from Zephyr, Crestwatch and Starwatch, towers and forts that are commonly equipped to deal with skirmishes and battles over said islands. (think the 'island hopping' of the Pacific Theatre during WWII in Japan)BATTLE FOR PORT CALARThe largest portion of the Cordoba Fleet, owned by Lord Cordoba, will sail from Baloncia to Port Calar (p-ohrt kahl-arr), one of Zephyr's largest cities. Naval battles will most assuredly take place, and it is imperative that the city not be completely destroyed, as it is a valuable source of income that Rondon hopes to annex into its own trade routes.Zephyy support is expected from Zephyr and Rheum (rey-oom). (think \"pirate\" raids onto fortresses -- attacks from ships while raiding through the city and surrounding shanty towns)CURRENT PLAYERS:Eric     - ENLISTED - put into infantry / front linesGabriel Taurtoya     - ENLISTED - put into infantry / front linesMerryman Humour     - ENLISTED - put into arcane forces Jack     - ENLISTED - put into infantry / front linesSincarro     - ENLISTED - put into infantry / front lines@mireia     - ENLISTED - hiding her identity - put into infantry/ front linesKirian Krysin   - ENLISTED - put into infantry / front lines@diego     - OFFICER - lieutenant cavalry serving under Duke Nicolas Soult @soraya     - OFFICER - arcane commander into BeornDuke Nicolas Soult     - OFFICER - commander of the Eastern land assault into ZephyrAlfonso de Rond\u00f3n     - OFFICER - commander of the legion to attack the Battle of BeornRoxanne Fletcher     - OFFICER - commander of the marines / land forces that will be pillaging Port CalarWindfeld 'Sea-shrieker'     - OFFICER - first mate to Crown Prince Rafael Vinicio     in their mission to attack and hold the Contested IslandsCrown Prince Rafael Vinicio     - OFFICER - Crown Prince and commander of the Western land assault into ZephyrFeanor Vala  - OFFICER - Captain of the Elven Rangers of MithlondeCity of Khaldaruhm     - ALLIES - will be used for engineering and weapon support across each battleCity of Mithlonde     - ALLIES - will be used for magical support across each battleCURRENT POSITIONING / RANKING:BATTLE OF DREIGHCommander: Duke Nicolas SoultOfficers: Lt.

You do not have to post into the Fair City, but message me directly -- either on this thread, through personal messages on TFS, or on the TFS Discord (we have a Rondon room where we are discussing things in real time as well) -- so we can work out the \"how\" and \"why\" of your character OOC. Then, you can just jump right in ICly!And another friendly reminder that the purpose of this quest is to bring the \"Zephyr\" lore to a close. It was supposed to be a kingdom run by a friend of mine who is too busy to be involved, so I am trying to cleanly close out this 'chapter' of Rondon's history and ultimately make it its own kingdom on the board. Ergo, I will not have Zephyr winning the war, no revenge plots on Zephyr's behalf, and there won't be any in-depth lore for Zephyr. In the future, I'll expect Rondon to be getting into more battles / wars with other PC Nations, but for now, this NPC Nation is going to eat our shorts.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><font size=\"7\">THE WAR HAD BEGUN<br/></font></div>"}}
