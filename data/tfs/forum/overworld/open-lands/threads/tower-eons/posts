The doors were easily twelve foot tall.  As She entered the room , light came for its normal source, the torches that followed her it seemed...

The Hall was a short one compared to the entrance, only a few paces ,faintly lit by the flickering torches. When Dorian came to the room, he\u2019d find a camp. Kaine\u2019s camp. It was still rather fresh, scorch marks on stone, cookware left faintly warm, there were packs sitting next to a bed roll by the pool of water. The pool of water was shallow, maybe a foot and a half deep , but it was wide enough to lay in.

Chances are they held some sort of magic that helped to deter adventurers and robbers but Nel was no mage. She has delved into ruins like this before, well not quite like this, and they were often filled with artifacts that would sell decently to the right buyer. Certainly more that she could make off of peddling pelts. After but a moment's hesitation Nel decided that she would at least scout it out. If it proved too dangerous she would simply sleep in the threshold of the entrance, just out of the night. With some luck her deer escaping wouldn't mean she was out of a payday.She proceeded into the tower. Each step was soft and quiet. Her bow was knocked and ready.

With the torch now lighting her way, and sadly revealing her position to whatever may be in the dark,\u00a0 she approached the end of the hall coming to the second egress. Her bow was still mostly ready, its nocked arrow still in place. It would take but a moment to drop the torch and bring her bow to bear.She found it strange. The light from her torch didn't seem to penetrate the threshold. She was about to investigate when she noticed the runes.

She stepped through the portal, the aforementioned chills sending a potent and unexpected shiver through her. She pulled her hood a bit tighter around her head but it didn't seem to help. She proceeded to inspect the room thoroughly deciding best to check out the the one lit area last. Bringing the dulled torch to bear upon the tapestries marveling at the tales. As she walked along the walls where the woven legends hung, Nel realized the just how large the room was, \"How is this possible? The tunnel I came through seemed to span the width of the tower.\" The runes of the rooms portal came to mind. Perhaps she was in over her head, \"Perhaps the ghosts here aren't ghosts at all.\" She made her way to the obelisk and inspected it. Nel's face became grim as the writing became clear, \"Are these the names of people who died here?\" If the tapestries were a monument to the people who entered this tower... Well not all of them ended well. However a few showed victory, gains of rewards of treasure and knowledge. The ways forward were obvious but at this point she was already moving for the door.

She would feel Jin's eyes on the back of her head, yet if she looked back it would almost be as if he was looking through her, what some might consider a grim expression hung on his face. Now that she was closer she could see the strain in his eyes... the tiredness of his gaze.  A hearth blazed to life as they entered the next room, casting enough light to see the room clearly. They entered what seemed to have been a large dinning room suggested by the large maple table. The table in the center of the massive room could have easily fit thirdy guest. The table was lined with silver plates,and aside from food,  it was like guest had simply stopped eating and were out else where in the tower.  At the head of the table was a massive chair , quite easily considered a throne by the ornate wood and cloth work. A hawk clutching a spear in its talons was embossed into the back of the massive chair. Behind the chair a typist, a man holding an elegant sword posed stoically , and seemed to leer down at the table. The fire light caught something else however... A red glint caught the young huntress eye... A Dagger with a ruby the size of a sparrow's egg was embedded in the table opposite the massive chair.  Upon setting her eyes on this dagger, she would feel an unease take her... It may have been Jin behind her, but perhaps not.  Yet there was something... intoxicating about this room.  A rush of excitement, yet that sense of dread. It was enough to give anyone a headache. \" Next door... this room is too dangerous for even one such as me..\" he ushered her along... stepping well away from the dagger's resting place. The next room he lead her to was likely a cooks dinning area, much smaller , a nook almost. The table was set for a single person, an iron dutch oven was sitting on a mat in the center of the table.  \" Hope you don't mind a think soup and coarse bread... There is only so much magic can do with garbage.\" He said looking at the pot wishfully. \" Oh here. \" He said, dusting off a wicker chair and moving it beside the table.

His own haggard eyes reflecting the light exactly like her own. Despite the grim expression and tired eyes this was really the first time she got a look at him and handsome was more than an adequate word to describe him. As they entered the next room she furrowed her brow. It felt familiar. Exhilarating yet dangerous, she whispered to herself, \"I feel like in the middle of hunting a bear. A bear that's hunting me back.\" No sooner than she finished talking did her gaze settle upon the dagger. It's gem mesmerizing. Luckily her chauffeur broke it's spell and continued their journey forward.She let loose a soft chuckle, \"I eat dried meat and berries almost entirely so you won't find me complaining about food.\" Nel frowned slightly embarrassed about earlier, \"Particularly when I've been so rude already.\" She took her quiver off and leaned it against the chair, along with her bow.

Nel kept her reasoning to herself in regards to the other room Best to push it from my mind, she reasoned. She watched him move as he prepared their meals.

Even as he set the food in front of her, against her stomach's will, she did not take a bite. No, she waited for him to take one. Something she began practicing when eating alongside strangers after hearing some rather disturbing stories during one of her rare trips to a town. Trips usually to buy supplies and sell her furs and meats. The man spoke and his words had a strange ring to them. Like she was something abnormal. She gave him a strange look as he took a bite. How would he know anything about me? His continued remark did nothing to alive her of the thought. Her stomach however overpowered her mind and she took a greedy bite of the hardy soup. She savored the flavors. The difference between the soup's flavor and her usual cuisine of preserved meats and berries was so blatant that Nel's face became a picture of joyous pleasure. Pleasure that for a moment took away the thoughts of being in a mythical tower. Sadly the moment faded beside the flavor and Nel returned to reality from her food fueled bliss.

She was almost mesmerized by the way he moved. There almost seemed to be more vigor in his actions. She listened intently to his instructions and repeated them to herself to devote them to memory, \"Death is lie... Wait here for you if I perish... Tell the woman, 'No.'\" She did have questions. None of them were of great import.Jin gestured to the door, a wide sweeping motion more like a bow than anything save for his eyes locked on hers. They seemed  a blaze compared to the hollow nature they had before... \" No questions?\" He mused, seeing the hints of confusion in her face. Nel noticed the blaze. This ring must mean a lot to him. A small smile sneaked its way onto her face and she answered quickly, \"I'm sure you can answer them as we move.\" Was this really going to happen? Will I get the answers I have sought my whole life? Anticipation built in her a bit, however a small nagging voice would remind her that she was out of her element, that the man was a stranger, and that this entire ordeal was a matter of great danger. Risk it all, she reminded herself, that's what your doing and that's what is required. The smile never faded through her thoughts and she met the man's eyes with blaze of her own and much higher spirit than their previous conversation had led.  With a nod she spoke, \"Lead the way.\" She nocked a simple broad-head into her bow in case \"those that lurk\" crossed their path. The mage's lip twitched , a smile different from his fair spirit... Amusement perhaps? \"You're far more accepting then others that have chosen this path. \" He said leading the way.     The short hallway, once again spotless... and once again those torches flickered to life at their passing...  Again came the dinning room.      The sense of being hunted over took our huntress the moment she stepped foot in the doorway... as if a  Grizzly cub was playing in the river before here...and her mother was not in sight...    The Fire light caught the dagger hilt again... A strange sense of dread and longing reached for our young archer.  The ebony hilt wrapped in a sickly black cloth... Dark stains hinted at a hand clutching the blade... faint red tint suggested its composition.      \" Lovely isn't it... \" Jin glared at the knife, as if it had done him a personal wrong doing...     \" Nasty thing... Even for the tower...\" he said watching Nel closely... As if waiting...     \"Shame... this room holds much importance to a number of people... Much to learn if you're  inclined... \" He added. Nel entered the room now for a second time and while the hair on the back of her neck stood at attention and her grip on the bow tightened she reacted little to the strange aura the room seemed to house. Nel's eyes drifted to the dagger, last time it nearly escaped her notice and she had paid it little mind, \"What's so terrible about it?\" She understood magic worked in strange ways, probably stranger still within this mighty structure that reached up to touch the sky, but how could a simple dagger be so nefarious? She failed to realize that as she thought more about it her left hand was slowly reaching out. As if it had a mind of its own and wanted to feel the wait of the beautiful thing in its palm.The mage paused... mid stride and looked at the dagger. \" What happens when you release a weed not native to a forest, into the forest.... Or a predator a land has never seen before?\" He asked her , his eyes never strayed for the dagger... yet his sword hand sat on the pointed pommel of the sword he wore... Focused... that was the best expression for how his eyes watched....his brow furrowed and his lips scowled ever so slightly. \"The weeds spread like wildfire and the predators devour all they can.\" Nel withdrew her hand from its daring closeness to the blade and fell to her side. \"We should keep moving,\" she looked at the mage and for the firs time noticed his regard toward the weapon and with a bit of concern she pressed the issue, \"We should really keep moving. Lead on.\" \" Correct on both accounts.... Now apply what you said to Magic... and you'll start to understand what is so foul about that blade..\"  He lead them through the Dinning room with the dagger, through the first hallway Nel had crept through aside from her entrance into the grand tower... The sensation of being watched did not falter... though instead of waiting in ambush , what ever cast eyes upon Nel.... hid from Jin.  Unseen eyes in the pale grey shadows... \"Can you feel them?\" He asked. Walking past the monument... not glancing twice at the magnificent pool of light and stone... Instead he moved to the large double doors  just behind the monument... A curious lock was baring the way.  \" Or do you hear them? I've heard some say they hear the voices before the eyes, but the opposite happens from time to time.\" He mentioned, taking a key from his belt pouch... a very odd key with two prongs.  The door's lock spun as the key was twisted... and then separated seamlessly in two... The doors inched open.  No light was on the other side of the threshold... No torches lit their way... only an icy blackness loomed before the two. \" Ladies first.\" he mused, casting her a side long gaze, the frayed edges of a smile darting across his lips. Nel nodded, the feeling of these eyes had accosted her last time she was here. It had set her on edge and her companion nearly got an an arrow because of it. Her lack of words was habit more than anything. Years of hunting left a practiced silence within her. Her head cocked to the side when he produced a key. This was a path that would have been impossible for her to take without his help. Eyla took the lead as he directed, pulling her bow string back ready to fire at anything that dared jump out and threaten her. Each step into darkness pressed her senses. It was dark, her eyes were not reliable. Her bow was not reliable truly, but her ears pierced the darkness, a hidden ability to hear better than men. The Door closed behind the pair, a hollow thud assured there was no turning back at this point.  embers formed on the walls, and slowly light filled the small room.  Jin's work more than likely as it lacked the aggressiveness of the tower... And hinted at caution. Before the huntress was  a statue... A lion , one paw raised and maw open.  There was scripture carved into the base of the statue, it seemed to writhe and wriggle under her gaze... slowly becoming readable.. but instead Jin's voice cut the silence short.   \" Place thy forearm within the maw.\" \" Thy toll : one of one hundred\" \"Thy reward is all to one\"Do you understand the price?\" He asked looking at her expectantly...\" And do you wish to continue?\" He asked raising an eyebrow. Was he judging her? What was that expression... ?When light sparked to life and the lion shape began to form Nel aimed her bow to it's center. However the light would soon reveal that it wasn't alive or rather that it didn't seem alive. At least now she could see. Nel lowered her bow from it's ready position as her partner spoke. Nel replied simply, \"Would it matter? If that's the price it must be paid.\" She placed her left forearm into the maw without hesitation. The thought of loosing an arm to the lion was there but if death was an illusion then surely being maimed was temporary. Surely...", "link_list": ["/post/71248/thread", "/user/2332", "/user/2414", "/user/2414", "/user/2332"], "image_list": ["//storage.proboards.com/6046952/avatar/NMfGMMQxQcPBRMMPTEbG.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@tower\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/71248/thread\" timestamp=\"1501782940\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-2332\" title=\"Tower of Eons\"><img alt=\"Tower of Eons Avatar\" src=\"//storage.proboards.com/6046952/avatar/NMfGMMQxQcPBRMMPTEbG.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/71248/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1501782940000\" title=\"Aug 3, 2017 9:55:40 GMT -8\">Aug 3, 2017 9:55:40 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-2332 group-0\" href=\"/user/2332\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@tower\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Tower of Eons</span></a></span> said:</div><span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-2414 group-0\" href=\"/user/2414\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@nel\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Nel</span></a></span>   A story all her own <br><br/>\" Alright then... \" Jin said moving to a wardrobe that was nestled in the corner of the room. <br/><br/>\" We can avoid some of the first levels of the tower, it is designed to be moved through quickly. <br/>If you've been there before, though that its self has a cost.\" He said , taking a red wood scabbard from the cabinet and belting it to his side, it looked a tad strange on him, not that the scabbard was odd.

Still though she would continue, \"Well, why haven't you left?\"<br/><br/>\"I said I had to pay a price didn't I?\" He answered or at least it sounded like an answer. <br/>\" With any lucky my price will be paid eventually and I will be free to wander the world again.

One might have forgotten they were in the tower at all... Which brough up a question...Why would anyone want to leave?  \"Here.\" Jin said, moving a large bit of foilage from the path.     There was no clearing, nature had reclaimed any and all space that was not occupide by the stone work before them, and even then the thick moss and ivy threatened to conceal the structure entieraly.  It was a two floor building, or was, not much larger than most taverns.     The door sat crooked, hanging by one hinge, or perhaps solely by the plant life attempting to choke the life out of it.  There were no windows, no other paths in it seemed.      \" The alter should be in there, though we've not met the task at hand, which will lead us to a way to unlock the alter within..\" He explained moving to the doorway. Nel nodded to the man's explanation. \"With two of us the task will hopefully be a breeze.\" She approached the door, passing closely to Jin in the process. She did her best to peek past the door before opening it. Nothing seemed to stick out so she found a good grip on the door and pried it open. It gave way rather easily but Nell grunted with effort as she freed it from the grip of the vines. Jin moved to assist with the door , simply moving above Nel's handy work with his height. Nel was focused on there task was unaware of how close he had truly gotten. However she took a small step back as the door finally gave, bumping against Jin. Moving on reflec jin caught her in his arms, crossed over her to keep them both from falling. \"Easy there, can't help me if you break your neck.\" He muttered looking down at her, brows furrowed.

Tables were arranged neatly benches lined them. Nature had started reclaiming the inside of the building, the wooden floors were as much dirt as they were timber.    The mage followed Nel closely, holding out his hand. Embers began to dance from his palm... and slowly birthed a flame which cast a little more light on the subject.   The room was filthy... cob webs lined everything... save for the double door at the far end of the building. It was an exact copy of the one Jin had a key for on the first floor. She crossed her arms and observed him at work. She marveled for a moment at his magic, it always fascinated her seeing it at work.\" Can you use any magic at all?\" He asked seeing the awe on her face. She nodded, \"I have a few arrows that are imbued with magic, I can recite a number of spells to shape it how I need but I have no idea how to make more.

Two keys...\" he corrected.\" I suppose that makes sense.\" he mused. \"That would be nice...\" Nel listened to him describe magic and the image shaped in her mind.

Too much time hunting things that want to hunt you will do that.\" She began to strut to the right end of the tavern, looking for any shape of the key through the thick layers of cobwebs covering the rotting tables. As she went she would occasionally see a shape and remove the dusty collective, sadly only finding rusty and tarnished silverware. \" It will not be here, likely it will be with whom ever you must save, the tower has a sense of humor like that...\" Jin said looking out the doorway, as if he had heard something stirring in the underbrush, but he turned back to the hunter. \" It will be dark within two hours... we should not be out past sundown...\" He said moving to the door....He watched her for a moment \" Repeat the plan to me.\" He said, in a tone a master might use with a novice learning their runes.

Bow out and knocked, a hand on the string ready to launch, she proceeded with the speed and grace only an entire life amongst the forest could grant. Eye sharp and experienced looked closely at the ground before each step then forward and around in quick order looking for anything that would give sign of civilization or natural oddity.

Some kind of illusion or construct of the tower she had found herself in.    A gust of wind seemed to answer Nel's thought, and with it the scent of distant rain hammering the country side.  How long would she have before it began pouring? There had not been thunder to lead her a hint... Though a hint was in front of her.Before her were several snapped twigs... about knee height... and some about shoulder level. Leaves twisted back , or broken off. Whom ever had been through here was not exactly skilled in the wood crafts... Should she peer closer at the ground she might make out faint foot prints, longer than her own foot, but not extremely deep. They lead forward... Nel grimaced at the smell. Rain. Rain dampens all senses. Better move before then. Her eyes moved onto the trail she had come to. She observed the tracks and the signs. A child and.. something else. Another person? The prints were soft. A hunter then. If so the hunter was chasing the child. A skilled hunter wouldn't crash through the brush like this unless chasing after their prey. With that thought it dawned on her that the child was the prey. Nel's eyes narrowed slightly. Despicable. She began to follow the trail with a swiftness that left her earlier pace well behind. It was easy to move fast and quiet when a trail was already made for you.The trail twisted and turned , over logs and over brush...  Torn bits of fabric... Blood, now blackened with age. This had happened a while ago... The trail did not stop until a clearing was reached... A small one , there were tracks everywhere, splashes of blood, torn fabric, a broken dagger.... There were more tracks leading away from the fight... and it seemed something was being drug behind whom ever had made the tracks. As Nel entered the clearing she stopped. The vision played out before her. This was a killing ground. Nel's eyes wandered to the dagger. At least they went out fighting. Her gaze followed the tracks. She was in whoever or whatever did this' territory. With the signs of age from the fight she proceeded with more caution. Still swift and quiet but far more alert than she had been. Whatever did this couldn't be far. Indeed they were not far... as the faint smell of smoke made its way to Nel's nose not much sooner than voices danced just beyond her hearing.She was getting close. The smell of smoke would be her guide. She moved of the trail into the undisturbed forest. She moved slowly now, favoring stealth over speed. All but walking on all fours, she was low to the ground. Her bow was still ready. Her senses were on edge. With her speed hampered she came closer to the source the sounds of voices and dancing grew clearer and clearer, dampening the sounds of the forest around her slightly.

It was not made extremely well, but was very practical, three tens spaced out around the fire, a stack of wood  on on side, and the three figures huddled around a large cauldron.The figures were human like, likely not much taller than nel, but their grey green skin instantly disqualifed them as such... as did their knife like ears and lack of proper hair. They wore armor, crudely made by the looks of it, and all were armed. One leaned against a spear and buckler,  He was the shortest of the group. The stern one carried a war hammer and sword breaker. The last carried a bow and something wrapped around his hands... Though all this would not matter... as nel looked, she would see a young girl dressed in no more than rags bound and gaged sitting inside one of the tents... Her red hair was damp with blood from a blow to the head, and covered in mud.  She was at the backs of the creatures. Her chest heaved laborusly, but at least it moved... She was still alive. Nel knit her brows. From cover it would be easy to kill the creatures and free the girl. However, why risk the fight? Nel removed her current arrow from her bow and placed in her quiver, swapping it out with one of her magically infused arrows. After she nocked the arrow she whispered ever so quietly to it in a sing song: Burn bright as the sun, roar louder than thunder. The arrow would shimmer slightly. A simple spell for a simple effect. One she hoped would not be needed. The large creatures ears twiched , shooting upright. \"Aye , you lot hear that?!\" He said looking around, yet he did not turn around. Nel's eyes squinted but she froze completely. Sharp ears that one. She would have to be careful with the plan already forming in her head.\" There ain' nothing there ya sod.\" The spearman said. \" Sure t'eres is, just like t'eres was somethin' when he was jumpin at a wee tree rat!\" The one stiring the pot said, causing a laugh from the spearmen. \"Ahaha! Oh ooo... Ooo... Mags always loved teasin ya 'bout that!\" \"Shat Up ya sod!.... Sides... Mags ain't 'ere no more...\" The large creature said... a heavy saddness crept into its tone... A quiet moment passed between the three of them... \" I'll grab some more wood, don't wan the fire goin out 'alf way through.\" The spearman said... leaving the clearing to gather more wood.The remaining two just stared at each other...

It seemed he had not discovered her and she continued her soft steps toward the tent in question. Upon getting as close as she could without breaking her cover she would watch and wait. The other one would be back soon and it was imperative that the three of them were all present for her strategy to work.    The two creatures seemed to share a quiet moment, though a snort broke the silence.     \" Ain't noffin' we gon talk about Fes? \" The one with bindings around his hands asked the warhammer wielder.  \" Not like noffins to be talked 'bout.  Mags wouldn't wan us to dwell. Ya know how she be.\" The two creatures let the silence hang in the air... The wind swirling and fire crackling were the only sounds.The girls head lulled, still faced away from Nel. Now that Nel was closer she would see iron bindings snapped firmly around the young girls wrist, so tightly the flesh had bulged and turned purple from the force. The girl couldn't have been very old...  Another shape might catch her attention.  A human like shape covered by a sheet stained with dark red pools... It did not stir. Nel's gaze shifted from her assumed enemy to the prisoner and tent before her. She looked at the prisoner first, she seemed mostly fine save for the discoloring on her wrists that Nel could see from her position. Nel noticed with grimace that her bindings were iron. Troublesome. Nel's gaze began to search the tent however when her eyes drifted to what was clearly body a grim look settled upon her. So was that \"Mags\" or a different unfortunate victim? That was the question. Still Nel realized that she may have trouble with the iron cuffs. However with a time limit steadily encroaching, alongside bad weather and the night, she would have to worry about the cuffs later. Still she was waiting on the other goblin to return from his chore.As Nel looked at the cuffs. she might notice something twinkle... Much like stars do on a cloudy night, it was barely there...but she could see it. Now that she really started paying attention to the bindings she would see there were no key slots... and infact the bindings seemed to be made of a single slab of iron with no hindges what so ever... Like it was part of the girl.     The third goblin wandered back with a bundle of twigs, his Green eyes slid right past Nel and the prisoner... As if she had not been there at all.      \"Back so soon? Dobber\"  Fes asked.     \" Yeah yeah... Just ain't thrilled at the prospect...Some 'imes I wish he'd left us be.\"     \" Can be wishin for th'ings ta happen diffrence once theys done already happen.\" Fen said as if quoting a book.     \" Aye , but a bum leg still hurts when ya wanna run\"     \" Fair point.\"      The three of them prodded at the fire... No one seemed eager to do anything. Infact they seem to be avoiding whatever they deemed \"  best to do it sooner than late any 'ow. \"Nel listened to them. What were they putting off? Better to not find out. All three were there, now was the time. She snuck from her cover and approached the tent doing her best to stay in whatever shadows the fire mercifully left her. As she entered the tent she place a hand over the prisoner's mouth, not wanting her to scream if she was conscious. If she wasn't conscious this could get much more complicated. There was no stir from the girl, and her skin would feel wet and cold to Nel's touch... bordering slimy. She had gone unnoticed yet... as the three simply prodded the fire. Nel frowned. Of course she's unconscious, why wouldn't she be unconscious? More importantly what was wrong with her skin? Still she had to try and wake her up.

The following is a collection of post for the user Nel and Tower of Eons. A scene with a fair bit of funny in it for all those who are bored) The Creature with the war hammer bolted in front of the archer raising the war hammer with a surprised yell. The archer jumped back knocking an arrow faster than he could land, and the spear wielder ran to flank the war hammer wielding beast---- only to trip on his friends boot, and land head long into the mud. Cold angry yellow eyes stared down the intruder... There was something else.... Was it fear?\"Fes.... get up.\"   The archer said calmly... _________________________For all their sluggishness the three----the two of them seemed well together in terms of a fight.  Though they did not attack... They seemed cautious of Nel... like one might a viper. Nel maintained her meek smile. This was not quite what she expected but that was a good thing. \"Er... So... Why do you trolls have a girl bound up in your camp?\"_________________________\" Ayye, Drop it...\" the archer commanded, gesturing at her bow now that he could see her weapon. \"Oi.... did 'He' just call us trolls?\" The war hammer asked the spear men as he scrambled upwards into  a defenseive position, it wasn't much louder than a whisper, but could be clearly heard by every one in the camp._________________________Nel raised an eyebrow at the archer and she shook her head no. Her eyes trained themselves between his fingers on the string and his eyes. She repeated her question a bit less meek this time, her smile becoming a neutral line on her face, \"Why do you have a girl bound and captured in your camp?\" Nel made a lighting quick glance at the one that called her \"He.\"_________________________The spear men leaned closer to the warhammer wielder \" I think she did...\" \" Can it. Ain't non ya buisness who we may or may not 'ave bound in our camps. Mind ya what ya doin tress passin on privat proptay? Hmm?\" He replied turning his lips down in a frown and rasing his chin and a single eye brow with an expectant look in his yellow orbs. _________________________\"I followed the signs of a hunt, something large chasing something like a child. It led me here. Why are three big fellows like you hunting someone like her?\" She would normally have pointed at the tent but making a move with an arrow pointed at you is not the best idea. \" Ya ain't from 'round 'ere is ya? Look , Ain't no sense tryin' be prince charmin and save the lady. Ain't no lady be saved. \" The archer said.  \" Just a killer.  You seened it ya self. Mags layin over there, I heard ya fusssin 'round back ere. Ya ain't did nothing stupid back there dia ya? Like touch the cuff or nothin?\" Concern started to form on the archers face.  The Spear men and warhammer wielder shifted their attention from Nel... to the tent. The girl was gone..._________________________Nel's expression changed often as the archer spoke. Her eyebrows furrowed at first realizing that these trolls had somehow mistaken her for a guy. However her eyebrow unknit and rose in a bit of shock, 4 on 1 and the girl still took one of them out. The expression remained as she answered his question, \"I tapped her face trying to wake her, I didn't touch the cuff though, why?\" She, unlike the other two, had no inclination that the girl was gone. How could she be?_________________________\" ohhhh\"  The spear wielder fes said. No longer concerned with Nel... turned his back to his friend with the war hammer.... eyes searched the trees. The war hammer wielder turned slowly as did the archer All of them wore an expression of fear. \" I got a bad feelin' bout dis Fes..\" Ches, said gripping his war hammer tightly. \" One hundard and fifty burning percent sure ya ain't touched it !? Not a hair!? Not a brush ? Nah a tap?!\" The archer said in a harsh whisper his back now with his brothers, scanning the trees. \" What ya doin get here and watch!\" Fes said to nel , looking at her like she was wearing breeches on her head. _________________________Nel started was more confused than ever. Still she knew what she was seeing. This was fear, fear of a predator. \"I did not touch the cuff,\" she said as she moved close to them and put her backs to theirs, glancing around the forest. \"Why are you so frightened of her?\" Despite her confusion, and the odd switching of sides, her ears were tuning to the forest. No birds chirpped.... No insects stirred... The wind did not even stir. She frowned, definitely a loose predator. What did she almost loose?_________________________\" Ain't know a word ya might know em by. \"  Ches said trying to keep his breathing steady.Nel would spot the child... The girl stood about ten paces away. Bright blue eyes watched NelHer features were soft and beautiful, if you could considered  children beaituful. Golden hair framed her face.  Her head turned slightly aside, like a bird looking at a worm.Her hands rested at her sides... the cuff was missing. \" Ain't no one move a cunts 'air\" The archer said every so gingerly raising his weapon, hidden behiend Nel's back. The creak of leather would be loud in her ear however... and the warmth of a hand resting near her head would hint that he had raised his weapon. _________________________Nel was frozen in place, even her expression froze. Whatever the girl was, the way she moved, the way her blue eyes looked at them. Her heart beat was strangley heavy in her chest. The sound of him preparing his weapon was like thunder to her. Hey eyes never left the blue orbs that looked at the party like nothing more than a snack. Emotionless and hungry. Nel's sharp hearing would catch the archer mumbling. _________________________\"Be not far from me' trouble is near, haste 'ee ta help m'. Blessing by t' lightfor givin' m' strength ta my fing'ers and truth ta' mah sight' guide m' hand now forIt is thee whom I' seek refuage.. m' 'igh tower, m' wall, ---\"  The air around Nel's head grew cold. The snap of the bow came first. The girl's face twisted in a scowl as she moved as the fletchings cleared Nel's shoudler... The arrow inched forward at a painful speed, as the girl bared teeth. Her mouth split her face nearly in two. Cracks ran along her pale flesh like fractured glass. Red wiry muscle steamed benith. The razored point cut through a lock of golden hair in passing. The next heart beat the girl was missing....  The forest became a roar of snapping twigs and snarls. _________________________Nel's eyes flashed to follow its movements. They only caught it moving into the forest, little more than a blur. It was in the forest and running, her ears could hear it well, very well. It seemed she had a moment to ask a quick question, \"What forest spawned monster was that?\" She looked over her shoulder, her eyes glowing a golden yellow, \"I have never seen anything like that.\" Her brows rose in realization, \"I... I didn't know.\"_________________________\" apologize later, survival now. Stay sharp she likes to attack from above. \"  The archer said, knocking another arrow. \" We need to find that cuff... only way ta subdue the blasted thing, then we gots ta dunk 'er in ta pot to finish it off. Other wise we're just pissin 'er off. \"Nel's focus returned to the forest, her ears listening to anything, anything at all that could reveal a possible attack. Her hearing peirced the surroundings like a wolf. She raised he bow, ready to launch and arrow. \"If I fire my shot, cover your ears and look away.\" Her tone was commanding and factual.

Expecting an encampment, what he saw instead was most peculiar, breathtaking; Voidclaim couldn't believe his eyes at first. There were eight shapes, two carrying torches in their arms... However, they were not Humans. What were they, he couldn't tell, they would look like normal men if one ignored all of the animal parts. The twisted, abominable hybrids of Human and creature were clad in black armor and armed with curved, large blades, aswell as a quiver of dark arrows, adding more gloom to the already mirk nightfall.These... things, were also very large, much taller than Voidclaim himself, who was a tall man indeed. They seemed to be looking for something, or someone. Scouts, perhaps? Were they mages, they'd be using robes and staffs, were they warriors, they'd be using heavy weapons and armor instead of a bow and a sword with chainmail. Their equipment and behavior implied that they truly were scouts of some sort. Well, then, his adversaries caught up to him at last. A Human in his right minds wouldn't attack a stranger for no reason, after all. Not to mention one of them was carrying a horn at their belt. Unfortunately, while Voidclaim thought about this, his position was unveiled to the horrendous beings, for the one whose head was that of a boar gazed in his direction. It was unclear for Voidclaim what should he do in this situation. If he chose to ran, the beasts knew exactly where he was going, but if he could lose them, the shadows were on his side, at least. The fact that the hybrids were equipped with torches didn't help, however. Combat was a valid option, but Voidclaim was greatly outnumbered and completly unaware of his enemies' capabilities. He could always try talking to them, but that didn't work the first time he was in danger. He readied himself for combat. Sword positioned in a high guard, to shield him from the blows of the enormous foes. He prepared himself mentally - should they attack, he planned to immediately riposte after clashing with their weapons. Should they approach, he planned to respond with a hammer blow followed by an upwards thrust directed at the first daredevil. Being outnumbered, he had to fight offensively, give his enemies no quarter and dictate the flow of the fight, otherwise they could strike all at once, or one after the other, giving them a tremendous advantage. However, it was crucial not to engage yet, because there was still was a chance for a different outcome. Fighting them would be Voidclaim's last resort, and an extremely dangerous endeavour, which could end tragically. He opened his mouth to speak.

Gazing up the sheer size of the tower might be more apparent... It was easily fifty paces wide... and Sally would not be able see the top , it simply rose higher than the looming cloud cover... At the end of her trail she'd find the base of the black tower... A chill raced over her as the torches surrounding the base of the spire burst into life... An entrance that might once have held a door waited before her.

Now how do ya open this thing...Hmmmmmm, maybe if I just tap it or something.\"Sally sheaths her crossbows and walks up to the door and places the palm of her hand on it slowly. \"Cmon door. Show up or something. The only other option is me using explosive magic to crack you open like an egg.

I think I'm seeing things D'arvit.\"\u00a0She picks herself up and looks around, \"What the heck? This is like that door isn't it...Oh well.
