The Guildhouse is built in the rocky hills of the northern forested region of Aozora that was once home to treacherous bandits. With the battle of Taloum won, the bandits were flushed out of the area. The Guildmaster was an accomplished warrior who's fought in multiple battles and retired to found the guild with Aozora's leader being one of the patrons for it.A twisted glittering tree with glowing indigo leaves.decorates the exclusive patio of the Guildhouse accompanied by benches, a fountain, and some bushes that will one day grow to become impressive hedges. The magic tree is prized by the Guildmaster who acquired the sapling as a gift from an old lover. Only honored guests and guild members can enjoy the relaxing patio.\u00a0________________________________________________Joining the Guild________________________________________________To join the Guild of Heroes you need to have proven yourself with heroic deeds, young unproven adventures will be offered quests to earn their merit to enter the heroes' hall.
