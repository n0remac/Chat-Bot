It is said that this ancient city was created on the back of a massive stone dragon. Legend has it that the dragon will rise again when the time is right. Some believe that this will occur when the world ends. Others say that only the mage who solidified the great beast can resurrect\u00a0it. The city has long been abandoned and such legends fade as quickly as sand dunes shift.
