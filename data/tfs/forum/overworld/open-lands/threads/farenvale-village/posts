A small mine near the village produces semi-precious stones of excellent quality which the village uses in trade with other settlements, the closest of which is two days away on foot. A few years ago, Farenvale suddenly shut itself off from the world, and the rumor was that it had been beset by bandits.The truth was that it had been taken over by a necromancer who turned the villagers into her thralls. The necromancer was driven off and the village restored and resettled by Emahra Untyrid. Under her patronage and leadership, the village has begun to thrive once more, as many people have come to settle and open their businesses there. Residents include, but are not limited to: Lord Tristian Seryl and Takhana Veil, associates of Emahra who aid her in the governance of the village, serving as a sort of triumvirate; Eleniel Windsong, owner of Windsong Bakery; Feru din Narith, mercenary and owner of Catcall Tavern; Liv Featherstone, owner of Featherstone Artificing; Sayuri Kurokawa, owner of Waterlily Tea House; Alystin Dalael, owner of Dalael Apothecary; Eloria Tyrins, local quirky mage and peddler of magical items; Ranith & Ryzith Fletcher, half-dragon twins who serve as couriers for the village's residents; Ryselle Fletcher, intermittent resident and animal care expert; Ifanna the Mender, who offers her services as healer; and Ravanys Tranir, who serves as the Captain of the village's small guard force.", "link_list": ["/user/1222", "/user/1067", "/user/1083", "/user/1084", "/user/1548", "/user/1677", "/user/1144", "/user/1158", "/user/1258", "/user/1038", "/user/1950", "/user/1060"], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/KSuwu3j.png"], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/KSuwu3j.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/></div>"}, "post-96655": {"user": "Emahra Untyrid", "user_num": 1453, "timestamp": "1593394968000", "message": "It had taken two days of walking, and camping at night, to reach the village.
