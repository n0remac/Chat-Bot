Plenty of time yeah, but he needed to stay concentrated if this was going to go his way. Vith observed the next throw by Davil and surely it he looked quite proficient as he threw the stone and it landed almost dead center and could almost not have been placed any better unless he were to do it by hand. Vithkun narrowed his eyes as it was his turn and thought he saw that smug smiling Davil dwarf giving him a challenging stare. Perhaps it was the wine but never the less Vithkun felt up to the task although his next throw would have to be quite something.Vithkun again blessed his stone with a few lucky words and fastened his gaze on Davil's stone - the stone he wanted so badly to knock away. Vithkun took aim and threw the stone up - higher than before to gain the most momentum possible - and hoped it would be enough to knock Davil's stone away should it hit. However at that height luck was more prevalent than skill and he looked at the downfall which made a hard clonking sound as the stone would smash against the first stone he had thrown and scoot right of the game area. But the stone he had hit fared even worse having been hit at such a velocity and at such an angle that it took flight and was sent flying like a projectile through the air right at Davil at a speed which even the fastest dwarf or elf could hardly react to.

His healing of Davil was unusual magic, not seen within these halls for many years and not commonly a gift given to the dwarves themselves.

His drunken state had also been removed. A clearer head prevailed because of Myra speaking in dwarvish translating and explaining to the other dwarves but leaving out the part about humiliation. Never would Vithkun know what she had and had not included but making him appear weak or apologetic was not within her to do. The odd sort of friendship between them extended to protecting him even when he was not aware of it, perhaps it was for the best. Davil hesitated but took Vithkun's hand his smaller one forming around the edge of it just as Myra's had a short bit ago. A gesture of good faith as he came to his feet he would say shortly, \"Things happen.\" He brushed off the back of his pants searching for the Drow woman before returning to Vith while never moving and saying with more good humor, \"Your aim and luck may be far off from true.\" Davil did not allow Myra to translate taking the time to do so himself to the others who laughed and then returned to the task at hand, which was drinking and starting another game seeing as those two were far enough from the playing field. \"Why don't we share a drink then,\" Myra would clasp a hand on Davil's shoulder including Vith in the invitation.

There was no ill intent but with what had happened lately there was no way he could claim to have bad luck - this was just pure lack of skills and then the outcome could vary greatly. Vithkun wasn't slow to agree with Myra's request for a drink though and perhaps Davil was not the rude dwarf he Vithkun thought him to be but only time would tell here.

He wondered if that was what was needed, but he didn't want to turn it down now that Myra had recommended it. Vithkun glanced back at Myra. \"So you think I'll need my strength to drink this?

First he took it easy chugging the beer in a way that he could abandon the task at any point but as he felt it was indeed possible without making a 'Davil' he raised it horizontally and downed the contents in quick succession before eventually turning it completely bottoms up until it was all gone.

It would blow around them and yet not reach them for the solid bottom of the elevator like contraption. Reglin released the lock upon the door shoving it upward with one hand as it clanged into place. It found purchase at the top and remained there the solid metal only connecting with the magnets meant to keep it if it was pushed far enough upward. Reglin stepped out into an unlit area. There was enough from the rope lighting to see the main entrance and to tell there were two doors of solid stone open and beyond it was nothing but darkness, \u201cIt will take a moment for your eyes to adjust but we will not need further light,\u201d he would inform him as he walked through with no sense of worry. As soon as the light faded from behind them he paused and looked upward. Above them was a glittering stone embedded into the rock itself. If his ceiling was meant to resemble the night sky this showed not the constellations but the universes themselves in a clear stone that reflected as it if were entranced by moonlight. It flowed down upon them making their skin almost translucent and their eyes still dark no reflection lingering there from the light. Reglin\u2019s were like deep pools as if it could not pierce it and if Vith had a mirror he would notice the same of himself.\u201cThese were not placed by my people,\u201d He told the prince,\u201d Nor are they ever to be removed by anyone who passes here.\u201d They descended farther into the earth following the trail above them until they came to a cavern. How exspansive it was was beyond description and words that would fail even the most talented of bards to sing of this tale. It went far beyond the naked eye. Vithkun might have felt it before, the thrum of the very earth as they descended, the slight shaking of an earthquake beneath his feet, but here as he followed the King down a narrow path in the center he would feel as if the very earth beneath him shifted. The King then lit a light, a single candle, as they walked forward water surrounding them on both sides. Deep pools that he got the feeling if he stepped in them he might not ever be able to once again rise to the surface. They walked for a few hundred feet until they came to a circular section, its edges descended into the water with no clear end to them but it was noticeable that it was rounded perfectly with the center being higher in elevation. \u201cStand here,\u201d Reglin would ask moving Vithkun to the very center. When he had done so he stepped back and then he blew out the candle that he carried to that point. The earth was alive then, the stones above them once again providing all light but they did not remain in place. It was as if they were in the belly of a beast and it breathed and they moved shifting to and fro and rolling backwards and forwards. The water reflected it in ripples no calm allowed here as it rolled away from the center where he stood and outwards throughout the expanse. There was a hum here, drawn from the bottom of a throat and so deep and faint that it was almost nonexistent. Reglin had moved to his knees and his hands touched the ground where the vibrations ran throughout his entire body almost numbing him with the sensation and he motioned for Vith to do the same. To feel the very Earth as it sang its song through him, as it gifted him with the represenstation of the life of where they stood.

Before long they had arrived and it was probably the deepest Vithkun had even traveled downwards and - to be honest - he had probably never left the surface in a longer distance in any direction than this. The tunnel was dark and as Vithkun stepped out into it the sensation suddenly stunned him. He had expected this place to be more lifeless than a tomb but instead he felt a vibrancy from the earth itself and what could only be described as a powerful life force - one he had never before experienced to such an extend. \"Marvellous...\" Vithkun sighed thinking if this was the thrum that Reglin had spoken of? Would it be even more intense, his sharpened elven sensations may take in more than they could handle. Vithkun looked up on the odd blueish stone and felt even more marvel as words failed to come out of his mouth before Reglin had motioned on, Vithkun followed along. The path narrowed and the faint light from the candle wasn't much to go by, but his natural agility helped him not stray from solid ground. The water beneath, while not feeling vile or evil, felt old as creation itself and would not take kindly to any life that dropped into it supporting them with no buoyancy - of that he was sure. But as he stepped into the gigantic cavern the pure vastness met him with sigh of epic proportions and he motioned to a stand still for a short moment before pressing on as not to slip too far behind his guide. Having crossed the pools of water they reached what seemed to be their destination and on the plateau he was told to stand at the center of the circular formation and Vithkun felt as if this life he had experienced earlier was now all around him - if not actually flowing in and out of him. As if he was being breathed through by an ancient entity and even though he would be standing on solid rock it was as if he was suspended in water as the crests and troughs motioned effortlessly with no particular interest in Vithkun being there. As Reglin blew out the candle it got dark and even though the sensation was intense to say the least he was carefully adjusting himself to it - as was the elves' inert ability to attune themselves to beasts and nature alike, although the pure brutishness of this kind of life force was a little more tricky but he was determined to overcome it nonetheless. Vithkun motioned himself to his knees as Reglin did as the hue lit them both up in the vast dark void of the unfathomable vast cave. The reverberations suddenly got a lot more distinct and while sitting there Vithkun felt connected - not to the ground only - but to something he knew beyond any doubt was a living entity. The deep hum and thrum was indistinguishable to that of breathing - only what breathed like this was no mere beast. It was ancient no doubt and so powerful that the pulses of reverberations being send through his palms almost glued him to the ground as his body matched the almost electric breathing in the ground and all around him to such an extend that he felt life flow through him. However his very breath had been stifled too and in an almost desperate attempt to break free from the connection he mustered all his will at the same time to finally relieve his hands from the ground breaking the nearly magnetic connection again panting and snapping for air.

The troll as well could have made it during the summer months and been biding its time.Myra had been consumed with her thoughts at first.

So Myra wasn't being deceived by the underworld type in the slightest and with Vithkun's apt sense of hearing he noticed the essence of what Myra told him his smile widening.

Tells and signs that people carried with dishonesty and a questionable nature of these very men had made her draw conclusions almost instantly that she did not want to become involved. There too was too much warning that this encounter would end in violence. Prepared for the very sort she had already drawn the long handed Morningstar by the time he called for aid.The man she had forced to the ground a moment ago was backing up rather quickly. If he thought to escape he was wrong for she would hunt him down like a rabid dog. Right this second she had a bit more pressing issues.  Her aim with the spear had been true due to luck but her aim with her own weapon was true due to practice. Extensively experienced in swinging it as if it were an extension of herself she never learned swordplay or how to fire a bow but smashing something to absolute smithereens was well within her wheelhouse. Bringing it about face to the man swinging his sword he had made the mistake of coming to close. The handle on the morning star was approximately three feet in length including the head of the weapon. Holding it at the very end of the handle gave her less leverage but her strength as Drow made up for much of the inconvenience of weilding the weapon in such a manner and considering she normally swung it like a batter at baseball with the heavier end at the tip she could count not only on the sheer force of her swing but also on the weight of it assisting her when it did make contact. Bringing it about face to the edge of her hip she had it held directly so it was level with the ground and facing completely forward. Then like a golfer following through on his swing she brought it upward and almost over, but she tilted it like a bat at the last second going from an upward swing to a sideways one but it was not completely horizontal with her body but at a 45 degree angle. With such she was aiming for his extended arms both spread slightly apart meaning even if she caught it in the middle that it would make contact with one and possibly the second should they have been at different levels as he swung down. She gave no leave to pulling punches with her hit following through because if she did not the sword might have continued its path. She was matching force for force attempting to make him waver. Her only hope was by hitting his arms that the weight of the sword and the extension of it would cause his very hands to cave to the pressure releasing it and sending him reeling. It was a wide hit to swing about her entire right arm had extended and should she miss, she was already in the process of turning her whole body twisting and placing weight into the hit by drawing her right foot backwards turning like a ballerina and pivoting on the one foot.
