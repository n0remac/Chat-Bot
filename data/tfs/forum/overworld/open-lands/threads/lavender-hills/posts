Nothing wrong with a little caution... Like a spider, he crept low so that just the top of his head, and eyes stuck above the ever-swaying flowers. He caught his breath seeing the--- Woman?

The breeze carried with it the scent of distant flowers, and the quiet man lifted his face to it, breathing deeply.  For the past several days, the man had been traveling across the nigh-endless plains, enjoying the serene atmosphere lent by the gently swaying grasses and peaceful wildlife, here in one of the most settled corners of the realm that he'd ventured through thus far.  The utter tranquility reminded Falcon greatly of the untouched, gentle idylls of home, and for a long moment, he paused at the crest of a hill, gazing down into the valley below.\"...As good a place to make camp as any...\" he murmured to himself, absentmindedly brushing his hair back into place as the longer locks poised carefully in an artful wave above his brow.  In a few silent, dedicated minutes, Falcon had erected a rough wayfarer's camp, complete with a tent, fire pit, and setup of cooking supplies handy.  He went about chopping vegetables, cutting up meat, and throwing in seasoning to create a rough, homespun stew that carried a surprising amount of flavor (at least, according to the man himself).  He dumped it into the cooking pot, lit a small fire, and retired to sit on a nearby rock for a few moments.\"...Vanorius...good Centurion, what do I do without you...\"  Falcon murmured, voice thick with emotion.  He ground his fingers into the rock, tensing for a moment, before letting loose an explosive breath.\"No.  Too much to do.  I...I should train,\" he mouthed breathlessly, rising in one fluid motion and discarding his shirt effortlessly.  Shirtless and in only loose, comfortable pants, Falcon began to move through a series of exercises to clear his mind.  As the dance took hold, the man's troubled expression began to fade, replaced with one of contentment.  Stretches, then strength training, then strikes, then the battle...movement after movement blended together.  At one point he'd acquired his sword, beginning to flow through one form after another, seeking to forestall the inevitable night alone.

As the dance continued, magic began to swell in his veins, roaring through his bloodstream and highlighting his presence to anyone with the ability to sense such arcana for miles around.

He'd done this to himself, he knew - invoked his enchantment, called his power, and it answered. Hungrily. Growling, Falcon launched himself into a series of strikes and blocks punctuated with short, controlled bursts of arcana - raw, magical energy that would harm anyone not attuned to the caster's energy. Efficient, effective, and utterly trivial to channel through his magically-attuned body, Falcon smiled as he watched the beauty - the weave of the threads, blue and silver, arcana twisting into shapes that would defy all earthly attempt to grasp the true nature of magic. Breathtaking...and terrifying.Show them the might of Avalon's Imperator.--Although Falcon did not notice the flitting of what could be a large bird - the man was not known for his awareness, to any extent - he certainly noticed the arrival of a panting young woman, panicked and shivering. His magical sense rolled over her, giving him details which he would sort through later, when he had overcome his initial surprise.  For a heartbeat, the two stared at each other - Falcon's dark brown eyes gazing unblinkingly into the woman's exotic irises.  Before he could utter a word, she cried out.\"Help!\"Falcon reacted adequately to what happened next; the slavering beast crested the hill, attention still fixed on its prey - the young woman who'd stumbled to the ground in front of his small camp site.\u00a0 Having had little time to think of a strategy, and even less to digest what was really going on, he did the only thing he could possibly think of in the situation.He clawed at his naked chest, ripping the emblem hanging from his neck from its chain - a stylized, golden falcon, wings spread in mid-flight - and hurled the icon at the monstrosity with considerable force.\u00a0 Although such a small projectile would normally mean nothing to a focused hunter, as luck would have it, the missile struck the brute straight in one of its four small eyes, set in pairs over its long, drooling beak.\u00a0 The brute roared in outrage, angered more than threatened, and reoriented its full attention onto him.Perfect.Falcon defiantly took two steps forward, leveling his blade in a cross-wise guard over his body - and also positioning himself in front of the woman, who even now tried to scramble back to her feet.The initial, stinging insult, combined with the fact that this gangly being was now attempting to deny the creature its long-sought prey, was too much for the monstrosity.\u00a0 It gave an unearthly shriek, full of fury and promising violence, and charged straight at Falcon.\u00a0 For his part, the man looked back towards the woman now shivering behind him, and spoke in a well-modulated, cultured tone.\"So.\u00a0 You do this often?\"\u00a0\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Falcon's training continued unabated.
