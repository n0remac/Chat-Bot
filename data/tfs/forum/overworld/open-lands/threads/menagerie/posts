In it is where its now sole keeper lives.surrounding the tower are various huts and feeding areas for the animals, along with pens for the ones less suited to the open fields.the field itself is dotted with trees, boulders, small hills and even a small lake, fed by a stream coming from off in the surrounding forests.Underground is where the winter provisions are kept, amongst other things.Finally there is the gate, a set of two metal doorways with wooden doors, to prevent creatures from escaping as soon as the gates are open. Visitors and deliveries come through these gates.Visitors are welcome to come and see the array of antelope, deer, wild horses, goats, tapirs, and many more animals, along with bringing in their own specimens for safe and happy keeping, or some of the best veterinary care in the area.Welcome to the menagerie!", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The Menagerie is what many would call a zoo, a wide open and sunny field, where its many wild inhabitants can roam free without free of predation , starvation, or habitat loss."}, "post-79812": {"user": "Zookeeper", "user_num": 2878, "timestamp": "1519002528000", "message": "The large keeper was tired from loading the cargo buggy.

Dont worry i already packed up all your stuff, and with how long it takes to open the gates we'd better head off now\"She kneels just enough for the keeper to clumsily climb on, and takes him over to the cart.\u00a0 \u00a0 \"good girl\" He says, giving her a soft pat.\u00a0He checked the 4 beasts hitched up, petted them a bit, and got to work opening the massive gate system, pulling on various chains and locks to slowly open one gate, get the cart through, close it, and do the same with the next.eventually the front gate closed with its echoing slam, and the cart headed off down the unkempt road with the constant drumming of hooves.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The large keeper was tired from loading the cargo buggy.
