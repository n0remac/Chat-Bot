Commonly banked with fog that rolls off the Silverfire Sea, most of the islands are large enough to have at least one village each, and given the amount of fighting that happens on each of them, they are all surrounded by thick, wooden palisades. The \"fighting\" has never been quiet enough to allow for stone building, given the islands are constantly under Zephyr, Rondon, or foreign threat.It is hard to keep these islands, but they are fertile, and they are key to the Ryel. Currents are strong on the outer two islands, but on low tide, sand bars often connected the inner islands in some places where the water recedes to only knee-deep. Other places, however, have a steep drop, and the locals of the islands are aware of a network of \"underwater\" caves that are accessible only during low tide.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.pinimg.com/564x/e6/71/79/e671795daa6192ff3a277201dd53fe49.jpg"], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.pinimg.com/564x/e6/71/79/e671795daa6192ff3a277201dd53fe49.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/></div>"}, "post-78812": {"user": "The Kingdom of Rond\u00f3n", "user_num": 2185, "timestamp": "1516854794000", "message": "[[  ]]They did not see the Islands when they first approached.

Like ghosts they whispered over the shore, their own sounds muted by a spell spoken between the mages, who raised shields to 'hide' their presence from the Zephyy.Indeed, they remained quiet and calm... as if their prows had never broken a ripple through the water. The men slowly advanced until their leaders told them to halt... and through the mist, they saw the Zephyy warriors break through... looking for them.The Rondi men stayed quiet, as a message was passed to the men still at the ships with their trebuchet and ranged weapons there. In the distance, back on the ships, something was lit on fire, gaining in the interest of Zephyy---- until suddenly the mists were lifted, and the Rondi men roared forward on foot, clashing with the line of Zephyy men and giving the signal to the men back at the ships to come down with their cavalry, and to send flaming balls of fire into the air and into the light wooded forest where the Zephyy men had clearly been hiding.With the clash of Rondi with Zephyy, the fog was broken and dissipated like smoke. It revealed Zephyy ships rounding the edges of this first large island, coming for the Rondi ships, not all of which had grounded themselves.

As the Rond\u00ed flagship sailed up besides The Sea Serpent, Windfeld told him to take his men and claim or sink the boats in front of them. The men had most likely either jumped ship while the rest had taken cover inside the cabins of the ships. Either way there were probably no one to steer the ships right now and they would be prime targets for the Rond\u00ed fleet. \"Wait for me when you're done and we'll meet up on the other side of this island to pick up any who wants go to the next couple of islands.\" Windfeld said. He had been pondering when his chance would be and it seemed like it was now. Along with his undead Zephyy ship that now sailed under Rond\u00ed banner as his own currently did, he sailed closer to the cliffs looking for the fabled network of caves, where a huge treasure might be hiding. If finding any caves Windfeld would lower the row boats and venture inside long with a good fifteen men.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Windfeld took a sip of a bottle of black rum humming a dark tune as he wiped his mouth and listened to the commotion on the other ship.

As Rafael got off his horse Suezo bowed deeply but did catch a glimpse of that blue magic in his eyes. Was that what caused those arcs of lightning before? A few years ago Suezo had been among those who were tasked to find and rid Jeoncho of magic users by the order of the former shogun, so he knew magic and how dangerous it could be. But he had never held any personal grudges against those who wielded it, he had just carried out the orders from his lord. \"I'm sorry young lord Rafael, we were sent here with only enough horses to carry our stuff. I think we have no more than ten horses at our disposal here, and they are not trained in war.\" he said keeping his head bowed for a little longer before raising it again. \"I'm sorry if we don't match your expectations, we shall try to fight with even more honor in our hearts for Rond\u00f3n and her people from now on!\" Suezo promised, figuring Rafael was displeased with their suitability for this war. \"We will follow you to the end. Please take us with you!\" Suezo promised as he got all the way down to his knees so his head could touch the ground in a bow - the deepest sign of commitment and how of honor to a lord a samurai could offer. Quickly after the rest of Suezo's nearly two hundred samurai would do the same.

Windfeld 'Sea-shrieker'They were terrifying on the seas, the stuff of nightmares, stories that were already sweeping from Zephyy ship to Zephyy ship and across into the land.

The tide was too high, and although a boat could sail in there, every single man within it would need to be belly down within it, and there was no telling that the boat would actually manage to get any deeper or be ruined itself.He'd have to wait for another time,and sail his ship to the otherside of the island where......................... Suezo OguroRafael was thrown off by Suezo's seeming NEED to honor and be considered honorable by the young prince. The young man blinked, the bright blue from his eyes fading until they were their natural sapphire, and he reached out to put a hand on Suezo's shoulder. \"You've fought well. Valiantly. I can't finish this war without you,\" Rafael told Suezo, trying to look him in the eye as he did so. He turned and spoke in quick Rondi to his other men. They nodded and followed his orders, and Rafael turned back to Suezo. \"You and your men will be given Rondi warhorses. WE need to keep men behind to watch the island and defend it. The rest us move on across, where Admiral Windfeld will be waiting to take us to the next island. This victory alone was small -- the people of this island are loyal to Rondon. The next two that we go to will be full of Zephyy traitors, and there, your swiftness will be needed.\"Rafael turned and mounted his own horses, and the two hundred Rondi men who were going to stay behind gave up their horses to the Tawakoshi samurai. A few long minutes of orders and communication went around between them all. Four Rondi ships were going to stay near the bay, while the rest took off with other men to follow after Windfeld's ships.Meanwhile, the Rondi men went to the bay to wait for Windfeld -- to be ferried across to the next island...", "link_list": ["/user/2628", "/user/2799"], "image_list": [], "html": "..............................

To the Rond\u00ed these ships were probably the most expensive pieces of war spoil they could get their hands on and would be properly happy to seize them. But to Windfeld they were toys. You could steer a ship like you could steer any dead body - and dispose of it when it was no longer in a condition to your liking. So it happened that Windfeld and the Rond\u00ed and Zephyy ships - one with a charming undead crew on board - docked on the other side of the now Rond\u00ed controlled part of Las Islas. \"Well hello..! Who have we got here? Rafael my favorite sparring partner!\" Windfeld said as he approached Rafael with no small amount of pirate friendliness. \"We have caught a few Zephyy ships as you see - unspoiled. At least the ships themselves.\" he said with a murderous grin. His face turned more serious quickly though.\"Listen... Attacking head on would be the stupid solution with the advantage we carry here. There are four Zephyy ships and I could cloak their presence with mist like the Zephyy do, so they only see them shortly before they dock the harbor on the other side. Inside the ships you and whatever accomplished men you have in your mind would set foot on their land and and surprise them. Out from the fog only a little later me and the Rond\u00ed ships will appear to back you up. How does that sound huh?\" he said and lit his pipe puffing a bit on it. For some reason Windfeld seemed to enjoy the company of Rafael quite a bit and didn't seem to be discouraged by the the fact that the notion wasn't entirely shared by Rafael. \"Ohh... One of the Zephyy ship is already full. We should have them dock first, after all they still carry their Zephyy clothes as a mark to their former lords.\" he said and gave a ruffled chuckle.
