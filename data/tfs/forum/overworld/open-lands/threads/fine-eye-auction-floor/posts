Held daily, the auctioneers will roll out an ever-changing collection of artifacts, rare materials, and even people to be bid on! Those participating can be found mostly on the ground floor, but the few who hold higher levels of membership can be seen in the balcony that encircles the room. Carved by artisans, the auction floor displays a fine skill in carpentry. A polished stage sits at one end with an audience of chairs before it, surrounded by a dozen wooden beams. They support the slatted balcony looming down onto the stage, bolstering the status of those who occupy it. The balustrade is unique, displaying slaves, weapons, and precious commodities. Along the ceiling hangs several chandeliers made of iron, their candles cased in glass to cover the room in prismed light.Given the hazardous nature of some of the items being sold, there are a number of magical wards in place to keep anything from going awry. For certain items even these wards are not enough for, it will be announced the item on stage is a replica and that genuine article is being held in the auctions vault. The winner can then simply collect it at their own risk.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/eiYdqx0.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\" \" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/eiYdqx0.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/>"}, "post-94029": {"user": "Maribel Correa", "user_num": 3269, "timestamp": "1575601336000", "message": "A smile graced a pair of dark lips.Never before had she seen the auction from the balcony.
