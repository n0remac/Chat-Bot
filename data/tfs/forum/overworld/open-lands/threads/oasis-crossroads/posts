It was being raided by a band of greenskins and whatever nasties they brought along with them. Nuns, monks and little choir boys they carried off. But unluckily for them a messenger was sent to ask if it had a translation of some long lost text. They didn't, but more importantly the messenger went back and relayed the news to another Church which relayed it to another, so on and so forth. Seeing an opportunity to be rid of quite a big threat in the area some high-up lad decided to send a whole expeditionary force. So they went to the Parish and found only a few of the inhabitants in it before were left alive. Angry, the force sent some scouts to find the foe and so they did. Right at night, the whole force crept up and then charged. As you can imagine, not a very many of the enemy got away, the young, the lassies, those who already happened to be mounted, the really fast ones. So after burning the camp and stomping it into the ground, the Chaplain of the force said the unrighteous filth had to be stomped out to the last, and we followed. They went to a forest, called Elwythe by some folk. We went in it long, and then someone smelled something nasty. We realized it was the rotting corpses of the enemies, torn apart with bits on trees and... anyway, dead. So then we thought about what had killed them and we quite soon realized we made a mistake following them. Should have left them alone, and the blood thirsty Chaplain got more than half the expedition dead. The forest came alive, trees uprooted and marched, swarms of bugs, snakes, owls, wolves and whatever the hell else lives in forests charged. And finally, right from our flank the dead came alive; at least those of them still mostly in one piece, but this included those of us who died too. We burned it down, and put up a sign to make sure nobody follows suit. Of a whole two thousand about five hundred -give or take for wounded who soon died after and for the frightened deserters - survived.\" With that, he drank considerably more ale only putting down the mug after it was nearly finished. \"I think I know why I don't want to sleep.\" he said, but soon followed up with \"Well I'll get over it.

The shield proved to be a kite shield, running from his shoulder to mid way down his thigh, while the sword summoned as an arming sword. He gave the sword a quick swing, and nearly fell off balance, not used to having no weight pulling him forward that he would instinctively\u00a0fight back. <i>That's going to take some getting used to</i>.<br/><br/>With another command, the two disappeared back into the rings. He was nearly set for the mission, but he still needed a helmet. Searching the pieces of armor for something that would fit, he finally alighted upon a burgonet helm with a visor with little holes drilled into them for breathing. Testing it upon his head, it was heavier than he was used to wearing with his sallet helm, but it would do for now. Taking it off, he turned to the rest of the party, waiting for them to finish their preparations.\u00a0</br></font>"}, "post-81627": {"user": "Regal Al'nin Withernorth", "user_num": 236, "timestamp": "1523749007000", "message": "Regal had been gathering his belongings, changing back into his traveling clothes.
