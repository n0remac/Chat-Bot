It was hard to keep the various contigents of the rebel forces in line, and in their eagerness to do battle they charged the lines of the Saracid army.  Araces managed to hold the center against Daamus\u2019 elite guard, while Alexios and other allies pressed the flanks.

His loyal subjects were disheartened, and those who did not flee immediately were butchered by Daamus\u2019 elite forces.  Although the allies may have been able to reform and defeat what remained of the Saracid army, there was to much confusion and doubt within their ranks to maintain any type of cohesion.  Various generals tried to rally what men they could, but they were cut down without support from the scattered allies.  What was suppose to be a sure victory ended in a disastrous defeat.Alexios had no choice but to flee northwards, towards N\u2019ron.  The hilly landscape and mountainous terrain might conceal him and his Leopard cavalry for a time, at least until other potential allies regrouped with him.  The Leopards, as they were called, numbered about one-hundred fifty, and were fortunate to have lost only a few men in the battle.  They provided Araces\u2019 rebel army with an elite unit of shock cavalry, who could deliver a terrifying charge and break the ranks of the enemy.The mercenaries actually hailed from a city-state many miles away and across the sea.
