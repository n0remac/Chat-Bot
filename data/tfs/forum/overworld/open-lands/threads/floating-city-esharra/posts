After a few days he would be near the base and able to get a good look at what exactly was going on.As the storm cloud became cleared he began to notice what seemed like structures protruding from it. What could possibly be built here in this mountain range he had no clue, he was not native to these parts and knew little of his surroundings besides his relative location on the map. Once he eclipsed the last foothill and the mountain was in full view he was astonished at it's beauty, it was as if he had stumbled upon the land of the gods. Structures were built out of the clouds and ascended last the very peak of the mountain, magic was in the air and a faint burning smell came to his nostrils.

He approached the main gate and took note of the guards, the place seemed friendly enough and the guards looked like they had never seen real combat before but had trained every day for it.

A gate in the wall, wide enough to let through five men standing breadth-to-breadth and only a little taller than a room was protected by a tower and a portcullis of shining steel. Captain Mordane would notice that the natural path of the valley walls slowly turned inwards towards this end, leaving any attacking force without the ability to flank or otherwise get around the fortifications. Their only option would be to fight, or turn and leave... Yet on that day, the captain would find the gate as open as the portcullis and a finely-paved road of white stone led through a small military outpost and towards a second gate; this one seeming to be a shimmering veil like a mirror made of water, but showing onlookers a strange city square rather than their own reflection. When he reached the outer gates and gave them his information, the gate guards (wearing finer, if not similar armour to the archers and wielding long spears and shields) gestured in perfect unison with their inner arms; 'proceed through the gate' it clearly meant, despite not a single word being spoken.Behind the walls, Mordane would find the guard had easily tripled. They stood in pairs outside every building, at every three paces along the road and a group of twenty stood guard by the second gate; ten on each side. There were civilians too, some outsiders who had set up shop in a small, open market area and a few of the local Esharran had presumably come down from the city above to barter.The Esharran looked magnificent. One could easily tell them apart from the outsiders, for these dwellers and natives of a city that sat above a mountain had no blemishes, dirt or signs of illness. They were fair in their complexion, of hair and each of them seeming uniquely sculpted yet and no less beautiful than the rest. Their skin was like gold to a distant eye and even those with darker skin were a rich caramel! And speak no less of their attire, for each of them wore white, gold or silver clothes as fine as any human aristocrat's, though human they clearly weren't. In fact there was a slight (if only minutely so) strangeness to how they all looked so close to perfect, how so many of them shared bone structure, eye-shape or body-type...Some of the civilian Esharran looked upon Mordane as though he was a curious man, a novelty that they could admire but would rather not approach. Even those who spoke with politeness and grace to the bartering merchants had this same look about them, though the soldiers seemed far too disciplined to share this curiosity.", "link_list": ["/user/2389"], "image_list": [], "html": "<span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-2389 group-0\" href=\"/user/2389\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@merc\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Mordane</span></a></span>"}, "post-69771": {"user": "Madelena Winterscar", "user_num": 1492, "timestamp": "1498056312000", "message": "Her travels had been long and tough.

One half of the scale featured a human skull, with the second holding a strange book. The square itself was rather large, but the only way to leave it other than the portal he came through were a series of bridges that led to the large, impossibly complex canton superstructures that made up the vast majority of Esharra.

Though he may have appeared to live on the outskirts of his society, he was much a part of and a believer in it than any of the aristocrats who lived lives of luxuries in the highest floors of their great cantons.\"However about a year ago, a strange and sudden change was brought upon us. Our ruler decided that, for the first time in at least a thousand years, we should open our gates to outsiders and contact the outside world...

He considered the citizens and realised that the city was unlike any other he had visited. Most cities would have plazas and markets, but these were raucous places populated by the great unwashed of society scheming for ways to find their next meal or ale, the air would be awash with noise and odour that would assault the senses, but this place was different. No beggars sat at the foot of the statue, no blind or disfigured sought benevolence, there were no urchins preying on distracted merchants, the whole place was calmer and more affluent than anything he thought even possible. This place was not natural, and he feared that behind the visible wealth of this city there must be a dark secret powering the economy. As he wandered the square considering the crowd, he noticed a rogueish Esharran striding purposefully toward the portal Santiago had entered through. The Esharran wore a blade at his waist, setting him apart from the other citizenry he had seen thus far. He suspected the Esharran would be the most likely person he had seen so far to have contacts who may be able to assist him, and he was keen to try and weave his way into a meeting with him, so he quickly followed him back through the portal and out of the city proper and back toward the military base at the base of the mountain.As he was close to catching up to him, the Esharran rogue began speaking to a female, obviously a visitor to the city, who he didn't appear to have met before.  Santiago hung back as they discussed something out of earshot, and as they moved away a short time later, he followed them to a nearby stable.As he got close enough he was able to hear the Esharran telling the scholarly female about local laws, comments that confirmed his previous thoughts, and go on to advise her on avoiding the aristocracy. As she stabled her horse and then made their plans, he deemed he would follow them and attempt to find a way to introduce himself to the pair. He would certainly feel less exposed as part of a larger group, and hoped that the local Esharran would prove a valuable asset in cracking the riddle of the city, and would be the first step in revealing exactly where his powerful quarry was hiding.

Though he was not yet sure what to think about the scholar, he had recognised the zeal in her words and her heart. She seemed to want to not only learn, but help whoever she could with her education out of some sort of genuine virtue that most didn't have. Those were qualities that should be supported and encouraged, qualities that may even be needed in Esharra even if he couldn't quite see it the way she could.As the girl made ready to get Madelena her room, Iksuda approached Santiago Sleeke and Mordane and sat himself down with a nod. \"Our associate will be here soon, I should think. Then after a briefing we can begin.\"-About an hour passed, during which Iksuda had a drink that he barely touched and a sandwich filled with salad native to that part of the world. Food and refreshments would be served to Santiago, Mordane and Madelena too if they wished it, but Iksuda didn't speak much due to the myriad of thoughts running through his head. Eventually a man entered in rather smart dress, who Mordane might recognise as one of the two men he had approached from the evening prior; not Mr. Sun, so this one must be Mr. Moon. With silent steps Mr. Moon walked across to the three men, who glanced at Santiago strangely and then over to Iksuda. Iksuda gave an assuring nod, then Mr. Moon gestured for them to follow. \"Let's go,\" he explained, as he made his way behind the bar and opened the hatch to the cellar. Down the steps he went, with Iksuda following closely holding the back of 'acquired' supplies. Down below, casks of ale and drink were lining the rather cool and spacious room, but in the centre stood a table and series of chairs around it that was clearly used for meetings.\"Take a seat,\" Mr. Moon told them. Iksuda did as told, then waited for the others to do the same. When all were settled, Mr. Moon withdrew a map from his robe detailed with all the intricate passageways of an area of Esharra, a canton that from the spacious rooms and marked spots of patrol guards could be deduced as being a rather well-off area in the higher city.\"Tonight,\" Mr. Moon began, \"you will infiltrate the home of Bishop Barsic and kidnap him.\"-Up above, the girl behind the bar would keep her eye on Madelena if she hadn't retired to her room. \"So you are from the lower world?\" She would ask rather inquisitively. \"What's it like?\"", "link_list": ["/user/1492", "/user/2393", "/user/2389"], "image_list": [], "html": "Iksuda smiled as he made his way to the bar, telling the shy girl behind it that a room for "}, "post-70624": {"user": "Madelena Winterscar", "user_num": 1492, "timestamp": "1500410184000", "message": "As they sat down in the tavern and the drinks had arrived, there would be no room for talk.

You will not be attending the ball of course, but the noise and the amount of people who are should provide satisfactory cover for what we need to do. The guard will likely be doubled as compared to normal, but there's always a way into these places that security overlooks or fails to properly guard and we have it on good authority that the Bishop has several planned meetings that will require the use of areas that are.. Off limits, so to speak.\"Mr. Moon explained their task clearly and with some authority. If Santiago Sleeke and Mordane had any doubts up to that point, it would quickly prove clear that he was the man in charge - or at least one of them. \"These areas should be lightly guarded, if at all. Most will be watching key entrances and exits, or attending security in the main areas of the house where rivalries, drunkards and those looking solely to fill their bed for the night will keep them quite preoccupied,\" he said. \"The plan is simple. Move quickly and quietly, stumble upon one of our beloved Bishop's meetings and use the sleeping powder to knock them all out. Use the rope to bind the bishop, then get out and bring him back here. If any of you are seen, you are simply party-goers who got a little lost in all the excitement; hence the masks.\"As Mr. Moon spoke, Iksuda spent the majority of it scanning over the map and carefully memorising routes and secret paths with a trace of his finger. In his own silence Iksuda was a little concerned by the suddenness of the entire thing, but he understood why it was happening. Spies in the organisation meant that anything that didn't happen spontaneously could well be leaked, while the use of outsiders hopefully assured some sort of temporary loyalty to their immediate contractors. \"Any questions?\" Mr. Moon finally asked.---\"Isra?\" The girl behind the bar asked inquisitively. \"Never heard of it.
