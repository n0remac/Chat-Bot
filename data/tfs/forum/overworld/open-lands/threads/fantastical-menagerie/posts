Sighing heavily, she stepped away from her counter and poked her head past the curtain into the depths of the tent.\"Father! We've got a pair of visitors.

He beamed at the pair through an unkempt, steely-grey beard adorned with assorted beads and braids. He wore a long brown overcoat, heavily stained and on fire on the left sleeve. Noticing the small blaze, he patted it out before turning back to his customers.\"Hello, visitors! Customers! Guests! Friends! Welcome to Darling's Menagerie. I'm Jonathan Darling, and I see you've already met Lynne. I take it you're interested in seeing my wondrous collection of exotic beasts that I've gathered throughout my travels? Well, if so...you're in for a treat! I have creatures that nobody here can even imagine, oddities from lands far and wide. Have you ever seen an Ukuluk, mighty steed of the Goborian Riders from the icy northern tundras of Ik'ali? Or a beautiful Floovi Bird, famed for its iridescent feathers and elaborate mating displays? Or maybe even a Mihiki, fabled by the Cthuli Tribes of the Yarmin Jungles for stealing babies and snatching women? I'll bet you haven't. Come inside, and prepare to be amazed!\"Indeed, none of the places or creatures he mentioned would sound even slightly familiar to either one of the newcomers, no matter how worldly or well-educated they happened to be. He stepped past his daughter and pulled the curtain aside with a dramatic sweep of his arm, revealing the inside of the tent. It was lit by thousands of flickering lights that buzzed and twirled up above in the canopy, and was filled with rows upon rows of cages, some as large as a cottage and others smaller than a tankard of ale. Each one contained one or more creatures, each more unique than the last. They bellowed and roared, stomped and squawked. Not a single one would be familiar to either Amaya or Qin, although Mr. Darling seemed to know each one personally. He stepped up to the first cage, about the size of a child's crib. Inside, an apple-sized orange blob sat in the center, glistening slimily in the firefly's light. Mr. Darling plucked a sliver of meat from a pouch on his belt, tossing it into the cage. The blob extended a squishy tendril towards the meat, which sizzled and dissolved upon contact. Moments later, the meat was gone, and the blob looked ever-so-slightly bigger.\"Marvelous, isn't it? It's like a jellyfish, but on land! I've decided to name it...a jellybeast. I cut this one off of a much larger one some years back, in a dark cave on the Island of Hemo. Interesting place, Hemo.

Still, it is quite a bit of work. I've got quite a collection of notes on all of these, so that I remember what to feed them and how to prevent them from eating me.
