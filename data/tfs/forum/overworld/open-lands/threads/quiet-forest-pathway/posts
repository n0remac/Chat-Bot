This new road cut through a forest that, as the peculiar locals seemed to indicate, led to a town within or on the other side.

The Varan warrior would have tried his hardest to convince his old friend to come along, for he enjoyed her company and desired her presence.Unfortunately, Ralf had only a few coins - not even enough to buy a mount.

He wondered which path would lead to a town, if at all.  Historically a group of folks might want to build along or at least near a source of water - so he was more inclined to follow the left path, which followed the stream.  At least they could refill their canteens if they went this way as well.  And if his hunting skills had taught him anything, many a critter's path would cross the stream to sip its contents - so if the two needed to hunt for food it would be easier along the creek no doubt.  Perhaps the decision would have much easier if Ralf could have only understood the mumbling fool's dialect.Collecting his thoughts the Varan turned to his friend and said \"I say we take the left path and follow this stream.
