The air was downright <i>frigid </i>now. Despite the thick robes, it seemed that the cold had sunk well past the fabric and into his skin, surrounding his bones in a harsh chill. Not that he took the cold well anyways, but this was a bit much. <br><br/>Still. He found himself staring at a woman at some sort. Something about her seemed decidedly <i>wrong </i>to Bria, inhuman, but he acknowledged that a straight man would probably find her attractive. Bria didn't see any of that beauty, though. He saw an enemy, one he intended to destroy, and when she started to attack, he threw out the bolt and...<br/><br/>He missed. So surprised by the lack of an actual attack, the bolt hit a tree next to them, chunks of wood exploding. The woman had clearly tried to attack, and just couldn't. He couldn't hide his smile at her genuine surprise and anger, and before long, he was quietly laughing. A strange sound to anyone that knew Bria, but he couldn't help it. Of course. The townfolks were so incompetent that they couldn't even deal with a frost mage that couldn't use magic. <br/><br/>It took him a moment to speak. \"O-oh dear,\" he said, wiping his eyes. \"Uhm, I assume you're the... the monster that lives above the waterfall?\" He kept interrupting himself with snickering, finding far too much joy in this situation. <br/></br></font>"}, "post-92322": {"user": "Khateera", "user_num": 3441, "timestamp": "1562707907000", "message": "Khateera watched Neia try and fail to freeze them, her face growing into a smile. \"This? is the monster?
