For about the last three days she\u2019d heard all kinds of tales, but most of them turned out to be either falsified entirely or greatly exaggerated. A monstrous creature that killed all that entered the woods, controlled by a powerful witch. Well, that had turned out to be nothing more than a trained brown bear that was domesticated by the local sage, the sage was far from malevolent and had even put on a pot of tea for Grandma!There had been other tales with similarly anticlimactic outcomes, but then Grandma had heard of The Desolate Shore. Going entirely off of what she\u2019d managed to piece together from the locals, this place was a magnet for shipwrecks and all the sailors who knew this area well stayed as far away from it as they could. What had truly gotten her attention was the fact a lighthouse had been built, but then promptly abandoned once all those who manned it were found to have killed themselves. Perhaps all of these things were just another set of odd coincidences that would unravel under Grandma\u2019s scrutiny, but perhaps they were something more. Something worth investigating. And so, that is how Grandma found herself here, slowly making her way towards the desolate outline of the lighthouse.
