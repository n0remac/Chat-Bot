Although everything was dusted, spiderwebs were allowed to remain, and it seemed that candles were the main source of light -- although they shined as brightly as any torch.The paintings on the walls were all classical, and every single one of them depicted some sort of nightmarish event that was obviously fondly treasured by the witches of Castle Loxnighton.Winnie was chatting as they walked, her darling dress swaying about her and her blonde curls bouncing as she turned her head this way and that.

They glanced at Roseanne and giggled amongst themselves, the girls near-ish Roseanne in age and all with their own witchy outfits and familiars.\"You'll begin with charms and potions and managements of spells, most probably,\" Winnie said with a flick of her hand as they turned on the landing to go down the Eastern corridor. \"You're very behind the other students, so you'll most likely be sharing a class with girls half your age.

A tall window that looked outside showed a snowy landscape -- not the one that was currently outside Loxnighton. \"Oh, oh, oh, Miss Winnie, you do know -- you know how I hate when you saw the whole name, such a dreadful name, oh,\" said the voice of a slender, breezy woman that came out from behind a pile of boxes.

Some politely worded criticism hidden behind a pretty smile and well done up hair? No, that is the exact opposite of what they will face. I've seen what they will face, been up to my shoulders in the viscera of the real world. It has teeth, claws, blades and armor, and it will not hold back. I have the scars to prove it. Their favorite target is young mages, mages who freeze up when they see the nasty bandit coming at them, freezing up just long enough to let that blade slip in. Can you teach them to defend against that?\" He snarled at her, sick of her questioning him.\"Fenrir.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"Someone like me? A male? A wolf?

One witch, overly friendly and accommodating. The other, overtly hostile. Neither with any reason to act in the way they did.
