It was certainly crowded for people, but there was one area that seemed to be kept marginally clear with liveried guards outside it was a door.This door was clearly not the servant's door.Once inside, Grandma would upon a very large room with the sound of Rondi conversation filling the air and pockets of people this way and that. There were liveried guards stationed there and all around the room, several doors leading several places, paintings of people she wouldn't know and events that she hadn't known had even taken place.A fancy and almost dandy looking man saw Grandma enter, and he paused the conversation he was having to walk over, the heels of his buckled shoes clacking upon the glossy black-and-white tile floor of the room, and the sun gleaming off of his perfectly bald head. Like the captain at the gate, he sported an exceptional mustache -- indeed, most men in the room did.\"And what have we here?\" he asked in Rondi, assuming that anyone who was within the city and within the Merchant guild hall would know how to speak the language.\u00a0", "link_list": ["/user/602"], "image_list": ["https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/26/e1/7c/26e17cb57b47091eb9821c8790b10fd9.jpg", "https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/3e/89/67/3e8967b8b5c9d33030252767cdef6681.jpg", "https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/23/9f/6c/239f6c19a4550649f5535657754b124d.jpg", "https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/99/ab/bd/99abbd24788155ddb9701233b902fd23.jpg"], "html": "<span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-602 group-0\" href=\"/user/602\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@grandma\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Grandma</span></a></span>"}, "post-63063": {"user": "The Kingdom of Rond\u00f3n", "user_num": 2185, "timestamp": "1492382866000", "message": "Roxanne Fletcher As she walked and turned, she'd find that LaPuerta was not a building, but an ornate archway, and it did not lead to a building, but instead to a green park at the city's center.

He'd been in Zephyr lands trying to track down a nobleman from the titular city. Gabriel knew not the man's name or rank, all he knew was that the man was from Zephyr, that he had one of his father's swords, and he had but one eye. Oh, and he knew that he wanted the man dead.The event had occurred while Gabriel was in Declolla obtaining a shipment of iron. Normal they had it delivered right to the smithy but the last batch had too many impurities so his father decided to send him to inspect this batch before it arrived. When he returned he found his father dead, the culprits already gone. No one was quite sure what happened, all they could tell him is that the one-eyed Zephyr lord had come looking to purchase a blade from the finest swordsmith in Rondon. The lord had been directed to his father's forge and that evening when his mother came to fetch his father for dinner she found him dead, stabbed through the heart.Gabriel had known with certainty that the Zephyr lord was the one to kill his father. He was certain that his father had refused to sell to the filthy Zephyr and the man had killed his father in cold blood stealing one of his father's blade. Gabriel swore vengeance on the spot traveling to Zephyr to look for a man fitting the barebone description he had. That had been nearly four months ago and now all of Zephyr would finally be made to pay for their many crimes and Gabriel would ride with the army to take advantage of this.For only the second time in his life, Gabriel walked the streets of fair\u00a0Rond\u00f3n. The tension was thick in the air as the people prepared for war and the glorious victory to come. Setting his teeth the young man searches for the recruitment office. He had his own sword, and his father's father had been a soldier before becoming a smith and had thought it important that his son know how to wield a blade should he be forging them.

Tawakoshi? Clan Hizashi? \"Bring yourself and two chosen,\" the Captain said directly to Suezo. \"They will be allowed through the gates to meet with the generals for the Rond\u00ed efforts agaisnt Zephyr.

It's been a while since I was in the presence of a royal figure!\" he said and lifted his hat as yet another of the many various gestures he made. Windfeld noted Rafael's hand casually readied at the hilt of his saber, but this was nothing knew when people spoke to Windfeld. Most people would be a little guarded in his presence - and besides the young people liked to puff themselves up when faced with danger. This was trifle though as he had no intention of fighting the young guy. No, the prince was a small sack of precious gold coins in Windfeld's eyes. Or at least he had access to them.\u00a0\"Yes yes... However would I earn the gold if not like that?\" he said and smirked deviously. \"And believe me... I have a few tricks up my sleeve that your 'armada' hasn't. My ship might not be biggest of galleons, but when she fires first - and she usually does - she leaves an impression...\" he said with a faint smile. Windfeld was speaking in riddles, but he really did enjoy the thought of showing this young wellborn some of the finer points of 'pirateering' at some point.\u00a0\"Maybe we'll hold it, maybe we won't...\" was Windfeld's ambiguous answer. \"I can help you take it, but it's not really my 'fort\u00e9' to secure a keep. But I can sure give them something else to think about.\" he said seemed to think back. \"My own thought was too press on from there and put pressure on the bastards and destroy their fleets at Crestwatch and Starwatch. That way we won't have to 'hold' it.\" Windfeld said confidently. The young crown prince may have thought this guy's talk was pure bravado, but Windfeld liked to keep his cards close.\u00a0\"So about the gold! A little beforehand makes for a good mood among the crew I reckon.\" he said and grinned. Rest assured whether the crown prince was generous or not he would see to it that himself and the crew got what they came here for. Besides... He had studied those islands thoroughly through his spyglass and it seems the islands could very well contain the treasures it was rumoured to have inside its 'bowels'.\u00a0", "link_list": ["/post/78601/thread", "/user/2219", "/user/2628"], "image_list": ["https://i.pinimg.com/564x/14/43/62/14436262644b3dd95e952278b2a47e1e.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@rafael\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/78601/thread\" timestamp=\"1516587019\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-2219\" title=\"Crown Prince Rafael Vinicio\"><img alt=\"Crown Prince Rafael Vinicio Avatar\" src=\"https://i.pinimg.com/564x/14/43/62/14436262644b3dd95e952278b2a47e1e.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/78601/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1516587019000\" title=\"Jan 21, 2018 18:10:19 GMT -8\">Jan 21, 2018 18:10:19 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-2219 group-0\" href=\"/user/2219\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@rafael\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Crown Prince Rafael Vinicio</span></a></span> said:</div><span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-2628 group-0\" href=\"/user/2628\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@windfeld\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Windfeld 'Sea-shrieker'</span></a></span> <br><br/>Rafael's gaze was narrowed on the salt-weather captain in front of him, for all that the older, grizzled man displayed a charm that seemed waxed and smooth by the presence of gold and personal gain than it did anything else. <br/><br/>\"Yes, I am Crown Prince Rafael Carlos Montoban de Vinicio,\" he said, enunciating every word as he stepped a little closer and casually rested his hand on the handle of his sabre.

He complimented her country, her people, her, but it was the sort of words that Xiomara had heard a thousand times or more from every manner of dignitary, including Suezo. She was not complimented.

She held out her hand in greeting.<br/><br/>\"Welcome to Rond\u00f3n,\" she said to the foreigner. \"This must be the first visit of your people to my land.

She was beautiful and carried herself with an authority and elegance that seemed striking to Suezo.\u00a0<br/><br/>The pleasentries ended far to early if you asked Suezo.

In fact it was the duty of a pirate to make sure that the captain was strong enough and keep him on his toes.

And tactics could be discussed if Rafael proved to be a man.\u00a0The Crown Prince of Rond\u00f3n reacted instinctively -- after all, he had only recently escaped the Horror of Helmfirth within the last month. Lightning crackled from his electric blue eyes and sizzled down his arm to the hand that clenched around the pommel of his handsome sabre and half-drew it from its scabbard---- before he got a hold of himself. The prince had rocked smoothly onto his back foot, showing that he was trained and did have some talent with the blade. The fine hairs along his back and body and neck were standing on end as static electricity charged through the air, and his glowing gaze narrowed on the Captain Windfeld.\"There won't be a mutiny. I mean to have LasIslas, and so I will. You should not doubt the Rond\u00ed when there is something we want,\" the prince said, aware that the sea dog was closer than he would have liked, but unwilling to back down as well. He was aching and sore from his practice before, but the charge of magic through his blood made him feel as if he had a second wind.\"I would step wisely,\" Rafael cautioned the man, still faintly crackling. \"Your ship may have tricks, but the Rond\u00ed have many, many ships and many, many men that will die for this cause -- or any cause if its for the honor of Rond\u00f3n. We will not lose this war. We've ached for it too long.\"Windfeld's smile turned into a sly grin.\u00a0\"So you do have in you...\" he said and relaxed again. The boy even had some magic abilities on top of what did look like guts. Of course he was inside his own castle with thousands of guards at his disposal, but still Windfeld noticed his determination. He could at least respect that, and since respect between pirates took time to form, this was a compliment to the young prince's attitude and words. It was clearly more than bravado.\"Well this makes me so happy that I didn't get to meet whomever you got that fiery temper from..!\" he said and couldn't help but laugh. \"Don't you worry about my steps. I'm too old not to care about who I step on.\" he said and casually turned around to put a bit of distance between them again. \"The plan you mentioned beforehand...\" he said and mused. \"I'm sure the Rond\u00ed army is better trained and better armed than my men, so it would make no sense to have us guard some barren island. We are sea dogs, and if you let us maneuver freely, I'm sure you'll see the benefit.\" Windfeld said and gave a wide smile to reveal his less than well kept teeth.\u00a0", "link_list": ["/post/78804/thread", "/user/2219", "/post/78710/thread", "/user/2628"], "image_list": ["https://i.pinimg.com/564x/14/43/62/14436262644b3dd95e952278b2a47e1e.jpg", "//storage.proboards.com/6046952/avatar/DFBXBDpphoNPiECWuLUm.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@rafael\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/78804/thread\" timestamp=\"1516848200\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-2219\" title=\"Crown Prince Rafael Vinicio\"><img alt=\"Crown Prince Rafael Vinicio Avatar\" src=\"https://i.pinimg.com/564x/14/43/62/14436262644b3dd95e952278b2a47e1e.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/78804/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1516848200000\" title=\"Jan 24, 2018 18:43:20 GMT -8\">Jan 24, 2018 18:43:20 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-2219 group-0\" href=\"/user/2219\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@rafael\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Crown Prince Rafael Vinicio</span></a></span> said:</div><div author=\"@windfeld\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/78710/thread\" timestamp=\"1516704061\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-2628\" title=\"Windfeld 'Sea-shrieker'\"><img alt=\"Windfeld 'Sea-shrieker' Avatar\" src=\"//storage.proboards.com/6046952/avatar/DFBXBDpphoNPiECWuLUm.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/78710/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1516704061000\" title=\"Jan 23, 2018 2:41:01 GMT -8\">Jan 23, 2018 2:41:01 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-2628 group-0\" href=\"/user/2628\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@windfeld\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Windfeld 'Sea-shrieker'</span></a></span> said:</div>He was an annoying little bugger this one. First he would puff himself up and now he would keep his distance with a chair between them. Was he even qualified to lead anyone if he couldn't take a decision? Windfeld hadn't been captain of his own ship forever, and he knew that an indecisive captain could mean the difference between success or failure. However Windfeld wasn't there to babysit some young noble - and the gold didn't matter if he would lead them all to their doom. In fact it was the duty of a pirate to make sure that the captain was strong enough and keep him on his toes. It would just be a little test.<br><br/>Windfeld ignored Rafael's words for now and with a couple of determined steps he closed the distance kicked the chair away making sure he was within striking distance before putting his hand on the cutlass' hilt intending to draw it.\u00a0<br/>\"What would you do if there was a mutiny... captain?\" Windfeld asked with a sly grin. \"Taking anything from anyone requires that you don't mourn their loss.

Rafael had no idea if he could trust him or not...\"You're a tense guy!\" Windfeld announced and grinned. In some way Windfeld liked this guy, he showed that he was serious about the things he wanted and was going to use any means necessary for him to succeed.\u00a0Looking at the map Windfeld turned to Rafael again. \"I like fish!\" he answered to Rafael's 'hard to interpret' comment intended to put things behind them. Windfeld didn't think there was much to put behind them anyway and he enjoyed teasing him a bit.\u00a0\"Engage the enemy ships?!?! Hahaha!\" Windfeld laughed and slapped his belly. \"Well that's easier said than done! Aren't you going to provide a bit of backup there? I mean she's a pretty boat, bot not exactly a galleon!\" he said and smirked. Sure the pirate's ship was lethal when it mattered, but he much preferred to not be in the line of fire when things got messy. \"Think... 'element of surprise'. Me and my guys are VERY lethal when they don't see us coming.\" Windfeld argued firmly. If they were to be of any help, he needed Rafael to understand how to use their strengths and not see them as another toy ship to send straight into its doom.\u00a0\"My ship is no 'ferry'...\" Windfeld said narrowed his eyes - though of course only one was visible. \"Anyone who steps onto my ship are mine to command.\" he added as if that was not for discussion. \"However you and your men are most welcome under our banner following the ship rules.\" he said and smirked. It was a welcome but one of limited hospitality. Windfeld looked at the caves on the map and mentally marked their position in his mind. In any case a pirate could be trusted at least to take any opportunity given to him, and letting this go seemed foolish to Windfeld - war or not. This however would not mean that he would abandon any former alliances. He might just have to... take a brake from fighting. He was far too curious about where this fight would lead him than to just take the treasure and run.\u00a0\"So... seeing that we agree...\" Windfeld boldly concluded as he brought down a bottle of the blackest rum imaginable on the table. \"Let's drink to it! You like wine in Rond\u00f3n right? Well this is sort of that... With a twist!\" he said as he looked around for any cabinet inside the room with cups or glasses inside. If finding what he looked for he looked for, he would pour the obsidian colored rum until it reached the edge of the glass and downed it after toasting. \"Death to Zephyr! Victory to Rond\u00f3n! And a bit of luck down our throat!\" he said excited as he emptied it in one go keeping a plain face before looking at Rafael to see if he would follow through. \"It's not bad, come on!\" he would encourage. However that would be a straight lie to most normal human beings, the rum being made from whale oil, a malign kind of carnivorous seaweed and the blood of several snakes. It would taste like death and decay, however when the initial shock of the hideous taste combined with a feeling of molting lava in your throat receded, positive effects like near perfect resistance towards cold for days and a stronger and faster communication between mind and muscles would be apparent.\u00a0", "link_list": ["/post/78850/thread", "/user/2219", "/user/2628"], "image_list": ["https://i.pinimg.com/564x/14/43/62/14436262644b3dd95e952278b2a47e1e.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@rafael\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/78850/thread\" timestamp=\"1516926575\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-2219\" title=\"Crown Prince Rafael Vinicio\"><img alt=\"Crown Prince Rafael Vinicio Avatar\" src=\"https://i.pinimg.com/564x/14/43/62/14436262644b3dd95e952278b2a47e1e.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/78850/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1516926575000\" title=\"Jan 25, 2018 16:29:35 GMT -8\">Jan 25, 2018 16:29:35 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-2219 group-0\" href=\"/user/2219\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@rafael\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Crown Prince Rafael Vinicio</span></a></span> said:</div>Rafael's glare did not lift, even at <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-2628 group-0\" href=\"/user/2628\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@windfeld\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Windfeld 'Sea-shrieker'</span></a></span> 's pleased smile that the 'boy' seemed to be on the verge of manhood itself, if not already there and just beginning.

One arm was on the table, a wooden mug gripped in his resting hand, and a leg was sprawled out on the booth, his booted foot next to his cloth sack of personal items, just barely touching. His head was tilted back against the rough backrest of the booth, eyes closed and mouth slightly ajar as he lightly snored. To the untrained eye, the mysterious man appeared to be asleep, the sack by his foot awfully inviting and seemingly easy to take. To the experienced, however, one would notice his free hand resting across his waist, his fingers wrapped around the hilt of his cutlass, and that the sack was just close enough to the man's foot for him to feel it move.Off by the great hearth sat a street urchin warming himself up by the fire. He had been staring at the sleeping man for nearly an hour, making sure he was really, truly, asleep and, before he could be shooed away from the hearth, he slinked off towards the back corner, taking very tentative steps towards the man, careful not to make a noise. Not that it would've mattered much, for the patrons were making enough noise to mask his footsteps. Though his eyes were focused on the man, he did periodically shoot side glances to make sure no one was paying him any attention as he made his way over. None of the patrons so much as looked in the boy's direction. In a dark and seedy place such as this, no one cared enough to stop the boy from his mission to rob his mark.The journey was quick, and the urchin reached out with a small hand towards the cloth sack, making sure to keep his eyes glued to the slumbering man's own. The boy's reach was painfully slow, for he was very careful. Little fingers closed around the rough, thin braided rope keeping the sacked tightly tied, and gently pulled up ever so slighty, but that was enough. Like lightning, the man's cutlass suddenly swung down and smacked the top of the boy's hand with the flat of the blade, seemingly having come from nowhere. The boy sucked in a breath and his brain told his body to recoil, the smack having stung his hand and the movement surprised him, yet he made no move. His eyes dropped to his hand and widened as he saw a single drop of his red blood roll down around his finger and drip onto the sack. Though the flat of the blade was pressing hard on the top of his hand, the highly sharp edge was pressed just enough against his lower knuckles to cut him if he moved too quickly.The man was wide awake now, his blue eyes fully open and staring down at the urchin, a tired smirk playing across his features. His left hand still clutched the tankard. \"Didn't your mother ever teach you not to steal from the poor? You could lose a finger.\" the man asked the boy, his voice a gruff whisper, his accent thick, nearly butchering the Rondi words. The man lifted the cutlass a tad and gestured with his chin. \"Beat it.\" Daring not to respond, not even to mention his lack of a mother, the urchin retreated backward until he tripped, falling on his bum. Panicking, he scrambled on all fours until he was standing and ran out of the tavern, clutching his bleeding hand tightly.Sheathing his cutlass, the man chuckled as he watched the little one scurry out. Good thing, too, otherwise he might've missed the newcomer that had come in. Sitting fully upright and narrowing his eyes, he watched the hooded figure walk to the bar and slip the tavern keeper a gold coin. He might be getting up there in years, but his eyes were still as sharp as a hawk's, and he was experienced enough to know what just took place. The newcomer needed some...advertising done, and that meant work. Work he desperately needed right now.The man had been in the beautiful city of Rond\u00f3n for about two days now, recuperating from his accident. Once upon a time, he had been a ship captain, but his ship was sunk on the bottom Ryel River and he was forced to swim ashore with nothing but what he was carrying...his cloth sack. As far as he knew, none of his crew survived. The memory was recent and bitter, and he tried his best to drink himself into a stupor to dull the ache, but now he was out of funds. He was dirty, smelled of alcohol and piss, and could feel what seemed like wiggling in his chest hair.Standing up from the booth, the man made his way on over to where the cloaked figure sat down and, as the figure began eating his stew, sat across from him without an invite. Up close, the man got a much better look of the figure, yet the natural darkness inside of the tavern, despite the few candles and wall sconces, made it somewhat difficult to notice everything about the man. The figure looked to be about the same age as him, perhaps a few years younger, and had similar color hair.\"Name's Gerald,\" the man said in way of introduction in his poor Rondi. \"What's the job and how much does it pay?\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "In a dark corner of the Red Dragon Tavern laid a man, alone, the faint glow of a candle highlighting his ginger hair, but little else.

No matter, testing the captain's sense of humor wasn't a priority right now. Getting settled into a hammock and getting some shut-eye, that was his main priority. However, before turning around and heading back to the crew quarters, Gerald dropped the heavy sack to the floor, the familiar metallic cranking sounding out, and sat down upon one of the crates loaded with ammunition for a brief rest...or rather, a brief moment of respite to reflect on his current situation. He clenched his jaw muscles and the quickly unclenched them, raising his hand to rub his chin. He was craving some tobacco and sure could use a pipe right about now.Gerald had tasted the sweet nectar of freedom that came from captaining one's own ship, and he'd be damned if he was going to be stuck aboard this ship toiling away under the command of another man. One that was younger, no less! But, alas, he currently had no other choice. That doesn't mean there weren't...things\u00a0he could do to improve his quality of life aboard The Tyger, but those were plans to be thought about later. For now, rest, but, before he stood up, there was one more thing he wanted to do real quick.Hunching over his cloth sack, Gerald carefully untied the intricate knot keeping the sack closed, and opened it. On top and the first thing in sight was a bundle of clothes, a white blouse atop brown trousers. Rummaging through the sack, Gerald quickly found his small basic compass and his water-skin full to the brim of rum, but these were not what he was after. On the very bottom lied two metal bars, near identical in shape and form, each with a small round engraving depicting two galleys rowing into the sunset. It was the seal of a long lost Kingdom, or Empire, Gerald didn't know, he didn't know anything about the bars other than they were gold and heavy. They were his insurance in case anything had gone wrong, and something had gone wrong, but he wasn't ready to part with the last of his fortune to purchase a small galley and a crew he didn't trust. No, he'd have to work his way up and earn a little more, but at least he was already partially there.Now that he was alone in private, he decided to fix his clanking problem, for he wasn't sure when the next chance he'd get to be left alone. Taking his spare shirt, he began ripping it up, tearing it into two different halves, and then he carefully wrapped the gold bars inside the cloth to prevent them from clanking together in the future. Once he was done with that task, he repacked everything back inside his sack, putting in his brown trousers last so they were on top, obscuring everything below, and he then tied a new knot, one more intricate and complicated than before. Sure, he was on board full of fellow sailors who knew their ship knots, but this was vastly unlike that, and he was confident no one would be able to get into it short of ripping it open with a sharp object.With all of that done, Gerald smiled, stood up, and hefted his sack back over his shoulder and walked out of the armory. Once in the crew quarters, he picked a cot in the back corner and pushed his cloth sack of personal effects underneath it. He hadn't noticed another crewmate's personal items and assumed it was vacant. If it wasn't, well, they'd just have to find a new one, this one was Gerald's now. Settling in comfortably in the hammock, Gerald closed his eyes, still wearing that slight smile upon his face, and drifted off to sleep, the slight rocking of the ship like a lullaby...", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Unfortunately, it seemed as if the captain had seen through Gerald's jest, and with nary a smile too!

The great stone building housing the office of maritime commerce overlooked the busy docks, though it was no less busy than the scene below. It was rarely otherwise, especially with a war on. Captains, entrepreneurs, and merchants of all races looking to get official seals for maritime ventures, looking for sponsorship for expeditions of exploration and future ventures, looking for charts of specific shores and shoals for navigation, crowded the main lobby, clamoring to get a place at a queue. Overworked and underpaid bureaucrats attempted to help with their needs, but most proved quite demanding, causing long lines that started outside the door.

'connections' to far off shores looking for 'cargo'. See him for the crews.

He'd been lead through the courtyard and through the halls and was able to see how many servants and people were at work, moving certain pieces of furniture and artwork as the queen had proclaimed Vinicio, once the capital of Zephyr, the new capital of all of Rondon.It was not a shock to anyone -- she'd named the city after her own house, so that its grandeur may live on, and the city was larger and more modern and located on an arm of the River Ryel. It made sense to move the capital somewhere with access. She had other generals and engineers working on how to make it less of a target than it had been during the war.But that was then. This was now.In the ante chamber the count was led to, the queen was waiting.She must have been almost forty, but she wore her age daringly well. Her body was still curved and lush, her mature beauty like a fine wine that just got better with age. Her dark hair was swept up high on her head, and her golden eyes were highlighted with shadows so one never really knew what she was thinking. She was gowned in burnished copper and gold, a thick crown settled on her dark hair, and a necklace of golden topaz and peridot around her elegant neck.She was, quite simply, exquisite.\"Count DeRuiz,\" she said his name, her voice low and thick, like honey spiked with Rondi wine. \"Thank you for attending me.\" She waved her hand and the servants disappeared as she rose from her seat and walked to a table that had maps rolled out. The current rumor was that her daughter, the crown princess Arenna, had run away from her iron-fisted ways. The young girl -- said to already be as beautiful as her mother -- was wild and bucked against the grain.Indeed, Princess Arenna was a prize, and Queen Xiomara was not above using her as a tool to get wiley noblemen to behave. Her son, her hair, Prince Rafael, was in Vinicio, preparing the city and the castle with an accumen that brought pride to the advisors and councilers that had helped hone and raise him. Everyone was saying that he'd make a wonderful king, and that he was now a young war hero only served to further romanticize him.Xiomara, of course, made sure that this was how it was all spun. She was a Queen, after all, and had been Queen on her own since she'd come into it at a young age when no one thought a woman could rule or rule wisely -- when many thought that once she'd marry, she'd give up power. All she gave them was a funeral, and once she'd had her children, she'd decided on marrying no more. Lovers, however?

She'd come to think of the crew as her friends. And she couldn't figure why would anyone think otherwise? Mr. Walworth was a little intimidating, of course but nothing that was too bad.

He found himself reminiscing on the days between from when he had become an orphan, and his escape on what he thought was a merchant ship, that turned out to be a pirate vessel. He was among those powder monkeys that spread sand on the ship as two vessels came into a melee, to soak up blood on the deck to keep men from slipping.

She slipped off the back of her beautiful horse and made her way briskly inside...... by the time she made it to their room, it had only been a minute or more. There was no more hat upon her head, but the riding outfit she was wearing\u00a0was stiill upon her. Her golden eyes were incredible and focused as they looked from man to girl and back again, not unlike the eyes of a lioness on the savanna. Her beauty was austere and untouchable, her bearing regal and also militant -- clearly, she needed no crown upon her head.\"Thank you for coming,\" she said, her Rondi accent as rich as wine as she pulled her riding gloves from her hands, very at home in the oppulent room of the 'old' palace of Rondon.
