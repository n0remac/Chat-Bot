If you do not learn this quickly, then you do not deserve the loyalty of more than a single dragon.\"When he got close enough to say that he was part of the gathering now, the dragon turned his snout towards\u00a0Kyzakriel. \"Do not misunderstand me.

There was always the chance that he could try to snap her in his jaws and be done with it, but Nerwendel was confident enough in her speed that she was sure she could simply evade it. She was not expecting violence, but she hoped that the presence of Kyzakriel would serve as a potent factor in deterring aggressive behaviour until she had the chance to prove herself. \"I admit that I do not know every dragon by name, but your size is an unmistakable indicator of your identity.

Besides, sometimes it takes a person we perceive to be a fool to show us the truth,\" she told him. She would not stay by him, instead knowing that she had more dragons to address. They hadn't left yet, which at least gave her the opportunity to speak further and try to gauge their minds and ways. Next she approached Asaph, Dream Hunter, her wings glinting in the dying sunlight as she lowered herself to be his equal in height. \"What is your name?\" She asked him, examining him closely from her new position. \"You are clearly wise, and correct in what you say. I realise I address no ordinary gathering, yet a gathering it is and I cannot speak to the individuals in it until I have spoken to it as a whole.\" She took a pause to look around her, then set her attention back on the dragon. \"I cannot claim to be as well-versed in the histories as you surely are, but I know for certain that I do not lack understanding of the importance of the past. You call yourself a lover of both combat and ancient things; with me you will be able to pursue both. There are no more worthy beings to aid me in governing what I aim to create than yourselves and if you wish to preserve and protect history, then preserve and protect it we shall.\"After speaking she again left, her wings carrying her towards her third critic: Neva-Svir-Suna, Wavewarden. Nerwendel touched down before her, her own wings folding in at her back. \"Then you must be the one they call the Wavewarden, or am I wrong? You too are correct! I do not aim to solely pursue conquest, but to explore and settle empty lands. And am I not here, now, attempting to peacefully persuade you to join me? I cannot claim I can do so without issue, for despite my blood I am not a god wielding all-power, nor the ability to cast a spell and have you love me. But at least allow me to explain my reasoning for what I am attempting to do.\"With that she unfurled her wings and set off into the air again until she could see and address the gathered dragons as a whole. She looked briefly to Kyzakriel behind her, but soon continued speaking.\"It is true I wish to prove myself, just as it is true that I have an ambition to form a mighty empire - through conquest if need be. But I am no simple warmonger, nor am I a violent thug or bandit who wishes nothing more than power for power's sake and gold enough to fill a temple. My father is god, yet my mother is not; she is from the people known as the Esharran, who reside in the floating city of Esharra that sits in the clouds and radiates glory and beauty. From the part of me that is Esharran, I know what it is to be a mortal man or a woman in this world; to taste mortality and all their desires. The kingdoms and empires of this world lack meaning, caring only for their own inherent desire to do terrible things and to wage war for petty personal ambition. Their leaders are either good-hearted but weak, or corrupt and possibly even tyrannical. For their own personal grievances they will march armies against their offenders and lay waste to the farms and the villages that occupy their countries! They will murder and rape the people who live there for no better reason than the thrill it gives them in the heat of the moment, and once victory or loss have been achieved they will return back to their towns and their castles awaiting for the endless cycle of revenge to begin anew.\"My goals are beyond that. How long until this world erupts into an age of war and chaos? Even now, they speak of magical gems that cause tension and power play between nations. At any moment, growing hostilities could tip them over the edge and cause warriors to mobilise for war. Now, I know many of you are no doubt asking yourself if I am a hypocrite? Then I will answer you yes, I am! It is the side of me that is mortal, for to be mortal is to be hypocritical. Yet my divinity allows me to see beyond that, to see a true purpose that I must fulfil at all cost! I speak of war and conquest, but my goal is to end all war and conquest! If some of you will aid me, you dragons who are so mighty and wise, then I can create an empire and unite all under one banner. I can paint the biggest picture of them all; endless peace.

I did not say general and war. Your answer was as good as could be expected from someone like you, but the answer I sought was 'to win without fighting', something I doubt you are capable of.\"I admit, the second question was more difficult, and perhaps more subjective. But higher purpose is far from what I had in mind. In fact, in my seven centuries of study and experience, I have found that the strongest motivator of human gallantry is in fact one of the most primordial: survival. In those same seven centuries I have found that the only thing higher purpose is correlated with is body count. No, the answer I was looking for was a skill, a very important skill for a commander which once again I doubt you possess: deception. You see, a true commander knows to appear weak when they are strong, and strong when they are weak, to strike where attack is not expected, and withhold where attacking is obvious, to use intelligence and spies as well as swords and thunderbolts. While this may seem dishonorable, it is battles fought with deception that result in minimal loss of life on both sides. A true general wins battles easily and without fuss, without staining the battlefields in blood. Thus it is a paradox that songs of glory and honor are not written of the worst generals, but also not of the very best.Your answers have given me great insight into your lack of experience as well as your contempt for your enemy.

Even a rat can be deceptive; a spider, a cowardly thief. But higher purpose? A man who fights only for himself and his own greed is the lowest of all warriors.
