It is ruled by the High Priest of Light, and all the citizens are avid followers of his teachings. The people of the town are all very religious and can be rather xenophobic at times, although the innkeepers and tavern owners are usually friendly enough to outsiders.

As for the church...\"He took a deep breath, then began.\"Thousands of years ago, mankind wallowed in darkness. The Light was confined to the heavens, and never fell upon the earth. However, a man named Lumen was not satisfied to live in the darkness, illuminated by only the dim light of a campfire. Thus, he set out and climbed Mount Grim, to retrieve the Light from the heavens. As he went up, he met his first great challenge: the beast of Mount Grim. Many others had tried to climb the mountain before, but they had all failed. None had managed to slay the beast. However, Lumen chose a different path. He brought a selection of meats to appease the beast, and showed it kindness rather than trying to slay it. It allowed him to pass, and thus we have the First Teaching of Lumen: kindness to animals.\"He opened his robe, revealing a large pocket on the inside. A small kitten sat in the pocket, its head sticking out. It meowed at Kelly, and Lucian petted its head before continuing.\"As he went, he met his second great challenge: the beggars of Mount Grim. They were the ones who had lived on the mountain their entire lives, shrouded in darkness. They flocked to his torch, begging him to stay with them and let them use his light. They refused to let him go, as his torch was the only light most of them had ever seen. Rather than stay forever, he gave them the torch, and moved on in darkness. This brings us to the Second Teaching of Lumen: kindness to the downtrodden, and those who the light has not yet touched.\"If Kelly looked around at this point, she would see that all the townsfolk were silent, listening intently.\"The third great challenge was when Lumen had almost reached the top. Just as he was about to climb to the peak, he found a great gate in his way. It was guarded heavily, and owned by the baron of Mount Grim. He owned the mountain, and was perfectly content with the darkness. It allowed him to rule over the poor, and thus he prevented anybody from accessing the Light. Lumen fought his way through the gate, and flung the baron off a cliff and into a dark pit at the bottom, where the light would never reach. This is the Third Teaching of Lumen: those that reject the Light and shall forever walk in darkness. He broke through, climbed to the peak, and took the Light from the heavens. Lumen brought the Light back, and let it shine on mankind so that we may thrive. Thus, Lumen is our Savior: He brought us the Light. The Light illuminates us, and shields us from the darkness. It keeps us warm and safe. It shall not be defiled, so the Light must not fall upon sordid or profane objects or activities. That's why everyone's alcohol is in covered mugs.
