Another kingdom. Another collection of kingdoms. Another set of loyalties, and another set of rivalries. No doubt Sam was going to get entangled in some sort of conflict between powerful people. It happened every time he came to a new world.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The puppet masters sent him to these new worlds. Sam knew not why. Sam questioned whether or not \"Why?\" was even the right question to have in mind. Nevertheless, he hobbled slowly along this wide, mostly empty road. To each of his sides were hills of grapes growing on little sticks; the sun glazed him just as much as it did these grapes. With each step he took he felt a peering presence staring him down. It was probably the sun.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sam always felt uncomfortable under its heavy, humid oppression.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Along the road, there were little stones that had loosened themselves from the cobble. They were free from their purpose, and as such free to the kicked away in playful boredom as Sam stopped to gaze from under his cloak at the beauty that is civilization just ahead on the near horizon. Situated atop a hill, a town that he had no name for as of yet sat, with a rather pretty body of water just down the landscape following his left.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He wondered, if he cleared his mind, would he hear the name of this place? An answer from beyond? \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dare not, he told himself. It was silly to think that for such easily learned answer. Without worry, Sam knew that he would eventually hear its name once he entered. For now, he continued his hunched limp onward, following this winding road to its end.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0DeRuiz, he overheard, as he entered its streets. Sam wasn't quite sure as to who said it, as there were no obvious conversations occurring, as for this instance, DeRuiz was quiet and calm, with nobody in sight. Something prodded him to close his eyes and listen.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Using his walking stick to balance, he breathed slowly, standing in the middle of DeRuiz's empty street. A brown-striped cat meandered around him, giving him a few inquisitory sniffs, but then it hurried off into an alley close-by. After an absurd amount of introspection, Sam heard a voice within his mind. It spoke to him. It ordered him, but not in the traditional sense. It merely told him that there was a library nearby, and that one could learn everything one could need to know about this world to live within it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Comically, the voice gave Sam directions. Right, right, straight, left, straight, left, left, straight, right. He obeyed, and carried his frail body along these shaded paths, all the way until he came to a wooden door.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Open it.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And he did, pushing the door inwards at an ever questioning creak, as to see if he was even welcome, and if this was, in fact, a library.
