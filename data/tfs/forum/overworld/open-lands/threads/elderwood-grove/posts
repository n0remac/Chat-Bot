Elderwood trees, usually extremely rare and sought-after for their remarkably strong and fire-resistant wood, grow in abundance here. These trees grow for thousands of years, and can reach seemingly impossible sizes. The dense canopy lets little sunlight through, so the forest floor is fairly bare and shrouded in mist and shadows. Any explorer had best be careful and make sure to leave a clear trail, as it's very easy to get turned around in the endless twilight.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/LysvWre.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/LysvWre.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}, "post-72660": {"user": "Gram Tyrfing", "user_num": 2501, "timestamp": "1504623280000", "message": "To many, the elven folk had roots as deep as the Elderwood to ancient forests such as this fabled place.

It was not the firsttime the elven smith had made his way into the forest, the rare wood a painfully frustrating material to work with but endlessly rewarding and beautiful in the end. But his ears listened to the song of steel and flame, not wood and earth. It would not be the first time he might have misstepped.With his hand resting on his blade at his hip, and the other holding the axe riding on his shoulder, he would certainly not allow this to be his last trip into the Elderwood. He was not greedy, though, and he was not foolish as some humans often were; he wandered only as deep as need be which still left him with enough discomfort. He marked the trees as he traveled, fully aware that the olde ways of this place may yet try and trick him even with those markings.For now, he hummed under his breath, the same tune his father, and his father's father sang at the forge, to stoke his own courage and assuage his distrust with the olde ways of the forest.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "To many, the elven folk had roots as deep as the Elderwood to ancient forests such as this fabled place.

All he had been doing was hunting for a meal, but apparently, he sought after what that direwolf\u00a0had already decided to make its dinner.\u00a0Behind Keph was a rabbit - a dead rabbit - a rope was tightly wrapped around it, pulling its battered corpse after the young man. A more sensible person would've no doubt by now released the critter, after all, it was likely the direwolf\u00a0would leave him along if he were simply to drop it, and the meat was rather beat up from being dragged across the forest floor, but dammed be him if he was about to announce that anything and anyone could take his food if they just happened to be large enough and have the appropriate amount of sharp teeth!Over that root...Keph almost fell, but as usual, he managed to regain his footing.Watch out for that tree...He'd briefly looked behind him, to check on the direwolf's\u00a0progress, this almost causing him to run right into a tree, but just barely he managed to swiftly step to the side and narrowly avoid it, only getting lightly scratched as its branches tried to keep him.Orc...It appeared a greenskin's corpse would be able to take the glory of getting Keph to lose his balance. The young man dropped face-first into the ground, the familiar taste of dirt invading his mouth, yet he had no time to don\u00a0on that as the direwolf was still on his tail.\u00a0Keph rolled onto his back, then somehow, although panicking, managed to pull out his shortsword in a nick of time. The direwolf, noticing the young man's dilemma and not wanting to lose out on a larger meal than a small critter, leaped towards him, just as it did, he held the blade upwards, the beast stabbing its chest into it. Now in a fit of rage and fueled by its instinct to survive, it began to claw at Keph, yet its paws could only reach the ends of his arms. Its maw attempted to bite at his face, managing to get close yet still inches away. Meanwhile, Keph was making the herculean effort to hold the beast away, one hand pressing the blade deeper into its chest - causing it to let out an agonized sound - while the other did the best it could to push it back, his legs flailing about, occasionally managing to knee it.\u00a0Young Keph grit his dirt-covered teeth, the saliva of the direwolf\u00a0dripping upon his face, and for whatever reason his figure appeared to be getting dimmer, darker; he was in quite the pickle and it was obvious that he was going to need more than a bit of help.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<i><br>It was just a freaking rabbit!\u00a0</br></i>"}, "post-87207": {"user": "Chesknight", "user_num": 2708, "timestamp": "1542989852000", "message": "One of the few things the Chestknight only rarely had to worry about were animals.

Yet, without any forthcoming explanation, the Knight at last turned his attention past the paper to the stranger beyond. \"Can you understand me?\" The question was practically a shout! Not an angry, aggressive shout, but one a genuine attempt at communication. Of course, it was the way of anyone, big or small, to speak more loudly in order to be understood. Even if being understood required an entirely different language! Then, seeing an opportunity, the knight pointed to himself. \"I am the Chesknight! I picked up the wolf because I am strong!\" Still shouting, of course. The sword question, however, gave him pause. My, that was quite a long time ago, and a story not to be told among the dead.\u00a0\"Who is Keph? Who are you? Is Keph with you?

The process didn't appear to be easy by any means on the fae though as her expression became strained. She was still weakened from her body's fight against the poison. But her desire to have the vampire out of her woods appeared to win out as she exhaled with finality. Tendrils of fire slowly bloomed from her hand, surrounding their interlocking hands. The tendril slowly crept up his arm to his shoulder blade that was burning fiercely by now before diving down. The flame burned straight through his clothing without hesitation, only looking for its final destination. The cursed mark flared brightly for a moment- so much so if Vasco had been watching he had to turn away- before the fae finally spoke. \"I free you of my curse. You are to leave these woods and not return or again this mark will burn.\" For a moment there was nothing then, it felt like the pressure in his shoulder was finally released with a sharp spark. The light died down and the tendril of fire that had singed his clothing retreated back down his arm. His flesh would tingle slightly but the forest suddenly appeared far less dense and brighter around him. Kaelie sighed as she released his hand and fell back against the trunk, spent. \"Now get out of here.
