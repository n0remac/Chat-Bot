Despite Mic's best attempts to get his Father's notes out to the world, Mic couldn't surmount his Mother's protectiveness of her late Husband.He pondered the thought for a second. It was a throbbing, painful memory that left a bitter taste in his mouth. Then, he snapped back to reality.Back and forth Mic's feet pedaled, steadily moving him down the forest trail. He swung from left to right on his bicycle as he leaped down the windy path. His backpack was huge and loftily chucked his scrawny body from side to side, barely managing to hold on. He weaved in and out of the hard oaks: the low-hanging willows, the proud pines. He skipped up and down the upturned rocks and roots, bouncing on his wheels with a crunch, as he set off down a hill. He was engrossed in his dare-devil riding. His brow knitted in concentration. Each hill he bounded down he got more caught up in his little world.The rune he was looking for was the Fog-Major rune. He could extract this rune using one of his Father's vials, with a little runic sealant on the cap. He wasn't sure exactly what the rune was for, but he recognized its name in his Father's notes. As a keen reader of the Rune Encyclopaedia: he'd memorized a great list of runes and thus could identify where to locate the Fog-Major rune. However, he had unluckily skimmed over his Father's work, missing the section on 'Isolating the Fog-Major and Fog-Minor' rune. As any experienced runeologist would know it's a common amateur mistake. But an amateur is what an amateur is: someone who loves what they do. In the eyes of Mic, everything to do with runes is a blissful adventure.Spotting a line of coming fog, he skidded his bicycle, ending his breakneck race at the base of the hill. He looked to the sky, then down to his pocketwatch to make sure of the time. The nasties come out around six-ish and so he had a couple hours. This should be the right amount of time to catch a sample of the rune. He hitched his bike to a nearby log, then made a few steps towards an opening into the wood. His foot grazed a stone and he stumbled a bit, tipping forward. Catching himself, he looked from side to side, to see if anyone was there. The atmosphere was cold and dank and much different to the outside environment.

Unclapsing the seal, the backpack spewed out its tightly-bound contents: twenty golden-capped jars. Mic grabbed them up with a frenzy, making sure none of the jars could roll away. He filled his hands quickly, clinking the glass together. With that, he looked down to check if all of the jars had been accounted for. Mic let out a sigh of relief at the sight: he hadn't loss but one of the jars. They were very important.

His brain, given the extra time to process the situation, could only interpret the yell as him having caught someone off-guard. If they had been some kind of fighter, this wasn't the attack they would have chosen. Thankfully, Mic's panic and the distance between them had actually put him the perfect distance to catch the jar. As his body caught up with his brain, the energy faded and his arms snapped up to ease the jar into a cradle without breaking it. \"Sorry, huh. Really gotta watch out for what you're doin', if I was any meaner I probably would've lopped your head off.\" Sangrei walked into sight for the young man, chuckling a bit at his fearful expression. \"T's fine.
