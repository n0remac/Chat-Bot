Carved from the rocks in which it is set, and built upon by timber and metals, the city is a jumble, much like its people. A community that began to thrive in darker times, started by those seeking to escape what was above. The hunted. Wrongly, many of them claimed. Though the truth of the matter has been long lost.Central Th\u00edos is a stunning sight to behold. The castle within the cavern is imposing, seeming to be at one with the earth itself. Proud and almost leering. It is home to many. Or, those many who are lucky, who carry trades and whose families have resided in Th\u00edos for hundreds of years. There are many who are not so lucky. The Hookies* are the suburbs of Th\u00edos, constructed as the population grew, their wooden limbs clinging onto the walls of the castle for support, holding on for miles and miles. Inside the castle is a hub of culture, art and community; beyond that, poverty and crime reigns. Th\u00edans are often mentioned in a negative manner. With derogative terms such as \u2018worms\u2019 being popular, and the city itself being referred to as simply \u2018Hell\u2019. However, like any place, the city has its sore spots but also some truly spectacular ones. The main qualm with outsiders is that there is no daylight. Th\u00edos is lit by torches and crystals. Th\u00edans hardly see this as an issue, and for those whose ancestry resides under the ground, their senses differ from those up above. Many Th\u00edans cannot look at natural sunlight and require special protection to go above. It has become a fashion statement to wear items over the eyes, from crowns to cloths, to show their prowess at navigating in pitch black. Th\u00edans tend to be shorter than average. They are usually pale, with light eyes of all kinds of hues. There is a sort of impish charm to them, and they are known for being very boisterous and straight-forward, with an unusual sense of humour.Loyalty is honoured above all else in Th\u00edos, and treachery is the most convicted crime, of which people pay with their lives. The government was set up as a democracy, but as the community grew and divisions were made, a noble family has emerged. Some oppose this, and Th\u00edos has become increasingly unstable.Th\u00edos\u2019 main source of income comes from its mines, where natural resources are harvested. But as of late, the deeper they dig, the stranger are the things that are discovered. Discoveries that are desperate to be hidden. Odd happenings are beginning to occur within Th\u00edos, and a toxic mixture of greed and fear is spreading through the city\u2026Notable places in The City of Th\u00edos: Th\u00edos Tower: the largest tower, home to nobility and the government halls.Ceol Street: the cultural hub of Th\u00edos, where you will find theatres, libraries, shops, museums, galleries and bars.Criostail Gardens: a public park within the castle walls, dotted with greenery and sculptures.The Vaults: located in the catacombs, rows of abandoned tombs host a less wholesome part of the city. Here lies the black market and magic dealers of Th\u00edos.GROUP PAGE*Coming Soon: [Th\u00edos] Litri\u00faLitri\u00fa was opened five years ago, hailed as a new coming for Th\u00edos. A new-found treasure trove that would bring riches to the city. A new community was built here, where they had discovered a cavern brimming with gemstones. The town was built from stone, glowing in grandeur. However, as excavation began, it became evident that all was not as it seems. Everything here seemed a little too perfect. Almost as though someone else had already made it their home. Litri\u00fa undoubtedly had a magical essence. One that was not respected. No one is entirely sure what happened. But Litri\u00fa now lies in ruin. Some still venture there as the riches remain. Not all return. The cavern itself seems untouched. But the towering stone pillars and spiralling towers of the town lay crumbled along the magnificent walkways, littered with debris\u2026 and skeletons.", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/post/84895/thread", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/post/84893/thread", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/post/84885/thread"], "image_list": ["https://image.ibb.co/mLmqc9/City.jpg"], "html": "<font size=\"2\">Visitors must report to and post in <a href=\"http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/post/84895/thread\" rel=\"norewrite\" target=\"_blank\">Neamh Falls</a> before entering and posting here.<br/></font>"}, "post-84960": {"user": "Rook", "user_num": 2900, "timestamp": "1536539239000", "message": "While his invitation had been earnest enough, Rook soon found the guard's infectious giddiness wore off.

Releasing it into the air like a dove, a dandelion-like seed hovered in the air, releasing a surprisingly ample green glow. Following along at his mental command, Rook scrutinized the permit papers with feigned interest, if only to seem as if he'd made the attempt. \"Man I wish I could read.\" he said aloud, his ears twitching at the uncomfortable echo. With a shrug he stuffed the papers unceremoniously into his satchel, crushing them without a care at he looked around at the cold world around him. Where he had imagined a warren, like what moles or rabbits might secret themselves away in, small, comfortable burrows suitable for living he found nothing but cold, uninviting stone. Stone that the warmth of day had never before touched. The thought made him slightly queasy, it made him feel trapped. He had come here seeking adventure, had he not? It wouldn't do to flee at so small a thing. Picking over the stones he soon grew used to walking over them, although the bioluminescent light that tagged along with him cast eerie, strange shadows that made his footing uncertain at times. How humans could manage it with their big floppy feet he could never imagine. For a time, travelling down this never ending tunnel, he thought perhaps he might never see anything beautiful again. Only grim stone, and ugly, fierce shadows that seemed to encroach upon him when he wasn't looking. Yet, at last he made a turn, rooted in place at the sight before him. It was an exquisitely crafted monument, something he more closely might attribute with stories of dwarves or kobolds rather than humans. A city of stone! Immediately his tail reacted, flicking to-and-fro at the sight. It was beautiful, in its own way. Cold and jagged compared to the forest and earth he had knownand loved, as if it were an alien existence from his own. Yet, its beauty was pallid, enchanting in its haunted way. He imagined it might burn his eyes were he to see it in the daylight and, for a moment, fantasized what it might look like beneath the moon. Yet, all across it, wooden structures hung. Like tumors, feeding off its host. It was no perfect dollhouse, no isolated existence. It was made by humans, its soul mortal. He closed the distance to it, showing his permit to any that looked his way, whether they were guards or not. It was only natural that he was drawn to the Criostal gardens, and he soon found himself reveling in the sight of greenery, even so far removed from what he was familiar with. He need only wait for his time to come, he knew. He'd show them what he was capable of.

A very controversial matter.\u201dHer tone was matter-of-fact, though she meant it in quite a teasing way. Alva glanced at Rook in a judging up and down sweep that lingered on his legs.

She was certain of herself, a not unattractive feature. \"I forget that humans have such narrow perceptions of race.\" Rook mused as she explained the situations involving her appearance. As they passed crowds of wandering eyes, Rook waved at them, thinking it may be him they were interested in. \"Your standards for controversy are very low.\" whether he considered she was serious or joking about the matter, he smiled plainly. A lifetime of prejudiced was as alien to him as she was to her own people. The Satyr was keenly aware he was being watched, and it was no curious onlooker. She was inspecting him, taking in his differences. When she at last mentioned his legs, however, he grinned. Unlike his smile from before this one held an edge of competition as he glanced her up and down in response. \"Much faster than a human! Have you not seen a deer outrun your floppy feet?\" he asked rhetorically, although realized most of these people probably hadn't indeed if they lived in this den. Without awaiting a response he waved a hand, and rather than his light following above him it flew on to outpace him. With the leap of a mountain goat he cleared a not insignificant distance.

Taking the stairs 5 or 6 at a time, they sped their way upwards. Then across a walkway. Then some more stairs. And another walkway. A few more stairs. There, they would come to a halt. Her hood had stopped doing its job, which she was grateful for, as she was slightly out of breath and the slight breeze felt good as it brushed past her face.They stood on an abandoned turret in the quiet. Her breathing was heavy as she was a little out of breath. The space was empty apart from a large flagpole. But instead of a flag, it held a rope. If one were to let their gaze follow the rope, it would travel from where it was tied, far into the distance, growing as thin as a thread, until it disappeared into the shady structures of the Hookies. It hung above the city \u2013 a mode of transport.Alva took a step up onto the wall that circled the top of the turret and looked out over her city. It was a sight to behold. A bustling, glowing nest of civilisation, beating like a heart in the darkness. She stood strangely steady for someone who could fall to their death at the slightest falter.

It was dark, in unfamiliar terrain, yet she ran across it as if it were nothing more than a dirt road. A mild inconvenience stripped away by experience and superior darkvision. In an instant it had turned from a show into a true competition and the Fey found himself at a disadvantage. A test of speed against a human, and he was struggling! It was absolutely thrilling, with each leap it was as if he were sailing through a sea of darkness, landing in the faint light he had created before it plunged him into it once again in search of a new place to land. Back-and-forth it raged, and she was not the only one getting breathless. Humans were known for their stamina, after all, and as they both climbed the turret, Rook scraped to a halt beside her, narrowly avoiding his momentum carrying him from the edge. Now that would have been an embarrassing way to die. The sight of the city sprawling beneath them was one of alien beauty, and for a moment they fey was enraptured by it. A world of these humans, locked away from sunlight in a stone tomb of their own design. Had she merely wanted to show him this place, so far from the others? No, she didn't seem the type.  He turned his golden gaze, nearly luminescent in the darkness, towards her, brow furrowing as she asked if he held any fear. \"I respect heights. I'm not afraid of anything.\" he lied. He didn't much care for wasps.

The usually still Thios air whipped past her face, bringing blood to the surface and tying her hair in knots before leaving. The city twinkled below, thousands of fireflies dancing in the dark. Up here, so far in the black, no one would see from down below no matter how hard they squinted. As she began to cross into the Hookies, the smell of smoke began to welcome her, along with the odd passing of a structure that seemed far too close for comfort.Knots in the rope from which she was suspended began to slow her descent, but hitting the runway was always somewhat of a disaster. The buildings were rushing by in a far more concentrated manner now, and the smell of smoke was joined by wisps of it that she disturbed as she came in to land.With a manoeuvre that she never quite got used to doing, she flung herself onto the platform after freeing herself from the line. She landed hard and rolled over to soften the blow, coming to a stop in a crouch. Straightening up with a small groan, she flexed her hands that were a little sore from literally holding on for dear life. An old man sat in his doorway. The platform could also be considered his front yard. He chewed his tobacco and gave her an amused, slightly judgemental look, but said nothing.Alva wasn\u2019t sure if she was expecting Rook.

He was not unsettled by the absence his own light, the small puff disappearing as its magic died. He was going to fast for it, too fast for anything to keep up with, he suspected. When the first knot jerked his arm he felt a brief pang of concern, before realizing the subsequent knots were too uniform to be accidental. Unfortunately he did not have the luxury of seeing the platform he was to land on. Nor where the rope ended. With a throttling lurch that nearly tore his arm out of its socket he met the end, yelping as he hit the deck with a painful-sounding thud. One he was keenly aware no one was willing to inspect.
