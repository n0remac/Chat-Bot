A commoner, a man, neither too young, nor too old. His throat had been slit, his eyes plucked out, his tongue taken away. It looked like all ten of his fingers had been smashed, and he was hung from a rope around a branch -- hastily done, it appeared -- from under his arm pits.Rigor mortis had set in by the time they got him down -- no pants, no boots, no belt, only a shirt for decency. Hard to tell if he'd been unwashed, or if it had been an effect of after his death. It was easy to assume that this was meant as a warning to anyone passing through these woods, that Dreigh took its laws seriously, and this could be the punishment.Duke Nicolas and his men marched a little further, and this time -- two bodies were found. Another man much like the last, but the second one was young -- no more than fourteen years old. Each had born the same treatment as the last man, and like the last man, he was relatively \"fresh.\"A little further --More bodies.But this time, it became clear. Written in terrible Rondi were the words:This is what happens to Rondi Bastards.As Duke Nicolas got closer to the territory that Dreigh marked as theirs, they found more bodies, and this time -- they did not distinguish by age. They did not distinguish by gender. Children were hung to die. Mothers. Grandfathers. Sons. Scholars. Tradesmen. And soon it became apparent that the slice to their throat was the last mercy afforded to them -- they had all been alive when they had been tortured, with an occasional variance between them.There were so many bodies that it could be roundly surmised... The the Village of Dreigh had either rounded up every single person in the village that might have been Rondi... or they went searching for them and slaughtered them, all for the benefit of Duke Nicolas Soult and his men.The woods were also thick with boobie traps, claiming the lives of a few Rondi men who were not more careful where they stepped. Scouts finally reported to the Duke that a hastily-constructed, but magically-reinforced wooden Palisade had been erected all around the land-area of the town...\"And...\" the scout hesitated in his speech to the Duke, swallowing and wiping his mouth. \"... it is manned by women. and children, with a few men to lead them, sir.\"________________________________________________________________Advance from the River from Rondon to DreighAs the ships from Rondon to Dreigh got closer, they'd find first one floating body... then another, and another, and just like in the forest for Duke Nicolas, the Rondi began to realize that it was not just strangers in the water, but kinsmen, with rustic signs around their neck to detail why it was they were dead.The smell of smoke and fire was in the air, and as the ships continued to sail, they'd see that Dreigh had set fire to its own ports so that no ship could land at it. Indeed, floating pieces of that fire were coming \"down\" river toward them, and wooden pikes had been fastened in the beaches to prevent the larger ships from going aground there.Smaller ships could make it -- and so could rowboats -- but that left the Rondi open to the dreary darkness of the woods that surrounded them, and the shadow of the palisade that had wrapped around the village inside.", "link_list": ["/user/1586"], "image_list": [], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><br/></div>"}, "post-78825": {"user": "Duke Nicolas Soult", "user_num": 1586, "timestamp": "1516891373000", "message": "A few days prior to the departure of the Rondi forces, good news, though disguised as bad news, had come to the Duke and his army.

Even without a shield, he was more confident than the other men, because unlike them he could see the arrows coming... he could track them with his eyes. Casually he picked up a coil of rope and grappling hook from the poor sod next to him who took a crossbow bolt to the neck, the man still gurgling blood as Zavius took it from his ever loosening grip. Grappling hook in hand, he drew his sword in the other and began his advance at a brisk run, finding the slow advance of his comrades to be tiresome. Immediately, he drew the attention of more than a few sharpshooters upon the wall as he ran out ahead. A hail of arrows would begin to fly towards Zavius as he ran forward, but with a flash of his blade, he cut the arrows out of the air, the projectiles falling uselessly at his feet. The archers would have no time to shoot another volley before he was at the foot of the palisade, having circumvented the lit fires to reach it.His fellow mercenaries were emboldened by Zavius' daring move and also quickened their advance, shields raised as they charged towards the walls, a thunderous cry of war rumbling throughout, though they were slowed down a bit by the walls of fire, forcing them to funnel in through a few points where the fires did not yet rage. Meanwhile, Zavius threw his grappling hook up, quickly finding purchase between one of the wooden stakes that made up the palisade. With a strong tug, the grappling hook's spikes were thoroughly embedded in the wood and he began to climb up, the speed at which the man scaled the wall unnatural.Soon the dark warrior made it up and over the wall, sword in hand and staring down several children and six Zephyr\u00a0men on what was now his\u00a0section of the wall. The children hesitated, but the soldiers quickly charged him, hoping to overwhelm him since he had made it up the wall much sooner than his comrades. The Zephyr\u00a0men knew naught what they were dealing with, however, for as fast as they came Zavius cut them down, his longsword slicing through their flesh and bone as easily as a knife through butter. The first man's lunge - sidestepped, before his sword arm was severed at the elbow and he was finished off via decapitation. The next man - stabbed through the heart, Zavius' longsword puncturing his gambeson easily.\u00a0Every man that stepped up to Zavius soon thereafter was dead in an instant until only the last of the six stood there, and then he began to run away further down the platform before also falling to a crossbow bolt through the neck, the shot being fired from a crossbow Zavius picked up from one of the slain Zephyr men. With no soldiers left on that section, the children and their mothers didn't try and fight Zavius as they had just witnessed him effortlessly kill six men by himself, their blood coloring his blade and armor a crimson red.\u00a0Crossbow in one hand, longsword in the other, Zavius would begin walking down the length of the palisade platform towards the gate under a constant hail of arrows while being continuously assailed by various Zephyr troops trying to stop him. Their efforts were in vain as no matter how many attacked Zavius at once still they could not overwhelm him.Blade in hand, he began slicing through the Zephyr men in a blur of flashing steel, blood, and severed limbs, his longsword akin to a scythe cutting through a ripe harvest. The casual air with which Zavius cut down these men could be likened to such a menial task easily as the Zephyr men might as well have been fields of wheat with how helpless they were before the onslaught of Zavius and his blade.Twenty or so enemies later, now having caused quite a bit of havoc on the wall Zavius would find a brief respite. He would take this brief opportunity to grab several\u00a0left over pots of oil and throw them down at a group of Zephyr men below crowding close together down below climb up the ladders and onto the platform where Zavius stood, dousing them in oil. Ducking to avoid a crossbow bolt shot from the men below, he loaded his crossbow with a flame-tipped bolt before aiming it downwards. Many of the men had already begun to try and retreat once they were doused in oil, yet it was too late. Their screams of agony filled the air as they burned no doubt a rallying cry for the Rondi men. Zavius would jump down a bit further down the defenses now amidst the chaos of many men who were burning alive running around like headless chickens trying to douse the flames. He killed a few who ran into his path before prowling towards the gate, his goal being to open it from the inside.The mercenary band that Zavius had been with were just now climbing up onto the mostly cleared section of the defenses, the whole sequence Zavius had completed only taking about a minute.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The mercenary band would advance, Zavius was near the front of the formation of the group.

The Rondi men had seemed truly committed, as even when he glanced around he realized he hadn't made much of a difference choosing to fight. Indeed, it seemed nearly all of them had followed suite, and he was caught up in the flow of marching bodies once more. Staring up at the palisade, his scarred visage taking in the sight. The round faces of children peered down at them terrified eyes seeming almost magnified as they stared up at the wooden behemoth that separated them. Then, terrified and pale glared down at them. As if it were them that had forced their children to fight. As the duke called out his orders, and they began their charge, Ash followed, yanking his blade free of its sheath with one hand. He wasn't quite sure how to use a sword very well, but he knew which side was sharp enough to inflict damage.\u00a0Then, came the arrows. Ducking down instinctively he heard a gurgling cry from the Rondi behind him that hadn't been quick enough to do the same. That could have been him. That would have been him. He was no stranger to danger, but even so the blood pumped through him as he lunged to the side as men began to shout and collapse, tripping each other up. Breaking from the larger body and losing the anonymity that had kept him from being individually targeted he made his way for the archer that had begun releasing covering fire. Just in time, it seemed, as the contents of the broken pots erupted into a blaze, and many men at the front of the assault were carried by momentum into it with screams and burning flesh.Taking his place with the archers he unslung his crossbow, already armed and ready as he pointed it at the faces who peered down at them in fear and hate. Leveling his bow he squeezed an eye shut, gasping a few breaths as his aim swayed visibly. No, no, even a little error here meant it bolt would be miles off its mark. Sucking in a few breaths he managed to steady himself. He had to loose it...but...as he swept his aim over the wooden walls every time he stopped he saw another terrified little face. The children. There were so many, mixed in with the Rondi golds and the blood-stained crimsons.\u00a0He could recognize the mercenaries from here, one of which was tearing through men as if they were parchment. He hadn't even loosed his shot yet and this man was already on the walls. His eye was drawn to a man who had knocked an arrow, aiming it down at a large group of Rondi men, close to where the Duke stood. Whipping his aim towards him he pressed the triggering mechanism, loosing the bolt.\u00a0Horror gripped his chest as one of the children, having broken formation and fled, stepped between he and his target. The world slowed as he watched the bolt slide along the wooden frame of the crossbow, at last loosed. He reached out, as if he could possibly be fast enough to catch it, but the instant it cleared the wood, it was gone. Time resumed its speed and, even in the distance, he saw the boy's head jerk at an unnatural angle, dropping out of sight. The man who'd aimed, however, leapt aside, forgoing his shot as he realized his position was not secure. Ash's blue eyes were wide in disbelief, the momentarily steady aim of his crossbow now completely undone as his hands trembled so furiously.\u00a0He lowered it, staring at the spot he had fired without reloading until a Rondi archer grabbed his arm, yelling something in their language which in his feeble understanding meant something along the lines of \"Keep [something], keep [something]\" Keep? Keep what? The man pointed at his crossbow and his brain, addled with shock began to slowly catch on. Keep shooting. Before Ash could even look up he felt the warm splatter of blood spill across his face, his eyes protected by the helmet. The man before him gasped pathetically, spittle and blood raining down on his face as the arrow jutted out of the man's throat.

Wine - and the company of the fine lady he was staying with tonight - had meant he was sleeping late today. It had been like a restless dreams him hearing the shouting and yelling outside accompanied by many hard steps. But this time it was right outside the apartment he was staying in - and those knocks sounded more like they were going bang the door in than asking for sugar.\"Heey Monik... Ehhr... Franceska baby, I'm trying to sleep get them to go away!\" Conrad complained but heard no answer and reluctantly got up and put on his underwear and a pair of slippers. To the sound of the knocking he then lazily dragged himself to the door leading to the living room seeing his girl from last night flat against the wall with a frying pan in her hands and a look of dread. Her lips mimicking 'Rond\u00ed' without a sound. At the same time a final kick blasted the door open and Conrad quickly snapped back behind the wall. A quick scream was stifled by a sound akin to a bag of potatoes hitting them floor and Conrad was suddenly wide awake - his heart pounding wildly. 'I don't want to die, I don't want to die' were the thoughts that went through his head as his hand nervously found his jacket draped over the dresser to his left. He heard steps outside - two legs - coming closer to his room. 'If they killed her, then they'll kill me! Oh my god what am I going to do?!?' Conrad thought. His fingers touched the the hilt of the dagger he was always carrying. It was never meant as a weapon and had never cut anything but apples - but was a good prop for a quick story of adventure at the local tavern. Conrad awaited the demon sticking his murderous face inside - surely there was no chance he could survive against some trained soldier? Conrad clenched his dagger harder his knuckles turning white and heart beating furiously as he pressed himself closer towards the wall. 'There!' his mind screamed as the the soldier's visage just beside him were no longer a mere shadow. But Conrad couldn't move as fear had taken hold of him - but the soldier didn't look around the room. Rather he took two steps towards the double bed Conrad had just gotten out of a minute ago and leaned over supporting his hands on the mattress. A few moments passed and a gulping sound came from the soldier - 'why is he puking?' Conrad asked himself confused about what was happening right now.A few seconds felt like ages as the soldier breathed heavily before straightening up again - but as he turned back Conrad's body had already moved and with both hands tightly clenching the hilt he had plunged his dagger in between the soldier's breast armor and helmet, the shocked soldier tumbling down on the ground beside the bed along with Conrad pressed on top of him. It was quick and violently - and he had no words for what he had just done. Killing another person - even if he was a killer himself was as far form Conrad's personality as it could be. Now again he heard it. The heavy steps, the yelling, the screaming... And it was coming closer no doubt, the other apartments had been broken into too. Conrad looked at the dead Rond\u00ed soldier. 'You've worn a mask before, why not an armor. You can be a soldier, Conrad. It's the only way.' were the words in his mind. Not words that that seemingly came from himself - they seemed foreign yet unmistakingly clear. He had been wearing an armor before when he was fifteen. A school play where his uncle lend him a real armor so he knew how to get it on and off. The dead soldier was like a mattress to him. A thing that was no longer a human being. They were about the same height though the armor was definitely made for someone bulkier than himself and the sword for someone with a stronger arm - this were no huge problem though. But he could never have imagined the terrible stench of blood when he put on the helmet which caused him to almost puke too.\"I can... If I can just get outside, I can slip unseen through the main gate..!\" he said to himself - a blissfully naive thought but having a plan it kept Conrad from succumbing to fear. Just some plan. Conrad froze though before he made it to the door seeing his lover the last night laying there in a pool of blood. Conrad forced his gaze towards the door and took one step at a time before he was outside the apartment. Several other soldiers had been breaking into the nearby apartments, but Conrad had only one thing in his mind. 'Get out!' there was the voice again. He made it down the stairs passing a few Rond\u00ed soldier but his helmet protecting him from instant recognition. He was visibly a touch paler then the average Rond\u00ed guy and the blue eyes didn't help either.On step more and he was outside! Conrad got out into the noise and shouting but didn't even get to gaze towards the gate before a group of rushing men came towards him. He had no chance but to press on further into the city for now - deeper into the mayhem and chaos. It was now that Conrad noticed the bodies all over the place. So many dead, so awfully many dead.

This was a slaughter, there was no question of it, and the only way to survive was to join. He couldn't revel in it, like others, he couldn't find enough hate in his heart to do such a thing, but he knew what he had to survive. As a poisoned woman screamed, covered in spores as she charged at one of the mercenaries he brought his bow up mechanically, a bolt piercing her unarmored body and forcing her to crumple to the floor out of his view. Then, they were ordered to march through the gate. The orcs, twisted sub-humans as they were, proved to be an effective, if not disconcerting force in battle to him, and he kept a close eye on them, although fortunately they rode much further ahead. Good. Orc corpses looked much better than Rondi ones, after all. Being part of the main force he only had a vague idea of what the other branches would be doing, something that didn't bother him too terribly much. He had his own problems to deal with, after all. Taking to the streets soon after the heavily-armored cavalry, his role had become painfully clear: Extermination. The sent of rotting, foul meat wafted over them, the blood and bile of dozens, maybe even hundreds of decaying corpses. Stepping over them proved difficult, but he was naturally light on his feet, and not heavily armored. The main force was being dealt with: It was up to them to clear the remnants. As a Rondi man stopped at a nearby door, struggling with it, it suddenly burst open and a man, covered in swirling poison leapt upon him like an animal. Another followed out, glancing at the two who struggled on the ground and shakily wielding a woodsman's axe. Then he spotted Ash. With a crazed look of panic and desperation he hefted the weapon, eyes glinting with madness borne of fear. Reaching for his sword, Ash found...nothing. Memories flashed through his mind of dropping it in an attempt to get to the archer force. Cursing his foolishness he reached behind him, under his cloak and pulled free the stiletto. Glancing at his \"battlefield\" he strafed slightly, putting one of the dead cows between he and his soon-to-be assailant. He knew enough about corpses. He could only hope the other man didn't. With a yell the man charged, realizing that with superior reach he could likely end the fight before it began. He raised a foot, expecting to simply vault over the corpse of the creature only to find no purchase. Instead his foot set upon the soggy flesh, compressing it more like a semi-liquid mass of mud than the solid flesh he had been expecting and he stumbled due to his overcompensation. That was all the opportunity needed as Ash simply stepped forward, closing the distance as he buried his dagger into the back of the man's skull, stepping on the wooden haft of the axe as he kicked him aside, letting the flailing corpse lie there writhing as it stared at him in hate, blood flowing too quickly to allow anything more hateful than a few choking cries. Reaching down and yanking the axe from the dirt, Ash glanced at the poisoned man, crying out in pain, battering the dying Rondi beneath him. They were both dead. They hadn't realized it yet, in their throes, but to any onlooker it was clear as the spores covered both of them. Stepping over in a daze, he grasped the axe in both hands and, raising it he brought it down hard enough to bury into the back of the attackers neck, the wedge not sharp enough to cleanly behead the man. As the Rondi man below gasped for breath, staring up at him with glassy, failing eyes, Ash dropped the axe beside him, walking away to complete his grisly mission.

As the orcs broke through the gates, charging into the city with a thunderous cry Zavius slipped away, slipping between two buildings into a nearby street as the defenders preoccupied themselves with the main force. As he did so, the sound of the fighting dimmed almost as if he had slipped underwater, the dark alleyway giving him a momentary reprieve. Even in this rather calm alley-way, however, bodies still littered the cobbled street in varying states of decay. The scent was so strong it was almost palpable and flies swarmed in hordes, their constant buzzing maddening. It was then that he heard it, the hushed voices in a building nearby... Zavius turned to face the building, the dark warrior a picture of death - the blood of Zephyy\u00a0men, women, and children staining the proud symbol of honor and chivalry\u00a0that was Rondon's emblem. There was a flicker of movement in the window, a flash of white as a curtain quickly closed, and that was all Zavius needed.He raised his bloodstained\u00a0blade slightly, approaching front door of the apartment-like building nestled in that alleyway, the sound of hushed voices growing more desperate and crying falling upon his ears soon.The door creaked open then, and a woman stepped out. She wore a plain white dress, her skin light, and her eyes a light blue. Her hair, long and chestnut\u00a0brown quivered as did her body in fear, her trembling hands clenching a clay pot. She said nothing as she stared at Zavius, her eyes wide and filled with fear. Slowly, she raised the clay pot and Zavius raised his crossbow wordlessly, pointing it at the woman.\u00a0In that moment she suddenly sprung into action, crying fiercely\u00a0as she steeled herself... yet before the clay pot left her hand a crossbow bolt sprouted from her chest, right over her heart. Zavius fired without remorse his aim as steady as it would be shooting at a straw filled target. The woman's trembling stopped, as she slowly sank to her knees, blood staining her pure white dress as it flowed. She seemed to try to say something as she died, sputtering as blood filled her lungs, \"Please...\" she uttered at last, her grip loosening on the clay pot now as she fell to the ground.\u00a0The clay pot rolled to a stop just outside the door, still hanging open. As Zavius lowered his crossbow a fierce shout could be heard from within, charging out of the darkness a boy, no older than eleven or twelve. Filled with rage at seeing the death of his mother he charged, making a break for the clay pot to throw it at Zavius. Yet even he would find no mercy, as the dark warrior drew a dagger and threw it, the blade embedding itself in the young boys' neck. The boy fell as the blade hit him in the neck, hitting the ground with a thud as he fell next to his dead mother. He managed to turn over, gurgling on his own blood as his hands feebly reached for the dagger in his neck before they fell to his side and he made no sound, his eyes, the same color as his mother's losing their light as he joined her staring upwards towards the sky lifelessly for eternity.All fell silent then... except for a sound from the darkness within the house - the sound of a little voice sobbing. Wordlessly, Zavius walked closer crouching down and peering into the darkened room. He knew he should have felt something, yet even then he felt nothing - but he remembered a time when he could. (Music)He pulled the blade from the boy's throat, cleaning off the blade before replacing it in its sheath and before continuing on.\u00a0", "link_list": ["https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF3DCa4TbD0"], "image_list": [], "html": "Zavius had decided to continue on into the city on his own.

Fire and smoke was everywhere and the only things the clouds didn't conceal were the screams. The horrible screams of the civilians the Rond\u00ed army was apparently slaughtering mercilessly. A slightly cough started manifesting and even as Conrad moved out of the smoke cloud and found a relatively fresh spot of air his cough wouldn't subside easily. It was... as if something was stuck in his throat and was just growing bigger every minute and he was soon drenched in sweat inside the heavy armor he was wearing. Out of the smoke though came a woman. A civilian it seemed carrying an urn in her arms. Conrad looked at her and was about to tell her to come with him - or hide... Running around in the streets would definitely get her killed... But before he realized that she would see him as the enemy, the empty urn had hit him square in the face and Conrad fell backwards and down on the ground. Before he noticed what had happened, the women was already battering him with a some kind of home made club. Conrad tried to protect his head by stretching out his arms before him, but found that though the armor did prevent her from immediately causing grave damage on his body, the continuing barrage of strikes rang through the metal and would no doubt leave large bruises anyway. Coupled with the poisonous smoke that had gotten into his airways, Conrad almost lost himself dreaming back to last night when he had been playing the drums and eyeing that sweet girl Franceska. The beating sounds were almost similar Conrad thought having now lowered his guard completely ready to hand himself over to whatever fate a you man like him would meet in the afterlife. \"SMACK!\" a crunching sound followed, though this was definitely not something akin to armor being struck - but Conrad didn't feel it, though the sound awoke him from his slumber. A man was standing above him. Rond\u00ed clearly, as he was wearing the same armor his Conrad and a blood soaked mace. \"Come on! You can't lie around here, we are ordered to vacate this damn city!\" he said and swung Conrad's arm over his shoulder, supporting most of Conrad's weight. Conrad threw up a bit inside the helmet, but he didn't care anymore. He could hardly breathe anymore and was exhausted in a way he had never felt before.

Only a few feet left!But fate seemed to want to play tricks with Conrad, and his staunch Rond\u00ed savior suddenly released his hold on Conrad and let him drop to the ground - before he himself dropped on top of Conrad with an arrow protruding from his back. The fall had Conrad landing his back and his helmet oddly twisted to the side allowing little to no vision as he lay there with the weight of the dead Rond\u00ed soldier pushing the last remaining air out of Conrad's lungs. And what more his arms were squeezed in beneath the Rond\u00ed soldier and he couldn't raise them up to signal the passing Rond\u00ed soldiers for help. Instead all he could do was try to hang on, trying to breath - if only just a litte - as he wriggled his legs and head hoped that someone would come and pick him up before everyone had left the city.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The next few minutes were absolutely chaos to Conrad as he was halfway lodged in between the Rond\u00ed soldiers as they ravaged the city. Fire and smoke was everywhere and the only things the clouds didn't conceal were the screams. The horrible screams of the civilians the Rond\u00ed army was apparently slaughtering mercilessly. A slightly cough started manifesting and even as Conrad moved out of the smoke cloud and found a relatively fresh spot of air his cough wouldn't subside easily. It was... as if something was stuck in his throat and was just growing bigger every minute and he was soon drenched in sweat inside the heavy armor he was wearing.

He had no desire to stay, or to slaughter any more of these people, nor did he wish to tempt fate with the thick clouds of wafting poison that insidiously crept through the air as if the wraiths of Dreigh were wreaking their final, deadly vengeance upon their attackers. Having secured the scarf over his face at the initial scent of corpses, Ash found himself more fortunate than most, as Rondi soldiers around him began vomiting blood and more solid things he dared not scrutinize with any meaningful eye. Even now he felt the rattling, thick feeling of mucus or worse rattling his lungs and he beat a hasty retreat. Having stripped off some of the heavier armor of the Rondi footsoldiers from his own body to more closely resemble one of their archers he found himself able to pick nimbly through the corpses, trying to ignore the throes of pain many still tossed about in. Passing the mass of corpses, men women and beast alike, he turned once as a door burst open and fired a bolt squarely into a would-be-attacker's chest. His reflexes seemed to be faster than his mind, as he was already replacing the bolt by the time he had realized it to be a woman of only fifteen winters. Biting his lip, hard enough to taste the bitter copper of blood he finished reloading, once more on his way. As an arrow sailed overhead he dropped to the ground, coming face-to-face with the corpse of a man, his face twisted into terror. The arrow hadn't been meant for him, but the next one might well be. Rolling onto his back it took him only an instant to locate the archer perched atop a nearby building. He raised his crossbow, sending a bolt into the man's throat as he began to knock his next arrow. Getting to his feet Ash glanced towards his target, seeing a downed Rondi man and, shaking his head, started once more across the courtyard of corpses towards escape. That was, until he heard the sounds of a struggle. Having not taken the time to reload his crossbow he whipped out his stiletto, glancing towards the sound. It must be the death throes of the Rondi man no doubt. Yet, on closer observation he saw a foot kick slightly up. Glancing around for signs of ambush he quickly closed the distance and saw, beneath the corpse of the dead man, @conrad. He was dressed in Rondi gear and Ash, no Rondi himself, could hardly identify him. Reaching down he grabbed the shoulder of the dead man and with his better position rolled him off of the unfortunate bard. Grabbing the helmet he pulled it off the man's head, tossing it aside to prevent it from obscuring his view. \"Archer's dead.
