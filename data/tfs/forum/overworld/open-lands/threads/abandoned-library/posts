Their journey was long and perilous, involving sea voyages, dangerous hawks, and a long battle on a rickety old bridge that culminated in the total destruction of a village of mice. After they arrived at the castle, they found that it was run by a bluejay king, who demanded that they find the seven pigeons find the mythical Redberry Tree and bring back a Redberry Seed before they would be allowed to take refuge in the castle. After weeks of searching, they realized that the Redberry Tree had never existed, and that the king had sold them out to the cats in order to secure his own safety in the castle.

As Edwin looked over the books, he'd see that they were all written in the same careful script. Oddly enough, none of them seemed to show any signs of age. They clearly weren't fresh and newly-written, but none of them were particularly old or decrepit either. Not a single one bore any illustrations or indications of who might have written them. Each contained an a fictitious story that Edwin had never seen or heard of, beautifully written enough to nearly draw The Historian into the world of the story.

It was obvious that she'd changed, she was not the woman he remembered, the woman he'd thought he'd loved. Of course, what was love to a man like him? He still wasn't sure, it was so hard to tell what was a truly valid emotion and what was just him trying to be normal. To not be broken. Still, she was in pain that much was clear and he felt that he owed it to her to at least try and ease that pain even if he wasn't sure he had the words.\"I am a monster.\" He says simply, beginning without giving her a chance to reply. \"I've killed children. Plural. More than that, I learned recently that I killed children that might as well have been my siblings.\" The way he says this is matter of fact, he wasn't looking for sympathy. Reaching into his pocket he pulls out the ring she'd returned to him. \"You said that you kept this ring on you to remind you of what you lived for. I do not know why you left, why you didn't stay in touch, I only know you came back.\"Alden pauses and frowns. \"Too many people tell me what I did was not my fault for me to believe that if I told you, you shouldn't have tried to live for me that you would accept that.\" He shrugs. \"Although that is true, I am not sure I am worthy of love although I've been lucky enough to find people willing to try loving me. What I will say as I know how it feels to not want to continue living. I know how it feels to be confronted with something so utterly painful that you are awash in despair and want nothing more than to die.\"He remembers the first time he'd felt that way. Laying on top of a village's worth of graves in an empty town in the mountains, knowing that every body in the ground was there because of him because he was nothing but a monster. With a sigh, he settles the ring on the table in front of him and comes to his feet. \"It hurts now. I think it will hurt for a long time yet. But if you give up the pain doesn't stop, it just hurts other people. If you keep moving though you may find something else worth living for. Something better, something that is yours and yours alone that no one can take away from you.\" For him that had been his children, they'd stopped him from ending his life when he'd learned what he'd done during his training before he'd even been the monster known as Wrath.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"You did.\""}, "post-89075": {"user": "Thaelyn Mortris", "user_num": 1770, "timestamp": "1549339721000", "message": "Although she was silent as he began to speak, it might not be obvious that Thaelyn was listening to him, as she continued to apply the bandage to her body.

And as she took a long pull of it, she finally looked at him again, her eyes dark and empty.

She gripped the neck of the bottle more tightly and pulled it back toward her as she settled in her chair again, her eyes flashing with anger and pain for all of a heartbeat. Then it was gone again.\"Nice little speech, I'll give you that. Not sure why you're here, though. It was easy enough to replace me, I didn't think it would be hard for you to concede to my request to be left alone. I'm not part of your life anymore, Alden.
