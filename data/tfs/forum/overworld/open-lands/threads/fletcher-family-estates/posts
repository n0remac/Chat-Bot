White-haired children play in the gardens, or run around the lands, while serfs work the fields. The serfs, like all good serfs, pay their taxes and rent by giving a share of the crops to the Fletchers. The manor is on top of a hill, with the farms extending from the base of the hill. Corn fields are to the east, south, and west, and strawberry fields are to the north. There are always people walking around outside the manor: guards, family members, and staff. There are ten full-time guards on duty, as well as a whopping forty members of staff.

Your body radiates its own natural heat. When you show love for plants, they grow faster. When you show love for people, they heal faster and live longer.

These are essentially very weak forms of lightning, fire, earth, light, and dark magic, and we can all do them.\"When she had finished her diagram, she laid them out on the table to the side and placed her hand over them.

It turned out most of the Fletcher family had a knack for earth and fire, so Jun would focus on that. Every person had their own personality too, and each of them wanted to learn a different spell.Granny herself would learn how to perform a basic earth spell. \"You've got to feel the energy through your body, but mostly in your feet. You've got to feel it rising through your body...\" Jun talked her through various exercises, many of which were surprisingly physical. Variously stretches and slow moving poses to help her feel the earth energy within her. The kids would join in in addition to their own tutoring time. As time went on, Granny became more and more proficient at feeling earth energy. \"Now you just have to turn it into something useful.\" Visualization exercises, various hand movements, breathing exercises. Jun felt like she was in charge of a classroom.As it turned out, the Fletcher family didn't have much of a mana pool, which was unfortunate. However, Jun had ways of creating more mana through the use of certain minerals and plants. Jun even contemplating teaching them how to use their own blood as a power source, but decided against it, seeing as it was a tactic best used for dark magic anyways.At the end of the first week, with a little bit of help, from an external mana source (or Jun herself) they could move rocks and stones around and even fling them rather hard.Still, this was taking longer than she had thought...The next week...\"The more you practice, the more your mana pools will increase. Just try to use your time wisely. Like your physical stamina, your earth energy has limits too...\"She smiled. Granny was now able to produce a basic defensive wall with dirt and rock.The kids were learning even faster. Each casting took several tries, and occasionally Jun had to lend some of her mana to her students from her own body, but with each session the number of successful casts increased. It was like watching someone ride a bike, and with each session they fell down less and less...The walls themselves were getting stronger too. Jun would test them by firing a mild psionic blast at them. At first they could scarcely ward off the equivalent of a human punch, but eventually they became capable of stopping a wild bull charge or the strike of a great hammer. Some of the kids weren't that good at making walls, but they could hurl rocks pretty damn hard, all the way up to the boulder range (Jun found this out the hard way with a blow to the stomach; luckily she was ok).\"Now let's try fire.\"A few days later...It was essentially the same process. First they would have to learn how to feel fire energy. More attention was focused on the breath and one's inner warmth. She pointed out that it helped to visualize the air as tiny particles, and that creating heat energy was a matter of making those particles move fast enough. Fire was the ultimate manifestation of excitement and energy in matter. In a way it was a very happy force, a playful force, perhaps an angry, zealous force, different from the steadfast, quiet strength of the earth.It wasn't long before the kids were producing sparks. Sadly Granny had not made much progress, so instead focused on earth magic.

My name became etched into stories and stones. Everyone knew the name of Rowena Fletcher. It wasn't just me, mind you. It was all my younger siblings as well. All nine of them. And my fourteen cousins. But I was the oldest, so I got the glory. In any case, that went on for quite some time, until I decided to get married and settle down. And so I did. I met a nice man, we bought a little cottage, and had a couple of children.\"She sighs, rubbing her face.\"Never marry an alchemist. The dammned fool blew himself up trying to manufacture cheese from beans. The kids and I were fine, but what were we to do? We need money. I left the children with their aunt for a little while, then went back adventuring. Eventually, I met another man, with another high-risk lifestyle. An elvish boat captain. Well, he eventually got lost at sea, but not before giving me another child. This went on for some time, you understand. I'd go adventuring, then settle down with a man who would invariably die from some dramatic explosion or something. I couldn't help it, boring men were...well, boring. But I eventually decided, after having 9 children from 6 fathers, that enough was enough. I set out alone to provide for my family, and boy did I strike it big. I singlehandedly cleared out an entire mine of goblins, and got all the gold and diamonds inside. With the money from that, I set up the family estate. All the lands, the serfs, and the manor. That mine still has gold in it, you know. It's still being dug out, as we speak. And it continues to provide more than enough for me and my family.\"Smiling, she strokes the ridiculously enormous sword.\"This was my weapon. I carried it for decades. In all the little cottages for all those years, I would never hang it on the wall. Partly because it would have broken the wall, but mostly because I knew that I was going to have to pick it up again sooner or later.

This dagger is quite unique, if I say so myself. One of my most prized objects from my collection. It is said that the bone, dragon's bone as it were, is made from one of the greatest dragons to have ever lived.

The coins it spawns then will duplicate in kind. You can keep it, but I suggest you wear gloves. See, this is a bit of a trick used by dragons in old times.

He pulled one of the\u00a0delightful fruits from its stem on a bush. The strawberries weren't his, but no one would miss just one right? There were rows and rows of the plants and more delicious fruits than even he could eat. It was alright, he thought. He held the fruit out in front of him in both hands, almost having to hug the giant berry as he wandered looking for a place to eat his pilfered prize.The pixie extended his bug-like brown wings, and beat them against the air quickly. He got a bit of altitude, perhaps a few feet, and was able to finally see the house in the middle of the sprawling estate that he had wandered on to. He might have flown in for a closer look (and to eat the strawberry), but something else caught his eye; something that was not like the rest of the healthy green, brown, and yellow. Flying a bit closer, it was clear there had been a fire amongst the corn.\"What a shame!

He turned away from his meal, and bent down to put his hand on the earth. He patted it gently as one might pet a dog or a cat, and\u00a0then moved his hand around in a little circle on the soil's surface. He beat his wings again, and a tiny bit of brown dirt fell from them, and drifted to the\u00a0ground slowly.
