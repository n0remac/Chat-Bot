A terrible orange-red gash appears in space, hovering a few inches off of the ground. Fetid, burning gas and air pours from the portal, blanketing the surrounding area in a thick miasma of a most infernal disposition.Yet a few moments later, forms begin to emerge from the portal. Twisted half-humanoid, half-canine beasts spill out in droves, running around the surrounding area. Their orange, glowing eyes search, scanning every conceivable nook and cranny for any sign of intruders, noses checking every scent and trace for past or present foes. A moment later the pack of creatures still, one emitting a shrill roar directed toward the portal. The portal pulses as if replying, and another pair of creatures emerge from it; vast, almost gigantic hounds, step from the portal, pacing around it and growling at the pack-members assembled before them. The canid-humanoids bow their heads in submission, wordlessly communicating their progress to their overlords. The two hounds sniff, and take up stances beside the portal.And then; he comes.The massive figure of Lord Rivadis, Father of Hellhounds and Lord of the Fourth Ring of the Hells, steps out from the portal, footsteps thudding against the ground. He looks over his assembled children, gaze sweeping over the dismal, abandoned forest grounds around them. Rivadis grunts.\"Meh. Mortal worlds. So colorless and bland.\" He raises a hand, snapping his fingers. A small flame appears in his palm. \"Lay the circle foundations and bring what we need here,\" he says in a distracted tone. \"I'm going to go for a walk.\"Rivadis begins slowly ambling forward, flame in his hand growing brighter. The two larger hellhounds follow behind at a short distance, the rest of the pack resuming their movements. They run about, clearing small amounts of ground. A few of the creatures dive into the portal and emerge with large bags, beginning to lay lines of white mineral salts in seemingly random configurations around the area.Rivadis strides forward, walking up a small hill (his sheer size uprooting nearby trees and greenery), his twin guard-hounds following behind.

A second later, the flame erupts into a massive wall of fire, sweeping over the immediate forest area. The creatures at the portal cringe slightly but are unaffected, as the fire licks through everything else. Trees burn and topple, water dries up and evaporates, and the ground itself bakes and burns as the fire spreads through it.Still smiling, Rivadis walks back to the place where the portal is, waving at the canid creatures. \"Very good. The foundation is laid, and all that is missing is the catalyst.\" He turns his head, orange eyes sweeping over the seared grounds. \"Very good indeed.\"Where before laid rotted trees and despondent ground, with a sprinkling of minerals, now a large symmetric circle of sorts can be seen. The crystals (previously ignited by the fires) still smoulder, their white color traded for a burnt orange-black hue instead.
