It is a sturdy and well-built locale with a solid foundation, oak frame, stone walls, and tiled roof.  To its right is a stable, housing the patrons\u2019 loyal mounts, and tended to by a young stableboy.  On its left is a well, which the innkeeper and his workers use as a source of freshwater.  Opposite the inn are the ruins of what was once a forge.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Should one enter through the doors they would be met with the sweet and savory smell of roasted meat and fresh mead.  A central hearth provides warmth and a means to cook.  Tables of various shapes and sizes, complete with mismatched chairs, are spread around the room.  At the back, however, is a wooden counter, where stands the innkeeper, Dalus.  The young girls who scurry back and forth from patron to patron, and hearth to table, are his daughters.\u00a0 There are private rooms for rent up above, and a cellar for Dalus' use below.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Adventurers from far and wide find respite at the Crossroads.  Some only need a place to rest and recuperate in the middle of their quest while others are looking for opportunity to begin their journey.  Heroes and outlaws, both old and new, speak of great or dastardly deeds; damsels recount the story of their rescue; bards sing tales of legendary figures from ages past.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Welcome to the Crossroads, traveler!  We hope you enjoy your stay!", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.pinimg.com/originals/67/2a/af/672aaf6ab312f81090caff983087ba42.jpg"], "html": "<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>"}, "post-87684": {"user": "The Game Master", "user_num": 3284, "timestamp": "1544570868000", "message": "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201c...and all you have to do is compare-\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNumbers?  Are you trying to teach me math, fool?  This is supposed to be a game?  This must be some kind of joke!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Game Master closed his eyes and sighed; another futile attempt to explain the mechanics of his card game.  His participant scoffed, shoved the cards back towards him, and left the table to rejoin his drinking buddies.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWell played,\u201d GM mocked the man, but under his breath so a scuffle did not come his way.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taking the loose cards spread across the table, GM stacked them neatly and fanned them out.  Most of them were made by himself - while others were templates he had given to willing participants, who filled out the necessary information.  It detailed the names of well-known figures, soldiers, monsters, locations, and events, each complete with statistics which were compared while playing the game.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was a work in progress, much like his other projects.  Those projects were stored in a suitcase in his room upstairs, but he decided to focus on his card game for the moment.  He needed some time to let his frustration wear off, and so shuffled his deck for the time being, hoping another willing participant would show up.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>"}}
