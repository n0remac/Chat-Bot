Some of the town folk from her village had joined their journey, along with, perhaps, some of his men if they chose to come. For a month, maybe two, they broke away from their homeland, and then it became much too dangerous for Cerridwyn to keep traveling. Their journey would end temporarily and they would take the hospitality of a middle aged couple in a cottage. The rest of the folk would set up camp in the surrounding woods, establishing a payment system of sorts to the couple in return for their generosity. There was always meat and game to be had, and plenty of wild vegetables and fruits harvested and shared with the folks, not just on their behalf, but on behalf of their mistress to whom they were loyal.Cerri was very swollen with child, her belly so big that people wondered if there was a giant one in there or if she was just big in general. The woman who owned the cottage, would not let Cerri sleep anywhere but inside and clucked about her like a mother hen. It was much to risky for a pregnant woman to sleep outside, especially when the weather was subject to change.At last, the time came for her to be eased of her burden... Adrian was shut out of the room where Cerri was ensconced because men tended to hinder the process. For three days and two nights, she suffered in the pain of contractions without results... But then, some time in the third night, when the first crickets of spring were chirping in content of a somewhat, warm night, Cerri's cries of pain were replaced with the cry of a baby. A daughter was placed into her arms, fresh and pink, and as perfect as she could be! Oh, how joy filled the new mother who cried with relief that the babe was alright! And then Adrian would be let in to meet his new babe after she was cleaned up and presentable.Cerri looked a hot mess, but there was that glow of motherhood about her, and her now, quiet bundle was gently rocked in her arms. Assuming he came in, she looked up and gave an exhausted smile with a tired sounding, \"Hello...\" Despite the mess, the sight was rather beautiful, and Cerri's eyes were filled with love for her little family, even if they had not yet wed. She watched him for his reaction, and then offered, reluctantly of course, their daughter. \"She is beautiful, is she not, my love? I have never seen anything so beautiful and perfect. I love her so... I would name her Terra if you would let me.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The road had been a long one for Cerridwyn and Adrian, who fled from the war torn Vessia to find a better life for themselves.

They swore to guard Cerri and Adrian until such a time as they found safe refuge.  Even then the Knight-Brothers remained in Adrian's service, setting up a temporary camp just near the cottage.  There they mingled with Cerri's townsfolk, often assisting them in various services and protecting them from ne'er-do-wells.Adrian himself, stressed as he had been, at least found a moment of peace here at the cottage - far away from Witch Hunters, Pagans, and Crusades.  But now the waiting started to agitate him.  He was so ready, so anxious to see his newborn that he could hardly contain it.  Cerri would find him pacing back and forth.  Often times he'd had to leave and check on his Brothers and Cerri's followers just to take his mind off of the ordeal.  He may have expressed a great deal of stress and anxiety, but it was very obvious the former Hochmeister of the Brotherhood was happy and excited.On the day Cerri was to ensconce Adrian was in the room with her.  He caressed her cheek and admired her beauty.  He rubbed her swollen belly and smiled, then leaned in to kiss her.  \"What did I do to deserve you?\" he asked playfully.  \"I'm afraid my only regret is that I can't be perfect for you like you are for me.\"The tender moment was soon interrupted as Cerri's contractions began.  The matriarcg of the household - pesky little hen she was - ran the former Hochmeister out of the room.  \"I'm going, I'm going!\"Adrian could hardly stand to hear the love of his life in pain.  He'd find himself barging into the room only to be ran out by the cottage's matriarch once again.  He felt compelled to soothe her and comfort his sweet Cerri, though he knew it would do no good.  All he could do was pray to Saint John.Adrian had nearly dozed off on the third night.  He had barely slept the past two nights, and even then only in a light daze.  He rubbed the sleep out of his eyes and endured the continued cries continued- wait, those were the cries of a child!Adrian busted into the room, eyes gleaming, looking around for the child.  He eagerly approached Cerri and his new daughter, coming down on one knee to place himself beside them.  He embraced Cerri and hugged the two of them tight, eyes watering.  \"Oh, Cerri, she's beautiful,\" he stammered.  He softly caressed the child's head.  It was a sweet and tender moment; Adrian had waited what felt like an eternity for this moment.  He was visibly animated both at the beauty of Cerri and his daughter.\"Terra,\" he would repeat tenderly.  \"Beautiful name for a beautiful girl.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "A few knights of the Brotherhood had opted to remain with Adrian, if not for friendship then at least for loyalty.

The woman who was helping her said to Adrian, \"I need to clean the lady up, and then once I show her how to feed the little one, I will leave the three of you alone for a time. Congratulations, m'lord, she is a fine babe.\"So it was thus. She was cleaned up, assuming Adrian held his daughter, and then she showed her how to feed, and was off after. Cerri was, again, holding Terra as she suckled, and was sleeping while she could... At one point, she opened her eyes and looked up at the man who was, for all intents and purposes her husband, even though they had yet to take their vows before a priest. A sleepy smile was on her face.\"Adrian...\" His name was a breath on her lips. She couldn't help but be emotional, feeling the pang and realizing that she was feeling insecure about their future... Where would they go? What would they do? It was quite a natural feeling to have right after giving birth. It became overwhelming, however, and she said, \"Where are we to go, my love?

Ultimately the man returned to Cerri, cradling Terra within his arms so she could see her.\"I... I don't know, Cerri,\" Adrian reluctantly said; he didn't like being indecisive - it was against his character - but it was the truth: he simply didn't know.  \"I... I was thinking Isra... or Aozora.\"  He remembered his time in Isra; at that time it was called the Free City, ruled by Ildesias; Hochmeister Konrad IV had sent him there as Komtur of the garrison, a duty he fulfilled well - even participating in the battle against Red Fletcher.  But he also remembered the Crim issue: when he and some other knights had become corrupted by a strange magic in the fortress of Crim; it took the efforts of Brother Hansel to free their minds.  \"Isra would be good,\" he said, \"perhaps... I have served the Israns before... though Naoki may not remember me in a kind light.  If not there, then Aozora: the people there are tolerant of all walks of life - and they would certainly accept us, I believe.\"Adrian nodded, \"yes, I think we should go to Aozora.\"  He sighed and looked at Cerri with a guilty expression.  \"I know it may not be what you want... but I must offer the Aozorans my services.  In exchange they may grant us land, an estate even.  Imagine, Cerri, a great, big home for you and Terra, beautiful gardens, servants, and more.  What do you think?\"Adrian assumed that, if he offered the Aozorans his martial leadership and experience, they may reward him with a plot of land and necessary supplies to build his family a home.\"And soon, my love, I shall take you as my wife.\"  He smiled, leaned over, and kissed Cerri on the lips.  \"And we'll be a happy family.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"Yes, yes,\" Adrian said eagerly, taking Terra into his arms and cradling her.
