He was careful, he was easily guided in his handiwork and footwork.But he could already feel his muscles protesting. He had only been at it for a little more than a quarter of an hour; he kept his breathing even and steady, his core tight, and his purpose focused. But even still, he was not doing as well as he knew he should.As he thrust the shortsword out with one hand, the blade lengthened with a thought, becoming the length of an arming sword. He flourished the weapon, spinning it behind his back and into a backhand grip, as his other hand flew forward; from it emerged a length of flaming magic, that sizzled and burned the air around it. He lashed it several times, before spinning on his heel and thrusting his hand forward. In that same instance, the whip straightened out into a spear.His satisfaction was stolen though, as it erupted into sparks that sizzled and sent pain through his hand and arm. He hissed not in pain but at the pain. Anger flushed through him at the failure. The loss of his own control over the innate powers that coursed through him. He flourished his sword as it shortened back to its original length, before sliding it into its scabbard on his back.The Dahloen lowered himself to the ground, sitting in the lotus position as he glared at nothing in particular, ignoring the birdsong that began to fill the air as his session ceased.He breathed out slowly before pulling his hood up over his head. He had cleaned his war stained robes, and cleaned off his armor as best as he could\u2026 but that end war had forever left its mark upon his equipment. And he could not allow himself to forget what had happened. He would never forget the death, the chaos, the screams that even now sometimes echoed in his mind when he was awake and haunted his dreams as he slept.He instead chose to observe the forest around him, to note the life with passing interest; there had been little enough of it by the time he was born that the absolute greenery was\u2026 disquieting to him. His homeland and the lands of the Ehloen he had fought in had not been barren per se. But it had not been like this.His finger plucked at a single blade of grass, and he clutched it in his hand, drawing the life from it to ease his fatigue. It was not much, but it was something. He tucked the now dry piece of foliage into one of his pouches. There was no reason for it. No need for it, but he wanted it. Maybe the life of this world held properties that he could draw from to make new potions and poisons.He couldn't remain at the ranch forever, after all.He took a deep breath through his nose and leaned back on his hands, closing his eyes as he stretched his legs out in front of him. He could enjoy the gentle sunlight that escaped between the leaves, let it play about his blue-gray skin. But he kept his ears open.Even here, in these docile lands, everything was unknown to him; beast, ally, friend, and enemy.

He flexed his fingers as Leandros' power coursed, forcing him to tense his arm to bring back the surge.
