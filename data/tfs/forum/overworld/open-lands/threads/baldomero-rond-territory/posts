In truth, the strong resemblance shared by the women of the Rashmi family went a lot deeper than their blue eyes, black hair, and shared facial features. It was easy to assign responsibility or to call out the behavior of any of them, because they all participated enthusiastically.There were styles and degrees, of course, but it was more or less ubiquitous. And since she had become a mother herself, Zenia had decided it really probably was mostly her own mother\u2019s fault. Looking back from the perspective of a woman trying to raise her own children, it had become clear that every accusation of Layla spoiling them and letting them run wild was not only entirely justified, they were mostly understatements.But the simple fact was that Layla adored children, and her endless patience for teaching them, playing with them, taking care of them, and generally being around them had been a godsend. If the price of being able to take a break, have a bath, eat a meal in peace, or even just get some sleep finally was letting Layla spoil the children, Zenia would call it a bargain every time.", "link_list": ["/user/2425"], "image_list": [], "html": "Zenia laughed softly at "}, "post-71252": {"user": "Layla Rashmi", "user_num": 2423, "timestamp": "1501784823000", "message": "Apparently, she had been listening more closely that it appeared, because Layla leaned over, picking up a cushion from one of the unoccupied chairs, and flung it at her daughters. \u201cHey!

At that thought, her dark eyes welled up slightly with tears of mixed joy and sadness.The glance lingered until it properly could be called an inspection. Olina was most obviously present in Edmund Rashmi   , of course. He had taken after her in so many ways. He had her dark skin, and deep, soulful eyes. Her tendency to sit, wordless and motionless, for long periods, so much so that the wild animals of the fields and forests treat him as a part of the terrain. And when he smiled, Layla could see her again there, too. The twins looked like Layla, of course, but she could see Olina in them as well. In their mannerisms and body language. The small motions of their hands as they spoke, the way they tilted their heads just so to listen. They had all inherited Olina\u2019s love of the wild places. They had grown up deep in the wilds, and she had taught them all she knew of woodcraft, of forest and stream, of plant and herb and birds and beast and everything else. For all that they appeared perfectly civilized, Layla knew that any of her children could comfortably live on their own in the wilderness for as long as they cared to. And no matter which womb had borne them, all three were as much Olina\u2019s children as her own.She sighed softly, then looked up to Circe again, giving her hand a gentle squeeze and pulling her down.
