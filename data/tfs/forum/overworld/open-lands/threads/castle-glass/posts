However, the guard's chest puffed up with pride as he spoke of it. He led her into the main keep and through a series of twisting hallways and complex corridors until they reached a large dining hall. Nodding in satisfaction that he'd successfully led her to her destination, he grinned weakly, showing a mouth not-quite-full of teeth.\"Would you like something to eat? To drink?

She walked toward the table surrounded by chairs, there was something about this room that made her feel uneasy, dizzy. She firmly held onto the back of one of the wooden chairs, practically leaning onto it. She felt a bit choked up, she could feel her veins pulsing inside her. It was as if she could feel her heart beating rapidly inside her head, although that was impossible. \"No, I do not require anything. I'll be okay.\" She spun back around to face the guard, giving him the warmest smile she could. There was a faint smell in the air, almost familiar? Or was it just the smell of the last meal that was eaten in this dining hall... She shook her head, for she couldn't figure out the smell. Maybe that's what was causing her to feel unnerved...?

He looked to be in his late forties or early fifties, but the years had not been kind. Stress lines creased his face, and his hair seemed to be turning prematurely grey. He glanced at Jesilyn, seemingly unimpressed by her appearance.\"So you're the latest newcomer coming to ask about the job, huh?
