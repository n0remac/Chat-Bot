The view of Fletcher, and the brazen beauty of a land untamed inspired the elderly Geneveieve, and with her magic, she made this beautiful home.It has 6 bedroom suites with walk in closets and bathing rooms and 4 traditional bedrooms, a library, a study, a dining room, a music salon attached to a ballroom, two sitting rooms, a sun room, a large cellar, a large kitchen, and a basement.Behind the home, called Deuxcoeurs Hall, is a sizeable lawn with a Gauldish garden for walking and viewing pleasure to its immediate right and framed around the back, where the cotton fields could be seen in the distance. To the left of the lawn is the hall's personal garden and greenhouse, filled with vegetables and herbs and the plants necessary to make the eyes Genevieve uses on her clothes.Near the manor in their own buildings is a handsome stable and barn, as well as a small smithy and carpentry.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/VmdyzVu.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/VmdyzVu.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/>"}, "post-55730": {"user": "Lady Genevieve St. James", "user_num": 875, "timestamp": "1478634358000", "message": "When the time arrived for the agreed-upon dinner with Monsieur von der Gilleman, the plantation was made warm with lamp light, inviting and approachable.Lady Genevieve was settled in the front parlor, and she waited patiently for Leonid von der Gilleman to arrive.
