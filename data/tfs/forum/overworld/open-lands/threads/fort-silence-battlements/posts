Carrying food, iron and weapons and all heading towards the same location only a few hours travel away. Fort Silence. As he walked through the main road towards the fort. Falcon could see lumber jacks and woodsmen setting up deadly traps amongst the trees. Wood falls, spiked pits and hidden bear traps were only some of the quite imaginative construction going on around him, as men in leather armour wielded pikes, watching over the roads and the construction. \u201cMove along! Spoke one of the militia guards to the convoy of traders and caravaners. \u201cStay on the paths! Do not deviate from the assigned routes. Do not stop moving!\u201d The flow of traffic slowly began to pick up as more paths started to converge into one as they began to come closer to the Fort.

Mostly made of Iron wood barricades and spiked poles they where slow to build stemming from the hardness of the wood used but they were almost immovable once placed. The workers sweating and groaning in effort as the hammered, sawed and moved the various logs and planks into place. Past these initial defences more well-made wood log walls had been placed, nearly 8 meters high. With work crews digging great ditches in front of them. Having to use both shovels to move the earth, but also axes to cut through the roots that seemingly interlace the ground like a net. As Falcon passed this second layer of defence, he could see from these great walls\u2019 militia soldiers overlooking the throng, pointing at the odd traveller, a signal for a man on the ground to investigate. Either through luck or skill Falcon was able to pass through unmolested. It was there were Falcon was able to see the beginnings of the Fort proper, the entrance at least. A great staging parade ground could be seen as Falcon passed the wooden walls. A raised platform had been set up, with a young man directing the incoming crowd to separate into those with combat experience and those without and directing them to either a waiting area if they had no experience, or into the Fort if they did. Behind him a massive cave entrance could be seen. From this distance it seemed like a great maw devouring the small trickle of people entering it. It seemed too smooth of a cave to be of natural design, with a floor almost completely flat, and walls smooth as polished stone. Recessing into the surrounding cliff face by several dozen meters, the vague outline of a massive wooden gate could be seen at the far end of the cave.", "link_list": ["/post/91925/thread", "/user/3494"], "image_list": ["https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/intermediary/f/3e97fe51-263c-4b0f-a2a0-bd2787e37eae/d4gccxr-1c64832f-9994-4b33-bd70-9e23e6fecddc.jpg/v1/fill/w_600,h_686,q_70,strp/commission__r"], "html": "<div author=\"@thefalcon\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/91925/thread\" timestamp=\"1561991713\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-3494\" title=\"Falcon Cultain\"><img alt=\"Falcon Cultain Avatar\" src=\"https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/intermediary/f/3e97fe51-263c-4b0f-a2a0-bd2787e37eae/d4gccxr-1c64832f-9994-4b33-bd70-9e23e6fecddc.jpg/v1/fill/w_600,h_686,q_70,strp/commission__r\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/91925/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1561991713000\" title=\"Jul 1, 2019 6:35:13 GMT -8\">Jul 1, 2019 6:35:13 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-3494 group-0\" href=\"/user/3494\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@thefalcon\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Falcon Cultain</span></a></span> said:</div>Falcon wore his traveler's garb more frequently than his usual ornate outfit due to the hardship involved in crossing the landscape on foot, and found himself rather grateful at the present moment for his foresight.

A steady stream of refugee's and volunteers were sharing the road with the small band of Isran soldiers, all of whom gave Analiese plenty of space. Following the gentle incline towards the entrance to the fort, Hael would notice the work of several small woodsmen teams laying various traps among the dense undergrowth of the tree's. Most were made to maim and frighten rather to kill out right, with bear traps, pit falls and dead falls the main variants currently under construction.\u00a0Once the great mountain cliff face was in view, the terrain began to change. A clearing had been made by felling a large section of the foliage, no little effort considering the lengths it took to fell the Ironwoods of the valley.

It had taken everything to keep the steely composure she was known for as the memories came flooding back. Memories which wrenched the broken words from her tongue, locking them firmly within her chest, below a tight throat. Memories that made her Tala the Silent. Flashes of her shackled hands grasping at bloody locks of strawberry blonde attached to a frail husk. The sound of shattering ceramic pulled the woman from the vision. She looked down to see a pot smashed to shards and her own clenched fist bleeding over it. Tala brandished coin for the damage and quickly made her way out.\u00a0As Tala rode the white and black speckled steed through the encampment, something began to swell in her chest, although she could not place the feeling, figuring it was merely an adrenaline rush over what was to come. Deep inside she knew it was something more.\u00a0Tala had an intimate history with the Silent Militia; their relationship went back nearly a decade. Their mountain had gone to war with bandits, thieves, rogues.... slavers, and lost a terrible loss. Their freedom pulled out right from under them when they couldn't even conceive the prospect of war after having known peace for so long. The hard labor, and other unspeakable things. The world had been so innocent before that; so entirely possible. Tala had been working through that lie ever since, and although it looked like she walked strong and tall, the ranger had become a shell of her former self. She owed the militia her freedom. For it was them that came when all hope was lost.\u00a0Could they do what the rangers couldn't in the mountains? Tala was willing to bet her life on seeing if it was possible. She took it all in the trenches, and traps; the villagers and former slaves learning how to use weapons for the first time. It seemed many were coming to the Fort's aid, and still she wondered if that would be enough.\u00a0The woman put it on herself to help as much as she could. Teaching people how to craft and use basic weapons, such as bows and spears. She noticed some of them would stare at the more experienced warriors training and try to mimic their actions; she reacted by having them partner up and practice the experience of being charged in combat, but became impatient with their progress. Did they not realize they were all in the brink of re-enslavement and possible death? Tala gathered them all into a circle and stood at the center of it, and requested for a volunteer.\u00a0\"The objective here is to try and kill me,\" she said, \"as I am going to try and kill you. Am I understood?\" Tala blinked as she received nothing but a frantic nod. \"UNDERSTOOD?!\" The shout made the volunteer jump as they squeaked out a pathetic, \"Yes!\" She sighed, unused to having to get ugly with simple civilians. Tala faced real foes in combat on a regular basis. How could she help them understand that hesitation would get them killed instantly in the heat of battle?\u00a0They might as well try and get used to the feeling, she thought. \"Now,\" Tala drew a large wooden practice sword she had carved herself to model the real sword she carried, \"Come at me.\"\u00a0The volunteer braced themselves, drawing up as much courage from the adrenaline as they could muster, and charged.\u00a0Tala stepped to the side, yanked the weapon from his hands, and swept their shin with her foot, causing them to trip and fall in the mud facefirst. \"Dead.\" Blue eyes cooly scanned the trainees as she snapped the weapon in half with her knee and tossed the two pieces aside.\u00a0\"Next?\"\u00a0It happened almost exactly the same, again, and again, and again. So much so that Tala felt she could die of boredom alone.\u00a0 But then there was the one. Tala could tell from the look in their eye they had a bit more experience than the rest. It was a look that reminded her of herself. It was something they had seen, or something they had done, or both. She knew better than most that not all former slaves were helpless villagers of the valley. Some were hardened warriors. They clashed wooden swords, dancing in unison, testing each other with every move. It seemed they were evenly matched, until they knocked the weapon from her hand and her back hit the mud, leaving the trainees slack-jawed. They offered their hand to help her up, and she took it.\u00a0\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The Silent Ranger hadn't realized how unprepared she was to receive such news as the siege on Fort Silence.
