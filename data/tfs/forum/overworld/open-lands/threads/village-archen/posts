The lines on his face seemed to deepen, as though the mere thought of the tree caused him to age even further. The murmuring of the other villagers ceased abruptly as they listened, waiting in silence to hang onto his every word.\"That's a bad tree,\" he said. \"A Hangman's Oak, as I'm sure you know. Do you know anything about Hangman's Oaks, lad? They're grown over witch's graves. They say that it's not the hangman executing a criminal, but the tree. The tree has to like killing. If you ever try to tie a noose to the hanging limb and it breaks, you'll know that the tree has had enough.\"He pointed up to the single outstretched limb, which stretched menacingly over Day's head. The limb was completely intact, aside from a slight divot that showed where the rope was usually tied.\"This tree still wants to kill. It thirsts for slaughter, and wants nothing more than to break every neck that dangles from that limb. However...two years ago we hung a druid. An awful man he was, mark my words. We had to slaughter our whole flock of goats because of what he'd done. The thing is...when we hung him, he refused a blindfold. He didn't look at the crowd, though. No, he stared right at the trunk of this tree. He cursed this tree with his dying breath, told it that it would never take another life. We didn't think much of the curse at the time, but it had power. He'd channeled his soul as it left his body, and left his mark on this tree.\"Shuddering, he leaned heavily on his stick once more. A young man ran out from the crowd to come to his side, steadying the old man and giving him a shoulder to lean on.\"The next man we tried to hang,\" continued the old man, \"was a murderer. Cut his poor wife to shreds with a butcher knife. My very own niece. Poor Talia, she never hurt a fly in her life...but we caught the bastard, dragged him out and strung him right up to the tree. The hangman kicked out the stool and the killer fell...but he didn't die. He just hung there, kicking and choking and turning purple as the rope dug into his neck. We let him hang from sunrise to sunset until we cut him down, but he just wouldn't die. The thing we brought down, though...it wasn't a man. It looked like one and talked like one, but it had changed. The tree couldn't kill, so it turned him into a monster. He's locked in the basement of the temple right now, still clawing at the walls and rattling his chain even though we haven't fed him in over a year.\"The townsfolk nodded fearfully, hands clutched protectively around small children as they listened to the tale. It was clear from their lack of shock that they all knew this story well, but they still turned white with terror at the old man's recount.\"You'd think we'd learn our lesson, lad, but you'd be wrong. We thought it was a fluke, didn't believe what we were seeing. After the same thing happened to the next two, though...we stopped hanging people from that tree. It only stands because there's not a soul among us brave enough to cut it down. Who knows what would happen to us, to the town?
