There was much damage done to the city, and many deaths, but months after the attack -- and after Queen Xiomara, Prince Rafael, and Princess Arenna were officially crowned within the city -- it is now being rebuilt and remodeled, with more effective acqueducts and a more Rond\u00ed touch to the building scape.The people there are full of tension, as both Zephyy and Rond\u00ed occupy the city. Crime is not rampant, for it is dealt with swift Rond\u00ed justice, and the war has not been kind to the Zephyy.

Rafael had never been to the once-small village, and during the war, the young man had commanded forces to the East. He'd only ever gotten as far as Vinicio, and had had no desire to travel the rest of Zephyr after.One day, of course, he would have to. One day, he would be King of Rond\u00f2n, and would be expected to not only step out from his mother's shadow, but to cast an even larger one by fanning the flames of Rond\u00f2n's victory higher and higher.It was he who had suggested to his mother that they push for Rond\u00ed ships to sail further. Now that they had so many, and that so many of the merchants were more than willing to call themselves Rond\u00ed if it meant coin and papers that legitimized their right to piracy, why not expand?It kept his mother's mind off of him... And off of Arenna. If she had been seriously hurt, their pendants would have said something. No, instead she was off sewing wild oats and Rafael had to remind himself not to be angry with her. Less than a year ago, he'd been the same.But war had changed him.He'd only ever known Duc Soult in passing, hardly had he said more than niceties to the man at the victory feast, but Rafael felt as if the man would have better advice for him than those that were too close to him... Or too much his senior.In the city of Vinicio, Prince Rafael had worn the clothes of his captain and put his signet ring on a chain hidden around his neck. He waited in the Broken Swan tavern, not exactly a dive but not the grandest in Vinicio either.He'd taken the liberty of ordering two ales, since he was sick of drinking Rond\u00ed wine, and hoped that the Duc would appear as...
