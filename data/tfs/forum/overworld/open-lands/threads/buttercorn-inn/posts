Despite himself, he is up at the crack of dawn when the rooster crows. He was not normally up so early after a hard night's work but he suspects that Emahra was the type to be up with the sun and he would not be left behind. Writing an original song about a famous lady could be his chance at entering the halls of legend. Like any bard writing, such a song was his dream and he would not give it up lightly. Thus Emahra would find him in the common room shortly after she arrived herself. The man immediately asking after a hearty breakfast. He felt sick but he knew that would pass and he would be grateful for a belly full of bacon, eggs, toast, and porridge before the day was done.
