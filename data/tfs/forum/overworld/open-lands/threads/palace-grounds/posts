Thick grasses, lush ponds, and a profusion of trees fill the lands around the palace, where the graceful nimuar of the High Priestess and the proud, fierce sokeli of the High Priest live.Located mostly outside, the entry hall is where all visitors are received. The Temple Guard will hold all visitors here until it can be deemed that they pose no threat, and here where servants will meet them to escort them to the High Priest and High Priestess. Most of the halls of the palace are open to the air and look out upon the palace grounds, a necessary feature in the warm, nearly tropical climate of Esdara.Private library of the High Priest and High Priestess, this sprawling three-story room with large windows and high arched ceilings is a favorite of both of the scions of Esdar. Filled with books that date back to Esdara's origins, many of its tomes are kept a closely guarded secret, their contents unknown to even the members of the Council of Winds.A blend of carefully planned flower beds and elegantly chaotic plants, the expansive palace gardens are lined with stone walkways and a number of fountains and fish ponds. A few stone gazebos filled with cushions and other comfortable furniture can be found in various places, providing comfort for those who walk through the greenery. This large area is also where the protected nimuar and sokeli reside, roaming freely throughout.In the heart of the palace is the throne room. This is the highest court in the realm. Here the High Priest and High Priestess hear the most important matters, and it is here where the High Priest lays his judgments upon cases deemed too high to be handled by only the Council of Winds. This is also where the High Priestess hears the most important entreaties of the people and where the two share the visions and law given to them by the god Esdar.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/KDQbVdm.jpg", "http://i.imgur.com/ruFAg3q.jpg", "http://i.imgur.com/griygT2.jpg", "http://i.imgur.com/lIsbO7z.jpg", "http://i.imgur.com/8dzkDuK.png"], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/KDQbVdm.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/></div>"}, "post-53839": {"user": "Hypern Cynic'al", "user_num": 1820, "timestamp": "1476785710000", "message": "Secluded in one of the Palaces many private training grounds, Hypern sits calmly within a whirlwind of leaves.
