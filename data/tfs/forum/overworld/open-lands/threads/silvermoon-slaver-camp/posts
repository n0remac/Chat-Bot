How...barbaric,\" replies the commander, holding the door to the warden's office open for Roxanne as the silver-clad guards usher her in. It's a squat stone building next to the grand citadel of the prison proper, but inside it's opulently decorated, forest green curtains laced with silver trim hanging upon each window, each wall decorated with what appear to be original art pieces, a grandiose mahogany desk sat in the centre of the room. Two bookshelves adorn one wall, filled with various tomes and novels. A disturbingly great many of them seem to explore the subject of torture techniques and how to most efficiently dispatch your enemies, along with several famed military doctrine manuals. The rest are leisure reading; a few even appear to be sappy romance novels. A sturdy oak door across from the book shelves marks the man's bedroom.\"We prefer to call them...mmm...contractors. They work for us, they get treated well, fed, clothed, bathed. What more could one ask? Certainly we make the monetary profit, but do we not deserve this, after all we do to keep our people alive?\" he asks as he sits upon a cushioned chair facing his desk, pushing aside a stack of building plans from the centre of his desk and tugging a set of bounty posters from a cabinet filled with files. He spreads them out on the desk before him. They give no description of the crimes of those pictured, and a few of them look to be no older than sixteen seasons.\"These insolent fools decided they would forgo my generous hospitality for a taste of...what they call freedom. The whole lot of them snuck out in the dead of night, leaving their comrades behind -- some allies they were. By now they are likely dead, eaten by the beasts that roam this forest or picked off by ruffians and bandits, but I want you to find whatever remains of them, and bring them to me.\"His soft tone has turned into a light growl, and his emerald eyes flash with anger. \"If they are dead, they will be displayed for all to see, to show those who might harbor similar thoughts that the Silvermoon Organisation is the safest place they could possibly be. If they are not...well, then they will scream for their insubordination for seven long nights, before they are silenced. Permanently,\" he purrs, sliding the painted posters closer to Roxanne.\"They are hardly worth this price, but I wish to make an example. I offer half a million crowns for the lot of them. You get a quarter of the reward upon acceptance, the rest will come when they are brought before me,\" he continues, leaning back in his chair and crossing his fingers, his enigmatic grin returning. The silver-clad guards stand behind the woman, \"I would recommend you don't take the quarter offered and leave, however. That would make the Silvermoon Organisation very...unhappy.\"--Meanwhile, outside the warden's quarters, a makeshift market is being set up, a large wooden podium upon which several dozen slaves are positioned, chained to the ground below them with heavy steel links, arms crossed behind each. A merchant's caravan trots into the camp, a troupe of well-dressed men lining up before the podium and speaking with one another with a low buzz. The slaves working in the mustering ground have all been ushered away; it's unbecoming for such worthless filth to be seen by the Cartel's customers. One by one slaves are tugged up onto their feet by a burly man who looks more like an executioner than a salesman. His voice tells a different story, however, a charismatic baritone that flows quickly and clearly.The merchants use painted fans raised into the air to place their bids, and one by one the slaves are pushed off the market podium. One in particular stands out among the crowd. It's a woman, but her curves are not supple and fattened or waifish and girlish like those who came before. Instead, her figure is powerful and taut. Her hips are wide and her breasts full, but her abdomen is toned and scarred by years of fighting, her legs and arms visibly powerful, the musculature bulging slightly without being grotesquely large. She's a prime physical specimen in every sense of the word. Her white hair cascades over her face as it drops, her eyes shut tight as she kneels, fighting the base urge to give in to impossible odds. She won't give these merchants a show -- despite being nearly nude and humiliated -- and she won't give in to the slavers' jeers. As the slaves get sold off one by one she awaits her turn. She will make them regret ever touching her.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"Those,\" replies the Commander, stopping for a moment before the great steel door that marks the entrance to his quarters and looking back over his shoulder at the hanged men with a grim expression, \"were once my finest officers.

She hated this place, hated that man, and hated herself for even considering the offer. It was deeply tempting, but there was no way she could ever forgive herself for something like that. She began to walk away from the office, heading past the market, when a flash of white hair caught her eye. Glancing over, she spotted a familiar figure and her breath caught in her throat. There was no way...but there she was. Roxanne couldn't believe her eyes. What was Raena doing here? What had these monsters done to her? Roxanne knew that the woman's pride must be killing\u00a0 her, that her cousin would be seething at being so exposed in front of all these people. How could they put her in chains like that, to be sold to the highest bidder? She stared at Raena, eyes wide with shock. The rags didn't hide much, and she could tell that the captors hadn't been kind. Raena had always been much fuller in the bosom than Roxanne, and the raw lash marks barely hidden by the scrap of cloth told her that Raena's \"blessings\" hadn't been to her advantage. How could anyone be so cruel? Roxanne clutched her arms around her chest, imagining if she were ever attacked like that. It would be awful, the humiliation almost worse than the pain...and now here Raena was, ready to be sold to some wealthy old lord to be used as little more than a toy and decoration. Roxanne hesitated for a moment, then hurried back into the office, face flushed.\"Commander, I...I have a counter offer. I'll bring you your runaways, alive or dead. No up-front payment, no half million. Instead...I want that white-haired woman that's being sold off right now.

They don't last long, however, as Raena overcomes her shock and stands up, pulling the chains up from where they disappear into the podium and whipping them about to catch the slave auctioneer's leg, tripping him up. She slams a foot down upon the man's chest, pinning him, and glowers down at him. The nearby guards move to intercept, but a subtle gesture from one of the faceless honour guards tells them to stand down.\"Try and auction me off to some rich bastard again,\" hisses Raena in her deep, feminine tones, \"and you will die choking on your own blood.\"She squats down to take the keys from the auctioneer's belt, unlocking herself and rolling her shoulders forward.

She wears the same grim resting expression as always, and although she looks a tad slimmer than before, she's still got a powerful angular facial structure. She pulls her flamberge from the cart and pulls it from its sheathe, prompting the guards to lean forward a tad, both hands moving to their heavy glaives, but she doesn't make any move to attack, instead swinging the gleaming blade through the air once, testing the enchanted blade's weight. Nodding in satisfaction, she sheathes it again and slings it over her back, followed by the shield, and then the gladius, which she attaches to her belt.

Of course she doesn't. Still, hunting down slaves feels...wrong, even to her. Death is preferable to being kept as a pet, in her mind. Death means being reunited with The Void and falling into eternal slumber. Slavery is constant humiliation, constant distance combat, constant severance from The Void.
