It was for this reason that he wasn\u2019t very sure how long it had been since he had left the quiet comfort of his hut deep in the heart of the Usque. Not terribly long, he surmised, but he already found his mind wandering back to it. In a way he missed it - the dense woods and small creatures around the hut he\u2019d made for himself had become very familiar - but, in another way, it was hard to be homesick when he was still well within the confines of the Usque. The same earth that his hut had sprang from was the same earth he could feel under his bare feet even now as he walked. His home was the forest, the Usque itself, and he couldn\u2019t feel homesick when he was already home.As night approached, Ogi\u2019s thoughts, like that of Tana and Yutin, came to rest on the idea of making camp; a place to bed down for the night. That was when a faint smell came to his nostrils. It was smoke. Wood burning no doubt for a campfire. Ogi hadn\u2019t expected anything with a mind for fire-making this deep in the forest. The terrain was hard in places, and he hadn\u2019t seen a permanent shelter since he\u2019d left his hut some number of days before. Curious, he followed his nose. It wouldn\u2019t be long before following the smell of burning wood turned into following the smell of food cooking, and finally turned into following the dim light of the campfire.Ogi approached the camp with caution. At a bit over 7-feet tall, Ogi walked hunched over like an ape. He had short legs, and steadied himself on his powerful tree-trunk-like arms that reached all the way to the ground. He was acutely aware that he could easily be misidentified as a monster, especially in the darkness, and sought not to rile the inhabitants of the camp. Despite his heavy frame and the lumbering gate of his walk, Ogi made very little noise until he was within earshot of the camp.\u201cHello!\u201d he said, his voice just a bit above normal speaking volume. \u201cI-yam Ogi! I wish to share your campfire!\u201d Ogi stayed just outside of the brightest part of the firelight, preferring to hear from the camp before he would continue in.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Ogi didn\u2019t keep track of time well, as he saw very little reason to count days, weeks, months, or even years.

The forest had a way of communicating with him that he didn\u2019t fully understand himself, other than he simply knew when he was needed.

The Usque had cradled him, nurtured him, protected him, and granted him power to heal what had been destroyed; and in return Ogi would heed its call.

Ogi moved further into the light, and approached. He stood up straight, lifting his knuckles off of the ground, and toddled on his short legs towards the pair. There were bigger creatures in the Usque, but it would be hard for a normal human not to feel dwarfed by the 7-foot tall ape-like creature that was Ogi. His broad shoulders and sheer mass of his body would make him appear to be a formidable foe, but his eyes did little to belie the gentle softness within him. He sat, and reached for the small pouch on his right side.\u201cI thank you for your hospitality, Yutin.\u201d He said, and opened his bag to reveal that it was full of small nuts, each one encased in a hard shell. \u201cPlease don\u2019t think me rude, but I will have to decline the generous offer of your stew there. I have plenty of nuts to go around, though, if you\u2019d like to have some.\u201d His voice was a quiet, smooth baritone, even if his words didn\u2019t flow very smoothly at times.Ogi held a few nuts in his hand as he watched Tana sign. He looked on, watching her intently. He didn\u2019t understand what she was trying to tell him, but he was fascinated watching the attempt. He quickly gathered that the woman was in some way verbally impaired \u2013 or at a minimum had decided not to speak.
