Harpies were monsters, ones that could snatch you from the ground you walked on and drop you to the earth below, more than a match for a Pleb with a chip on her shoulder. \"No one else would help us...no one else would avenge him.\" she chanted to herself as she walked, as though a cleric's mantra. Who would come up here to help the Plebs? The slaves? Sure, some \"heroes\" might come seeking gold or glory, but not for them. Never for them, and how many might die in that time? If nothing else, if she got torn to pieces or dashed upon the rocks, perhaps her actions may inspire others.

Hesitating at the crossroads the path had eventually terminated into, she glanced between the two directions she could go. While she lacked the experience to make an informed, tactical decision, getting picked up out of a hole sounded much better than getting picked up off the top of the mountain, didn't it? Presumably you'd start closer to the ground in the former. Steeling her resolve she picked her way down towards the outcroppings, using the butt of her pitchfork to help her navigate. Fortunately she was quite fit, and the difficult terrain didn't bother her too much.
