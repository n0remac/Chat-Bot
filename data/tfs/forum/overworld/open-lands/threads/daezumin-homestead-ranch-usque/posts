He let the small beast loose within the gate and watched him kick and run in excitement before latching the entry shut and heading inside.He had to rummage the kitchen a bit, trying to find something substantial that wouldn't take any time to prepare - he didn't want to make this poor human wait any longer than necessary for something more to eat. But thankfully she seemed to enjoy the bread he had on him before. He found the rest of the loaf in the breadbox and pulled the entire thing to slice it to pieces. The fireplace, a unique setting in his kitchen compared to most of humans well outside of Usque, still bore the roasted deer slabs on the stone plate across the crystal-lined \"fire\" pit from earlier that day and so he piled a few pieces onto a wooden plate with the bread. The fruit basket on the counter was still full of apples and a few pears he had found, and so he snatched up a couple of each to add to the pile.The serving plate was full by this point so he returned to the front porch and carefully set it down on the small side table by the seat. When she roused he gently tapped the corner of the plate with a soft smile. \"I'll find you something to drink,\" he spoke, just a tad slower than normal. It was strange trying to communicate with someone so different, and he didn't want to spook her again. Before disappearing back inside he brandished a plain but sharp knife from his belt and set it beside the plate, in case she needed it to cut the food. Now he was glad that he had steeped another jug of spring water with mint and berries yesterday, he thought as he found as he found the crystal pitcher and a pair of glasses.The pitcher was an odd thing, but beautifully cut. Embedded in the bottom of the glass base was a tiny crystal that stood up into the contents just a little bit, and before he sat it down on the same table he ran a thumb across it - and the small gem began to glow a soft ice blue that lit up the water. He placed all the glassware down and moved to grab a matching chair from along the porch so he could sit nearby. It was a nice day out, he noticed, and he was wasn't going to leave Amia alone.

He opened the unlocked door and would take them both down a short flight of stairs into a cellar where the walls were smooth stone yet the floor was a very intricate mosaic design in soft blues and whites - almost like gemstones. Along the walls there were crystals of various sizes, though none bigger than a hand, that seemed to begin to glow as they passed - as softly as the one from the pitcher but white rather than blue.

Sitting in the clean cut stone floors beneath the waters was a red crystal in the center of each.Against a nearby wall was a plain little table that held an small, open crate that was filled with a number of gemstones of soft, pastel colors that seemed to release gentle scents of flowers and earth and ocean into the room. Right beside the box was a short stack of folded, fluffy towels. There was also a similar plain chair across the room.\"I don't know if you are used to something like this,\" he chuckled lightly, stepping off to the side to move out of her way as to allow her into the room. After an awkward moment he nodded at the pools. \"The waters are warm from a spring somewhere under the house, but just tapping the gems with your foot will activate them and they will warm the water further. You can get a nice, hot bath.\" He turned his head and reached to the box of gems, prodding amongst them with a finger. \"All you have to do is drop one of these in the bath and you'll have bubbles in minutes.
