It waddled down from his body, towards the somewhat still flowing, still-warm blood, and settled itself.Immediately, a stream of data crashed into his head, detailing a 'sypnosis' of what animal the blood had come from. A healing slime had to know the biology of the creature it'd been healing lest it kill them, after all.Caron frowned, however, as more information about said creature detailed its appearance. That was... not a four-legged animal, said animal didn't have sharp teeth either, nor sharp claws; it stood up on two legs, however, and had an unnaturally big head, kinda like him, kinda him and someone else... Caron's\u00a0face twisted, eyebrow raised upwards in fear, no, worry, even his month old mind could make the connection. The only two two-legged, big-headed animals he knew of were master and himself, and that was blood on the ground, the thing animals excreted when they were dying. Had master come back for him? Had he perhaps befallen a terrible fate when looking for Caron?He burst into a sudden sprint, picking up his healing slime as he went, following the thick trail of red, running forth with speeds no boy his age should have the right to have.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Caron had wandered past the snow-covered trees, unfazed by the cold.

Cathedral Serachel was relatively new, and he knew it well. His heavy boots crunched in the snow, although it was getting warmer the higher elevation was still letting them enjoy a few inches. He could see out front, the group of people who had gathered around the gates. A boy, seated as Rester Farah spoke to him. Giving them a simple nod he passed by, stopping at the closed gates as Avery gaped at him. \"I have a wounded man here, do you intend to let me in?\" he asked calmly, and the mage quickly swung the gates open. Stepping past the entire conflict as the priests gaped at him he headed inside the Cathedral, taking Merryman Humour up to a more private study before laying him down on a fancy bed before heading to his heavy mahogany desk, penning something as he waited for the man to awaken.

At this moment, he'd seen Alured, rolling his head across to see the hulking black figure, writing something on his desk. He supposed that at this time, the man deserved his thanks.
