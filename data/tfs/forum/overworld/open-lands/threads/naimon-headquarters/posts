Still, there were many things to figure out, logistical problems as well as financial\u00a0ones, among other things. Starting your own mercenary company was hard work, as Rune found out, and the massive responsibilities he shouldered weighed heavily on him. Sometimes he missed the times when he only had to worry about whatever monster that was in front of him that needed slaying. Ever since the death of his father, however, Rune became the sole heir to the Naimon family, and he no longer had the luxury of slacking off and making nothing of himself. His aspirations were greater than serving at Fort Adamant, though, and looked towards growing his family's wealth and fame to new levels, thus he started the Naimon Company, a mercenary company established to take almost any contract.\u00a0His personal fortune, inherited from his father was massive but steadily draining and by his own calculations, most of it will be spent by the time the company is fully operational.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Rune walked through the clearing, that was set to be the future headquarters for the Naimon Company.
