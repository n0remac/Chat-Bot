Sweat began to seep through Felix\u2019s tunic in the midriff. Knees shook as his backpedaling feet were anchored in place by an unnatural compulsion. An expression of greed replaced fear as Felix took a step back towards the table. His hands clenched and released spasmodically, gaze locked onto Jun now. She was on one of his posters as well, but unlike Camilla she was not wanted alive.\u00a0As the frightened human was broken by a lust for wealth, so too did the enchantment that he unwittingly carried in his coin purse begin to sag. The spell hemorrhaged magic that began to physically manifest as a caustic smelling miasma.

The clinking of coin and strange presence nearby has him turn in his seat towards Felix, seeing him go through a weird possession or trance-like state.

She understood it to an extent because she had experienced something similar during her training. But there was something different. Jun had a universal connection with the magic in the air and most life forms around her. But the Usque was Camilla's place, Camilla's history. Jun was a friend of the forest, but Camilla was its\u00a0family. So after hesitating a few seconds, Jun decided the best thing to do was relax and let the former princess' bond with the forests restore her spirit.\"... You know,\" Jun's headed slowly rotated back towards Felix, and her voice was cold and deliberate. \"I may not be quite at full strength yet, but that doesn't mean I'll take kindly to being threatened.\" There was an ominous little crack as Jun's fingernail broke the wax seal of the scroll in her hand. There was also a faint build up magical energy coming from her throat.The air grew still. A lot of air grew still.

Instead, they were vines. Rapidly propagating plant material spilled out onto the table and started to grasp and entwine around the myriad of scrolls that had been laid there.

The vines expressed an odd sort of sentience in avoiding jostling any food or drink, and in fact leaving the table cleaner than it was before and smelling of fresh mint.Jun wearily shook her head and reached to pick up an end of the mat which conveniently formed a handle for herself. \"I was too lazy to just put them all away.\"There was still a scroll in her opposite hand, the one with the cracked seal.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Jun's stern countenance seemed to melt into red-faced weariness. \"S-s-see see see this is why she's the mature one in our friendship.\" It was as if she had taken the order not to fight as an imperial edict, but without the electric sizzle of being scolded by a parent.
