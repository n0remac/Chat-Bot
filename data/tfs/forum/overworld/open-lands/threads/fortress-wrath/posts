In fact, it may not be on the planet, but instead a portal to his little domain in Hell. Nobody really knows. Except\u00a0for Ira, but he isn't sharing the secret. The Fortress appeared as tensions between Isra and Goraia reached untenable levels, inevitably leading towards war. And war breeds wrath, as opposing soldiers are told to hate one another like they have no other,\u00a0A pair of stone gargoyles flank the causeway linking the earth below to his fortress. A fearsome pair they are, they go by the names Cain and Abel, and are the most loyal of all the Demonlord's servants. This is because they are created of his essence, infused into the very stones that make up the Fortress and granted life by the will of Ira. They will ask all who attempt to enter their reason for doing so, and if the answer does not satisfy them, they will attack \u00a0and drive off or kill whoever attempted to enter. Should they be bested, he will reconstruct them out of his own castle, there to greet the next guests, but those who bested them had better have a good reason for doing so, as that is a sure-fire\u00a0way to incur Ira's wrath.Those who are allowed in will make their way through a simple fortress, two straight hallways broken up by only one large meeting/dining hall that leads directly to the throne room. It is here that the Demonlord will receive those who come to him. Those who seek his boons will have to prove themselves if they haven't been summoned by him directly. Those who seek to challenge him will find no comfort, but should they prove themselves in the combat he may grant them mercy. Now that he has returned from Hell, he is seeking new heralds to incite and inspire wrath wherever they are sent, or choose to go. Those who prove themselves are rewarded with gifts from Ira's trove of treasures, collected over numerous\u00a0millennia\u00a0of existence. Those who wish to enter into his service are granted the right to become his Herald, spreading wrath over the lands at his discretion, and eventually, after being granted further and further daemonic abilities, become a daemon themselves.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://imgur.com/BOCs32B.jpg", "http://imgur.com/bNHNdPW.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://imgur.com/BOCs32B.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}, "post-53810": {"user": "Romelia Fletcher", "user_num": 1241, "timestamp": "1476747680000", "message": "The ship was gone.

She'd just forgotten in the face of... Fangs and... Evil. She cleared her throat and was about to speak again when her broom and hat were summoned from where ever they were...... And brought to the dining hall from where they had been fighting in Sugar Hollow. Ribbon ends were slapping at broom and hat like hands, and the items were whirling around. The hat threw the broom at the table and it smacked into the food, sending it spraying everywhere before the hat dove onto the broom and began to restle with it.Silverware clattered, entire platters clanged onto the floor, empty glasses shattered as the hat and broom brawled with each other.Wendy was speecless for a moment, splattered now in mud AND food, and then she shook her head and stood, slapping her hands on the table. \"That is enough!!\"The broom and the hat immediately went still, and then flew away from each other, hovering in the air and seemingly to look at Wendy. Then, one ribbon arm each pointed at the other, as if to say -- she started it!Wendy glared. \"I don't care WHICH of you started it, I'm finishing it.\"The broom and the hat began to shake and twitch, their ribbon arms gesturing wildly and Wendy crossed her arms. \"I don't want to hear it. Apologize to each other. Immediately!\"The hat and broom seemed defiant.\"Immediately!\" Wendy repeated.Both seemed to wilt and then turn reluctantly to each other. They held out hesitant ribbon arms, shook them quickly and retracted just as quickly. Wendy smiled.\"There now, was that so hard?\"The broom and hat turned away from each other. The broom subtly wiped its ribbon arm on its bristles, as if wiping away the hat's handshake while the hat used its ribbon hands to fix its lop-sided bow.Then... Wendy became aware of their audience, and the food fight mess in the hall. She blushed beneath the mud and blood on her face. \"We'll clean this up...\" she said with a nervous laugh.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "I have not taken your magic, even I cannot forcibly extract it from a living person without killing them."}, "post-63387": {"user": "Ira, Demonlord of Wrath", "user_num": 1880, "timestamp": "1492693743000", "message": "Fucking mages.

Of course it would be,\" Wendy spoke to herself, or perhaps to her broom and hat. She glanced down at the broom in her hand, and its ribbon-tail-arms gave her a thumbs up.

Her grimoire appeared, and she took it from the air to lay it on the ground, flipping through pages. Then, she summoned her pack to be near her -- as if it wasn't any trouble at all for her, and perhaps hinting that Wendy was rather modest with her magic ability -- and drew out chalk, candles, a skull, some candles, some herbs, and three little packets of dust.Leaning forward on her hands and knees (and her skirt riding up the back of her thighs, showing teasing hints of her thigh-highs and garters and the lovely tattoo on one thigh), she sketched out a large pentagram with runic symboles by each point, in between, and at the center. She laid out the the herbs along the intersecting lines of the star, and put the skull at the center, placing the candles at each starpoint. Sitting back on her heels (and thus hiding that flirtatious view), she rummaged in her sack for matches and found she couldn't find any.\"Oooof course I don't,\" she groaned, then twisted a bit around to look at Cain and Abel -- who had apparently been looking at her the entire time. \"Sorry to bother, really sorry, but have you got a light?\" This was a realm of fire and heat, but that didn't mean her candles might suddenly burst to flame.
