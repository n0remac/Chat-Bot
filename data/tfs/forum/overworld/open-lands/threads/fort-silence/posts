Almost unrecognisable from a distance it was only recently rediscovered after an ill-fated convoy of villages sought refuge from roving slavers. Now it is the home of the Silent Militia and their families who protect and administer the Valley and its inhabitants. Residing mostly underground, dug deep into the dark granite stone it is a labyrinth of corridors and quarters. The entrance to the Fort lies several meters deep inside a large cave in the side of the mountain range. Although the cave looks naturally formed, the floor has been worn smooth and flat by constant use from ages past. The ceiling, several meters high, lets in a slow trickle of water which causes the cave to be constantly moist and wet. A small market place has begun to appear at the entrance to the cave network as merchants and traders buy and sell their goods collected from the surrounding valley settlements, protected from bandits by the ever-present watch of the Silent Militia.Mason\u2019s BayThe main town, Mason\u2019s Bay, doubles as the safest route into the valley via the Quiet River, where the water is as flat and undisturbed that it seems to be almost like glass. A fishing village at heart, before its liberation is served as the Slavers set of power, with several wharves jutting from the small town to harbour slave ships as they moved out towards the open ocean. It has recently seen a revival with the appearance of Isran Trade Ships bringing coin and goods in exchange for the famous Ironwood logs of the valley. Forest HillA small lumber village to the north it resides in the shadow of Mount Kaleth. Home to just over a dozen souls, almost all of them involved in cutting and processing of the Ironwood trees, with new money being fed slowly into the valley, many of the dilapidated buildings are gaining much needed renovations. SwitchBack ValleyA farming village it was the main source of food of the valley outside of the fish caught from the Quite river. Frequently raided by bandits for the precious grain the inhabitants are few and the farms in dire need of revitalization.

Its dark stone and empty halls less inviting then a grave. Now with the help of Tallarn as an intermediary, work was being done to resurrect these halls. The several cattle brought along were stored in the stable area, along with the solitary horse. There was not much food for them, and the ground harsh stone. So, a farm hand, only nine years of age, decided to take a sword looted from the now defunct camp, and cut down grass from the surrounding forest. Now these animals had food to eat and bedding to rest on. More than could be said for the adults and children. The haphazard camp raised by the now dead refugees was broken up. The items redistributed to the living. Backpacks, food, rope or even some personal effects were given to those most in need. But it was not enough. The new inhabitant were tired and malnourished. Their time as slaves breaking their bodies almost as much as their souls. The feeling of safety was quickly being replaced with hunger and tiredness. Although there was what seemed rudimentary kitchens deep inside the halls, there was nothing to fuel these hearths. A few of the women had brought iron pots or skillets, mostly items that they have recovered from the stores left at the bandit camp but there was nothing of substance to cook. There were not enough beds either. The old campsite contained five travel blankets for its original occupants, no more. The nights were cold here, the stone floor even more so. So Kargth decided what must be done. The small crowd huddled around the campfire at the entrance to the cave. All that remained now of the original campsite. Kargth spoke to the boy Tallarn, who was now acting as his voice to the crowd, as Kargth\u2019s gasp of their language was still rudimentary at best. \u201cAsk them who knows how to\u2026\u201d Kargth struggled with the word. \u201cMake beds from\u2026trees\u201d \u201cDo you mean carpentry?\u201d Tallarn replied, squinting his eyes up at Kargth, he was only hip height at best to the knight, and Tallarn was not a small child. \u201cI think so. Make chairs and\u2026tables of\u2026 wood.\u201d Kargth said trying to describe what he was thinking. \u201cThat\u2019s carpentry alright,\u201d Tallarn said, nodding his head. Addressing the crowd now, Tallarn raised his voice, not that he needed to much. Everyone was hanging on to every word spoke by Kargth, even when he was conversing with the boy. \u201cDoes anyone here know any carpentry?\u201d The boy asked. Some of the women looked at each other, one or two raised their hands. One spoke. \u201cA little bit, I had to fix a few tables and my bed last winter after a storm. I think I can do it.\u201d \u201cIt will\u2026have to do.\u201d Kargth said. Now addressing the crowd personally. \u201cI will cut\u2026down some\u2026trees. You will\u2026make beds for us. Others will make\u2026\u201d He looked at the boy for help, trying to gesture. \u201cLashings\u201d the boy said after a bit of interpretation. \u201cLashings\u201d confirmed Kargth. Noting to remember that word. \u201cOthers will make\u2026fire wood. Or look for food in\u2026the forest. Do not\u2026go far.\u201dAt this, the group broke off to their tasks. Kargth selected a large iron axe that had been collected with the rest of the spoils left in a pile with the rest of the weapons. And went outside to begin his work. Some of the women and children also dispersed into the forest, searching for forage or animal tracks. There was enough food already to last a few days at most with severe rationing, but Kargth did not like the chances. Walking a few metres out of the cave into the dense forest. Kargth chose a smaller tree, almost a sapling compared to the ginormous tree\u2019s around him several so high he could not see their canopy. He readied himself at its base and began to swing. Great chunks were being taken out of the tree\u2019s stump. The axe digging deep into the wood. With only a half dozen swings the tree began to snap and fell with a crash. Kargth began to break it apart, separating branches from logs and twigs from branches and began to haul it back to the camp. Dragging it along the ground behind him. Back at the camp, the two carpenter women had already instructed other women on how to create lashings. And when Kargth arrived, quickly came to cut up the wood into smaller parts to be used for their tasks. In under three hours, five basic cots had been made, at the expense of three small trees. It was near midday now, the sun directly over the cave, it was hot outside, but refreshingly cool inside. A blessing and a curse it would seem. After bringing in a fourth tree and letting the women cut down this one to create the next set of cots, he directed another three women into the tunnels, lighting the torches he had place in their cupolas as he went. He led them to the nearest kitchen space and directed them to begin lighting the hearth and prepare it for food that will soon arrive from the foraging parties. It took a few minutes for the sticks and twigs to light, but eventually a hearth was made, the smoke and ash billowing up smoke holes in the ceiling, leading to some exit point on the surface. When Kargth once again reached the surface, he saw that another cot was almost completed, as well as the first set of foragers returning with berries and roots of plants. Once again, he led them into the tunnels, showing them a large room near the kitchen space where the women inside were beginning to prepare pots and pans for cooking, becoming familiar with the strange stone stove system. In the room Kargth was showing them the food was to be stored for easy access to the kitchens, as well as to stay cool and dry. One final time he rose from the darkness of the tunnels, the dust on the floors now swirling in the air, kicked up by feet and loot. Kargth walked back into the forest to collect another tree, by the time he returned a system had begun to appear. One of the carpenter women was commanding the cot construction, showing three other others how to lash or tie the knots needed. The children were ferrying tinder and small branches to feed the kitchen and Tallarn was directing the foraging parties to rooms to store their bounty. Eventually even the looted items were separated and stored haphazardly in separate rooms. Weapons were separated from tools; food was being separated by spoilage. It was beginning to be cohesive. By night fall, enough cots had been made for everyone, as well as a few rudimentary tables and benches for the kitchens to work with. They all ate in the kitchen, the stored rations eaten with nuts and berries from the forest. Kargth watched on as they ate. Eating as fast as they could, every morsel, this was probably the best meal they\u2019ve had in a long while Kargth noted. A few tried to give him food to eat, but Kargth declined. He had no mouth to eat with. No intestines to digest food or drink. The smell was still delicious, but he had no want to consume it. Once the last crumb had been eaten. Kargth addressed one more the crowd of two dozen. Now looking much better fed, but even more tired. \u201cYou have\u2026done well today.\u201d Kargth began. \u201cThis place\u2026has become more alive\u2026 then it has in a long\u2026time. You have come with me\u2026 without knowing me. You gave me\u2026 your trust. This is my\u2026home. I welcome you to it. \u201cHe spread out his arms, gesturing to the room around him. \u201c You may stay here\u2026 as long as you wish. If you do\u2026 I expect you to\u2026help. No meal is free here. Also\u2026 there will be no\u2026stealing.\u201d Kargth placed his hand on the holstered hilt of his sword. \u201cOr you will meet the same\u2026fate as your\u2026captures. All will do\u2026their part.\u201d Some of the women nodded at this, others gave each other strange glances. One woman spoke up, one of the forage party. \u201cSir, this place is safe, it is luxurious compared to where I live. Could we.\u201d Her head lowered. \u201cBring our families here? Some of us had husbands that still live back home. Children that we miss dearly. I did not live far from here; I was taken while finding herbs for my child\u2019s illness. I miss him dearly; they probably think I left them.\u201d She was near sobbing. Another woman put her arm around her, consoling her.Kargth thought for a moment. More manpower will be needed to defend this place it is true, once word of the bandit deaths spreads. Others will come looking, either for revenge or to steal what we had taken. \u201cVery well.\u201d Kargth said. \u201cYou may bring your families.\u201d A few of the woman started shouting and smiling at this news. \u201cBut,\u201d Kargth raised a gauntleted finger \u201cWe will have to do it \u2026 village by village in \u2026 parties. This place is still not \u2026safe. Bandits \u2026 still roam these lands. We shall\u2026visit the first village\u2026in the morning. For now,\u2026rest.\u201d So, they did. Curling up on their cots and make shift blankets. Kargth was pleased. He did not know why, but he felt like he was doing what he needed to do. Kargth began to walk back towards the entrance to the cave. The corridors were warm now, the fire from the kitchen warming the air and the floors to a comfortable temperature. Picking up his axe once more, Kargth headed back into the forest to cut down more trees, to make ready for their new occupants. It seemed Kargth had found something to do when others slept.

It was not enough Kargth knew. Soon the bandit numbers would thin, the slavers will change their routes, the current system was only a temporary solution. Already the raiders had begun to come back with less loot, less coin, less food. Soon there would be no way to feed the hungry masses, the forest unable to provide with just game and berries. Although a clearing had been made outside the fort, as people cut down the great trees to be used for firewood or furnishing and the like. It was would not be nearly large enough to begin to grow food, and the planting season already passed. So it was decided that they would begin convoy\u2019s of their own to nearby villages, trading protection and the loot they had taken from the bandits in return for food and other items they could not build themselves. It would take time, but Kargth was sure they would survive the winter, he would regardless, he thought, a dark chuckle rising from within him. He had no need to eat, and he did not seem to be affected by heat or cold. Those he had saved though, those he had brought back into the living. Not as much.

The great ironwood tree\u2019s grew dozens of metres into the canopy above, shielding the forest floor in a constant twilight. This made travel through off tracks extremely slow moving and dangerous. Root systems sprung and dove into the ground like tangled string. Feet and equipment can be easily snagged or tripped without careful watch. It was in the perpetual shade of one of these trees, snug tight in between great roots leading to the base of an iron wood that Kargth had tasked the camp to be set. Two dozen militiamen were preparing the camp for the night. This was their fourth raid this month and many were now becoming experienced in efficient camp skills. Tents were setup and hidden amongst the groves and roots, fire pits were dug and lit and sentry positions made and posted in now little under forty minutes. Kargth was impressed, just over a month ago many of these people would have cut themselves on trying to grasp a sword, now they were beginning to show real potential. Steady meals and purpose can do wonders for the psyche. The gear that the peasants turned warriors wore was still haphazard, but slowly less so. At least they were being cared for to a decent level now. The black smith back at the fort had been working tireless to buff out or scrape off rust spots and dints. The raiding parties were separated into two clear groups, the Vanguard and the Main force. There were 8 Vanguard troops in this raid, wearing dark leather armour smeared in mud and dirt and sported bows or short swords. Their mains goals were to locate enemy positions, remove forward sentry locations silently and sow discord when the attack had begun. The main force, which counted for the remaining sixteen wore combinations of chainmail or plate armour and wielded pikes, long swords and shields. It was a system that had worked before on other bandit strong holds and showed no signs of stopping now. \u201cAre your men ready?\u201d Kargth asked to a woman in plate armour and carried a sword and shield. She was of medium height with short blond hair and an angular tanned face. Her name was Cyrene Rel, before her second life she had been a slave, captured when her home was pillaged, and her husband and children burned three years ago. She spoke little of what happened after. Her face was slashed with scars that spoke louder than she ever could about what those dark years had done to her. \u201cYes, Commander.\u201d She replied, watching the others as they began to unfurl cloths for sleeping and preparing meals. \u201cThe men are ready for tomorrow. Baylar still has a slight limp from the arrow wound to his thigh from last time, but he should be fine as a rear guard.\u201d \u201cStill can\u2019t believe he got shot in the ass!\u201d Yelled a man nearby gleefully, now leaning over the fire with a small iron pot, stirring a broth. \u201cShut up Tel!\u201d Sounded another, within one of the small A frame tents. Baylar it seemed. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my ass; it was my thigh!\u201d \u201cAnyway, Commander.\u201d Cyrene said, with a slight smirk on her scarred face. \u201cThe men are ready as ever. We\u2019re expecting about thirty men from what the scouts have reported. All on foot, most are carrying bows or short swords. Highway men from what it sounds like. Their hide out is dug into a small boulder outcrop, so it was hard to get a correct count. They think no one knows they\u2019re there, so were not expecting too many sentries, nor for them to expect company. Should be a slaughter.\u201d She said those last few words with relish. She wanted to kill them, Kargth was seeing it in a few of the others, the same look in their eyes. They wanted revenge, to give pain to those that had given them so much turmoil. Kargth knew that once battle was joined, they would kill them all. They were barely controlled animals once the scent of blood reached them. All of them had a story to tell, like that of Cyrene. Their first lives had been harsh and unfair, and they were sure to make sure it never happened again. It took them the rest of the day to make it to the outskirts of the highwayman hideout. It was dark now, just past dusk. The last rays of sunlight were disappearing from in between the cracks in the forest canopy. In the distance, amongst what seemed to be a cliff face that had suffered a great rock fall sometime in the past, spots of light could be seen from lit fires. From Kargths current position he could see just over a dozen, which collaborates the reports of approximately thirty men. Several large boulders lay strewn across the landscape ahead of them, creating natural corridors and scrambles. From the road nearby, the fires would be invisible. For Kargth and his men coming from the opposite direction through the forest though, they were as clear as the sun. Looking over to Cyrene, Kargth gave her a curt nod, giving her the order to go ahead with the plan. Eight figures from the group began to move forward, low and silently they dispersed into the terrain. Most had been game hunters, a few were captured bowmen who were liberated from slavers. Now they hunted bigger game. After thirty minutes had past, one of the fires had suddenly gone out. \u201cThat\u2019s our que.\u201d Whispered Cyrene, even though they were far away from the campsite to not be heard, the message was still sent. \u201cForwards men.\u201d Kargth led from the front, the tip of a spearhead formation. As they got closer to the campsite, a body could be seen amongst the brush, moving forward Kargth saw it was a highwayman in leather armour, his dick out and an arrow through his neck. Shot where he stood, taking a piss. The man to his right giggled at the sight but stopped once Kargth turned his helmeted face to him. They had reached the hide out proper now, a few more dead highway men greeting them, slumped against the boulders with blood sprayed behind them, staining the rocks. The sounds of fighting could be heard now. The Vanguard had been discovered. Kargth spoke, loud and clear, both to his men, and to the besieged bandits. \u201cKill them all.\u201d Unsheathing his sword from his scabbard, Kargth ran into the mazed corridors of stone, heading towards the loudest sounds of fighting. His great bulk barely able to fit thought the tight corridors. The rest of the militiamen began to spread out amongst the stones in groups of threes. Forming hunting packs as they moved towards fires or sounds. Above him, Kargth felt the weight of someone jumping down on him from one of the boulders. Screams of anger and fear were heard from this mass of leather and rags. Kargth bent over, the highwayman clinging to his back, stabbing some sort of knife into where the base of his neck would be. \u201cDie you scum\u201d It groaned in between stabs. Kargth backed himself up against the rock, smashing the clutching man between Kargths bulk, and the hard stone. Several cracking noises could be heard, as well as a gasp of air, blood sprayed from the assailant\u2019s lips as he went limp and slid slowly off Kargth. Turning awkwardly around, Kargth drove his sword into the chest of the man, now slumped against the ground, clutching his stomach. He groaned once more, a shudder and made no more sound. Kargths sword now swirling with arcane symbols as the blood from his attacker began to feed its way up the length of the blade. The rents that the ambusher had made in his back begin to meld once more. Moving forward, Kargth came to a large opening, a camp fire and several small tents scattered around. Another highwayman lay strewn across the fire pit, the sound of his burning flesh filling the air. His armour would be of no use know, Kargth would have to find the mans killer and reprimand him for that. Three others were here as well, two militiamen vanguards and one more highway man. The Militiamen were encircling him, their short swords glinting off the slowly smothered fire. The highwayman looked over at Kargth for an instant, a look of dread appearing his face. It was all the vanguard needed. They attacked, one slashing at his legs, the other driving for his throat. The bandit was able to parry the first attack in time, but was too late in averting the second, as the sword slashed fast across face, grasping his gaping wound instinctively the parried man drove his sword into his chest, killing him. Looking over at me, the two vanguard began to approach. \u201cMy lord, one said in between gasping breaths.\u201d We we\u2019re able to kill several of them before the rest knew. Our estimates were slightly over. There are twenty men here, not thirty. We\u2019re almost killed them all as it is now.  Kargth began to think. So far, the scouts had been correct in their assumptions with other camps, down to almost the man. The terrain here led to some guessing, but not to the length of one third over estimation. Suddenly Kargth knew. \u201cIt\u2019s a trap\u201d ", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The Bandit camp lay just over a day\u2019s distance away through the dense forest.

Kargth raised his sword in warning, but it was too late. With faces of hate they stabbed into the backs of the two Vanguard men. In cries of pain and surprise the two militiamen fell to the ground as the two camouflaged bandits continued to stab deep into their flesh. Kargth leapt forward his sword raised above his head, trying to decapitate the one of the right. He swung down, aiming for the base of the skull. The bandit tried to raise his weapon in time, but it was still deep within the flesh of the now dead militiamen. The look of victory wiped from his face as his head cleanly left his body. The bandit on the left, seeing the death of his comrade, quickly retreated from his own now dead mark. Raising his sword up in a defensive stance. Kargth could hear screams now, the sound of surprise followed by sounds of steel on flesh. He roared, his voice deep and full of anger and frustration. Such a carefully laid plan ruined by arrogance and overconfidence. He charged the remaining bandit, catching him off guard. Leaning down, the spikes and ragged edges of his armour acting as a weapon in of itself he impacted the bandit with a heavy crunch. The outlaw let out of yelp of pain and surprise as his body was crushed and lacerated by Kargth. He flew backwards from the momentum of the charge, smashing into the unmoving rock boulders behind him. Blood and brain matter splashed out from his head as it was crushed from the great impact. Looking down at the two dead Vanguard in shame and anger, Kargth moved on towards the nearest sound of fighting. Heading to his left he could hear yelling and the ringing of steel. Rounding a corner, he was faced with Cyrene fighting off two men. A dead militiaman at her feet. She wielded her sword and shield defensively as the two men began to encircle her. \u201cYou can\u2019t kill me!\u201d Cyrene yelled at the two men, her voice strained and ragged from fighting for the last few minutes. \u201cI\u2019m already dead! \u201c She charged one of the men, her shield used as a battering ram her sword raised above her shield, trying to stab at the mans face. Kargth approached the second man and he tried to take an opportunistic swing at Cyrene as her back was turned. A possibly fatal mistake of combat for Cyrene. If she survived tonight, Kargth would have to scold her for that. He parried the deadly blow from Cyrene with his own sword, the sound ringing out as an echo through the rocky maze. Quickly Kargth countered with his left fist, striking the bandits left cheek, crushing his jaw and skull. He fell the ground, his legs and arms jerking. Cyrene was attacking with reckless abandon. Kargth could not even approach as her swings were wild and violent. She was untrained but she fought with such frenzy and brutality that it mattered not against an almost equally untrained opponent. She continued to strike the bandit with her shield and sword, the highwayman barely able to keep up with the parries and dodges, until he misjudged a shield bash and was caught with an opening that Cyrene took full advantage of. She struck the ragged mans side with the full force of her sword, digging deep into his abdomen. A look of surprised overtaking his face as blood burst from his mouth. \u201cplease\u201d He weakly said inbetween spurts of bright red dribbled. Cyrene snarled at his begging, and drew her sword arm high above her head, the bandit weakly raising his sword in defence. She drove it down with a mighty roar filled of anger, hatred and something else that Kargth couldn\u2019t place. Easily bypassing the bandits weak protests it dug deep into his collar. With a gurgling noise, the outlaw fell weakly grasping his wounds as he died. Cyrene continued to roar and began to kick the dead mans face. With each furious strike, the man face slowly began to disappear into a fleshy mess. Kargth let her go for a little bit, it was if she didn\u2019t even know he was there. Eventually, Kargth spoke, clear and with authority. \u201cEnough\u201d Snapping out of her berserker state, she rounded. Almost surprised to see Kargth standing there watching her. The sounds of fighting had ceased. The ambushed defeated. There was only silence. \u201cSorry commander.\u201d Cyrene said, clearing her throat and wiping away blood that had been sprayed onto her face. \u201cGot a bit carried away.\u201dKargth nodded. \u201cYour fury is commendable but lacks focus. You would be dead if I had not arrived.\u201d He pointed with his sword towards the crushed skull of the bandit he had killed. \u201cHe would have sliced right through you in your desire to destroy the other one.\u201d She looked down at the dead body that Kargth was indicating. \u201cMy mistake, it won\u2019t happen again\u201d She said after a pause. \u201cGood, now tend to the wounded. I fear we lost many today.\u201d Kargth replied, sheathing his sword. \u201cI will tend to the bodies.\u201d", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Kargth\u2019s suspicions were affirmed as two men appeared out of cracks in-between rocks behind the two militiamen, wearing dull stained robes of grey they were indistinguishable from the surrounding rock at night. Kargth raised his sword in warning, but it was too late. With faces of hate they stabbed into the backs of the two Vanguard men. In cries of pain and surprise the two militiamen fell to the ground as the two camouflaged bandits continued to stab deep into their flesh. Kargth leapt forward his sword raised above his head, trying to decapitate the one of the right. He swung down, aiming for the base of the skull. The bandit tried to raise his weapon in time, but it was still deep within the flesh of the now dead militiamen. The look of victory wiped from his face as his head cleanly left his body.

She was bone tired from the two weeklong trade mission to Isra. The town looked in bad shape she observed as it came into view, although it was the largest community in the valley by far, several empty buildings lined the riverbank. Only the occasional fisherman sitting on the side of the main wharf could be seen in the early morning mist as the Isran Trade ship glided into the small harbour. Although the town boasted 400 members in its community, almost a hundred of that number were smugglers, slavers or accomplices of the various outlaws in the area. Some were able to flee before the bulk of the militia was able to move in almost a month ago, most were not, and their blood turned the murky brown river of the docks a tint red for almost a day. This left several properties, business and homes suddenly without owners, which the Militia quickly took over. The community had yet to be able to recover from the sudden loss of population and business, as immoral as they were.  As the main trading hub of the area, being the only possible access to the Quite River it was an economic and strategic asset to whoever controls it. As such, the garrison of militia soldiers here was almost as large as the one back at Fort Silence. That was about to change. Cyrene thought. The large trade vessel slowed and was tethered to the main wharf as platoon of just over thirty Isran soldiers began to disembark. Their armour and gear clean and well maintained, a stark contrast to the surrounding environment of mud and dirt. They lined up in neat rows on the solid ground of the wharf, awaiting orders to disembark the rest of the gear. A look of disgust or boredom seen on many of the men\u2019s faces.  As part of the trade deal, the Isran Empire asked for a garrison of their own men to be present into town, to protect their investments and the lives of their traders. Several of the town\u2019s folk began to appear now, alerted by the yelling commands of the soldier\u2019s officer and that of the ships crew as cargo began to be unloaded. It took Cyrene almost a whole day to smooth over the wrinkles that arose from their arrival. Many of the town folk were concerned about the platoon of over thirty professional soldiers appearing and suddenly taking up residence in one of the buildings that the silent militia liberated, which they quickly began to fortify. The anger and concern over the soldiers quickly dissipated once the townsfolk saw what else was being offloaded off the trade ship. Over 10 tons of grain and food stuff and 60 tons of processed iron metal had been brought back from Isra. Food and supplies desperately needed for the small communities of the Valley. The news of the vital supplies quickly spread through out the town and soon the dock was abuzz with strong men and harbour authorities to help unload the vessel.By the end of the day all the supplies had been unloaded. With the town guarded by Isran Soldiers, the next day The Silent Militia was able to escort the remaining food and other iron stores to the surrounding villages without fear of spreading their forces too thin. Grain and seed taken to the farming village of Switch Back Valley were met with applause and tearful words of thank you. With the farmland of the area pillaged by the previously roaming bandits, this gift was a lifeline to the community who could now plant seeds for the spring harvest. To the north, the shipment of iron to the Lumberyards of Forest Hill were much needed. The tools and machines of the lumberjacks that sorely needed replacement began to be repaired, with new machines able to be made to quicken production of the precious Iron Wood lumber. What was left of the imports was taken to Fort Silence, along with Cyrene. The remaining iron being handed over to the resident blacksmith, who was overjoyed at working with purified iron instead of scraps and salvage. With the remaining grain used to stock the storerooms to feed the growing population of soldiers and their families that lived within its granite walls.By the end of the third day after Cyrene\u2019s arrival the first shipment of Ironwood logs was being taken back to Isra. And a great feast was held within the halls of the fort with over fifty of the silent militia present, as well as the captain of the Isran garrison. Although Kargth\u2019s great stone throne in the middle of the head table was empty, as he remained in Isra for personal business, many toasts where given to him, with many of the soldiers raising tankards to the vacant spot. As Cyrene sat to the empty stone thrones right, watching the veritable party unfold in front of her a thought appeared.

Wulfric, on the other hand, began to reorganize the party and prepared to head north...Paylor yawned. It was just past dusk, and his patrol had only just begun. Although it had been almost a month now since Lord Kargth and the Silent Militia cleansed the valley of the various vagabond and slavers who use to travel through these lands, some still tried to slip through. The area was one of the only safe passes through the mountain ranges separating the north from the south, as well as easy access to the ocean shipping routes. Most of the outlaw gangs had learned that they could no longer use the area, but some where foolhardy or dumb enough to try anyway. Normally coming at night through dense forests the bandits avoided the roads and major settlements in their hope to slip by undetected. It was what Paylor and his patrol of a dozen men, mostly hunters or trackers from their past lives, were trying to prevent. They moved through the dense forests silently, careful not to disturb the wildlife, or any possible outlaws. Paylor felt a tap on his shoulder from one of the men behind him. He turned; the vague outline of his comrade seen in the dim light. He gave him a series of signals. \u201cLight ahead to the east.\u201d He gestured. Paylor turned back around, craning his neck in the direction pointed to him. He saw it, just faintly, a dull glow. Coming from fires, a lot of them. Paylor gulped. Was this the counterattack that some of the men had suspected was coming? A mass attack by what remained of the slaves and bandits to rid the valley of their competition? There was only one way to find out.Paylor raised his hands and gestured for the group to disperse amongst the great trees and to approach slowly, and for one of their number to retreat to warn the fort of the possible assault. Once the commands were given, and the messenger sent, the rest advanced. It took just over half an hour to reach the outskirts of the great encampment. Moving slowly and with great care the patrol moved closer still. Paylor spotted a sentry just a dozen meters from the camp proper. He was slumped up against a tree facing out. Sound asleep. Paylor approached him, being careful not to wake the sleeping sentinel. The man seemed exhausted. His clothes, such as they were, looked more like rags then any uniform. His sword old and rust spotted. The man himself looked no better then the clothes he wore though, Paylor realised. Whoever this man was, he had not seen a decent meal in many weeks. Paylor ordered his men to move closer past the lapsed security to investigate further. It was then that Paylor noticed the children. Sleeping in the arms of women who seemed just as malnourished and ragged as the sleeping soldier Paylor has passed. This was no bandit encampment, Paylor realised. It was a refugee camp. Quickly Paylor ordered his men to retreat into the wood line before they were detected. Once again, he commanded a messenger to head to the fort, this time to speak of what was here. Once the messenger had left and his men were four dozen or so meters from the sentry, Paylor called out, to announce their presence to the refugees. \u201cPeople of unknown lands. You have been found within the lands under the control of the Silent Militia. You will state your intent in our lands. We are not wicked, but we will defend our lands and our people from any aggressors. \u201c", "link_list": ["/post/90184/thread", "/user/3419"], "image_list": ["//storage.proboards.com/6046952/avatar/ahOvZfjFJhxhtTisJaHF.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@wulfric\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/90184/thread\" timestamp=\"1557659001\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-3419\" title=\"Wulfric\"><img alt=\"Wulfric Avatar\" src=\"//storage.proboards.com/6046952/avatar/ahOvZfjFJhxhtTisJaHF.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/90184/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1557659001000\" title=\"May 12, 2019 3:03:21 GMT -8\">May 12, 2019 3:03:21 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-3419 group-0\" href=\"/user/3419\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@wulfric\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Wulfric</span></a></span> said:</div>A small column numbering about one-hundred entered the Forgotten Valley from the western road.

Previously weary and weak soldiers looked invigorated. Their apparent training pushing aside the exhaustion that clouded their minds second earlier. It was obvious from Paylors vision that these men had once been a professional army. You can\u2019t get that level of mental control and conditioning over ones decaying body with conscripts. The real question was what they were doing here?After a brief, and somewhat heated discussion, with his second in command in the patrol it was decided that Paylor would reveal himself to the now aware camp. Paylor argued that it was the best way to get as much information from them, as well as the best stalling method while reinforcements from the fort were organised and sent. As such, Paylor took a deep breath, consciously deciding to sheath his bow around his back and walked forward out of his position of darkness, and into the light. To those peering into the dark forest it would almost seem he had appeared from nothing. The darkened leather armour and local foliage that Paylor and the other Vanguard wore on their person made it look at first that a dark human shaped bush was moving forwards. After a few steps into the light, revealing himself to the awaiting horsemen. Paylor stopped and blinked his dirtied face several times, adjusting himself to the brightness. He kept his arms lowered and at his side, trying to appear as casual as possible to these new comers. \u201cI am Paylor, Vanguard of the Silent Militia, under the command of Lord Kargth. We control, police and protect this valley in which you have made your campsite. You are lucky we we\u2019re the first to find you.
