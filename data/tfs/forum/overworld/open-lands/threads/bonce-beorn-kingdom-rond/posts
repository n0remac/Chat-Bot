It was built not only to watch the mouth of the Zephyr River that pours into the Ryel, but also as a way to be the first major city on the Ryel to accept trade from ships traveling up and down the Ryel. Across the mouth of the Zephyr River is the battle fort of Koen, where most of the military is stored. The Tower is high and well-fortified, and can see far up and down the River.Although trade with Rondon is strictly prohibited, Beorn has a thriving Black Market community with many Rondi contacts, as well as smuggling routes developed beneath the nose of the towering Koen just across the way.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.pinimg.com/564x/3a/a8/15/3aa815742a2b6daaf44f55fd7adf6ad6.jpg"], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.pinimg.com/564x/3a/a8/15/3aa815742a2b6daaf44f55fd7adf6ad6.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/></div>"}, "post-78737": {"user": "Alfonso de Rond\u00f3n", "user_num": 2776, "timestamp": "1516748912000", "message": "Daybreak.Selected Rond\u00ed soldiers beat on their war drums as Alfonso's fleet set sail southward, towards the Zephyr stronghold of Beorn.  Not only would the rhythm allow the ships to keep a consistent pace, but it would ready the men who were about to spill blood on Zephyrian shores.  Morale would be important; heavy casualties were expected.As the Rond\u00ed vessels began to close in on their destination, Alfonso gave the order to sound the horns.  If the war drums did not alert the Beorn civilians, then the horns would.  El Diablo Encarnado hoped this would goad Beorn's soldiers into position.Alfonso's force was divided into three main divisions: Sorcerers, Infantry, and Special Cavalry.The largest was the Infantry Division, coming in on moderately-sized swift ships.  Leather had been applied to the front of the ships to act as a flame retardant.  The bow of each vessel had been fitted with ramp-like apparatuses, which not only shielded the riders from ranged attacks, but would also provide a means to quickly disembark.Gabriel Taurtoya   and Feanor Vala   had been assigned to the Infantry Division.  They would be accompanied by a personal bodyguard unit outfitted to their preference.  However, the Rond\u00ed infantry had been specifically equipped with medium armor, tower shields, and their choice of a sword or spear - or both.The Sorcerer Division was the smallest of the three, and they had been spread evenly across the Infantry Division's amphibious vessels.  Once the Rond\u00ed fleet was within range, Alfonso gave the order for the Sorcerers to cast whatever spells they could to disrupt the Zephyr battle lines - specifically where they thought the lines were weakest.As the Zephyrian lines were being bombarded, the infantry ships would row full force ahead and drive themselves upon land.  The ramps would be dropped and the Rond\u00ed warriors would spill out.  They had been instructed before the battle to form a strong, cohesive, defensive line with their tower shields.Bombard the Zephyrian defenses on the beach, and then form a defensive line with infantry - that was the main plan.  During this amphibious assault a number of ships broke off the main fleet; they were lighter and thus quicker.  These vessels carried horses and their riders - the Special Cavalry Division.  Some of these men were jinetes belonging to Alfonso's Headhunters; the rest were experienced cavalrymen from Rond\u00f3n.Kirian Krysin   was in this group, alongside Alfonso.  There the two stood on their swift ships, coursing through the Ryel River to an empty space on the outskirts of the city - away from the battle.  El Diablo Encarnado had heard of this young man's equestrianism - and had hand-chosen him to be his aide during this battle.Thus far, however, Alfonso had neglected to tell him the role of the Special Cavalry.  \"Disembark there,\" Alfonso pointed to a flat location on the beach, where the men could mount their stallions and proceed onto land unmolested.  \"Mount up, Kirian, let's go.\"  Alfonso and Krysin would take the lead as the Special Cavalry Division completely ditched their ships, and sped off southwards - as if to bypass the battle completely and make their way to the city of Zephyr itself!", "link_list": ["/user/2775", "/user/1676", "/user/470"], "image_list": [], "html": "Daybreak."}, "post-78785": {"user": "Feanor Vala", "user_num": 1676, "timestamp": "1516827285000", "message": "Feanor made his way to the location of Alfonso, fearing that his Rangers were not quite being used to their full potential.\"Commander Alfonso?

Magic had a price and took time, after all, so the sorcerers and mages could not be depended on to do all of the heavy lifting.There were no Zephyy Men to meet them on the shores of Beorn, as all attacks came from a distance behind the walls. Thick chains were laid over the river between Beorn and Koen, so no ships could sail up the Zephyr River, and trebuchets were lobbing heavy stones and explosive clay pots over the walls.

Arrows raining down them from the walls so thick they made a buzzing noise as they fell.It was when the man next to him took a shaft to the leg that Gabriel finally snapped free of his stupor. \"FORM UP!\" Lifting his kite shield high he catches an arrow that that might have taken his life on it. The tip blunting against the metal coating of the wood and deflecting it to the ground. All around him men snap to attention as veterans or other young men like Gabriel yell at them to come to remember their training. Around him, the remaining members of his squad form up creating an interlocking shell of shields to defend against the arrows. \"We must protect the ladders!\"Some of the ships were carrying heavier siege equipment but to take the walls their only option had been ladders. Battering rams or siege towers couldn't possibly fit on the launches sent for landing but ladders would work. As he speaks a clay pot shatters against his shield and his nostrils flare at the familiar smell. \"Oil!\" He drops his shield and tosses it away. \"Close the gape and grab a new shield from the dead if you got any on yours. These Zephyr cowards are going to try and burn us.\" Taking his own advice he snatches up a fresh shield from the man who'd died next to him not a moment before. He tries to ignore the ungodly smell that was already wafting up from the battlefield. Blood, shit, and piss all coming together thick enough to gag a man should he breathe into deeply or think on it too long.The company begins to crawl forward the infantrymen with their shields providing cover from the arrows for the ladder crew. Any time one of them fell, and they did, Gabriel was quick to bark an order to see those in the back move up. He did not know why this responsibility was on him, beyond the fact that among the first to die had been their Sargent, but he would do it because he was the only one not afraid. Or at least that would be the story the men around him would tell. In truth, he was scared enough that he'd have emptied his bladder had he not done so on the ship at the advice of the now departed Sargent. Yet he considered that fear an affront to his Rondi blood and so he fed it into the burning thirst for vengeance in his soul. These Zephyr cowards would pay tenfold for every drop of Rondi blood they had spilled today. Each one of them would be to him the one-eyed man who killed his father as he hews their heads from their necks.Against all odds, they reach the wall. They were among the lucky few as many ladder teams had been decimated either by fire, a stone, or arrows. The Rondi archers who were providing as much covering fire as they could focus their arrows around the tops of the walls where the top of the siege ladders came to rest. As the one Gabriel was guarding impacts against the stone he leaps onto it, leading the charge to claim the wall.Coming over the lip he finds a Zephyr man, a boy really likely a few years younger than Gabriel, about to try and throw the ladder away. Gabriel does not hesitate he grabs his punch dagger from his belt and drives it into the boy's chest, shoving the boy back into the other Zephyr troops. Then Gabriel is over the lip and on top the wall itself surrounded by Zephyr troop. Drawing his arming sword and shield he bellows. \"FOR RONDON! FOR THE QUEEN! FOR VENGEANCE!\"The finely made steel of Emanual Taurtoya test the iron of the Zephyr soldiers and finds it wanting. Gabriel fights like a man possessed his father's sword cutting through mail with almost the same ease as flesh as he keeps the top of the ladder clear. More and more Rondi come to join him on the wall as he continues to fight. Would they be able to claim it? Or would the Zephyr troops be able to push them back? Gabriel did not know all he knew was that today, atop this wall, he would spill as much Zephyr blood as he could.

It was when they had come within distance that the Rondi ships could then start firing their trebuchet that Soraya had to lower the protection around the ships -- the spell was meant to make sure that nothing came in, and nothing came out.The skull-painted sorceress' ship came upon the beach that was littered with Rondi bodies -- the smell of blood, of shit and piss, of burning flesh heavy in the air that was beginning to fill with the thick, acrid smoke of the oil that the Zephyy men on Beorn's walls were throwing down. Arrows were raining from the sky -- some on fire, some not -- and a few of the mages were instantly killed.The trebuchet on the Rondi ships were sending flaming balls of fire high into the air, over the walls of Beorn -- but they were similarly being destroyed as Soraya had done for the boulders. The difference was that the Rondi ammunition shattered into flaming pieces that fell all over the ground, rather than rock that sank into the water, so although they had not yet destroyed any buildings in Beorn, things were starting to gradually catch fire.She couldn't summon a storm, because it would put out the Rondi fires as well, and she couldn't summon a wind because of the same problem.

Other mages did the same effect to the men around them -- and these enchantments would only last for as long as the origin mage stayed alive.However, it was enough to make the Rondi men surge forward toward those gates and those walls -- gates that had been reinforced with magic to be like stone, or even stronger.While men like Gabriel Taurtoya went to get over the walls -- dying by the dozens for every single ladder that was put up, most ladders cut and destroyed or poured with oil and fire as they tried to get them over the walls -- Soraya tried to run over the beach and the ports, using piles of dead Rondi bodies for cover.She could not discern where the Harbor Gate was, given it was enchanted to appear as well (and be just as thick and resilient, if not more so), so Soraya's duty was to get too the wall and f i n d\u00a0 i t, even as man after Rondi man was swiftly taken to LaMuerta.", "link_list": ["/user/2775"], "image_list": [], "html": "There was an active "}, "post-78946": {"user": "Alfonso de Rond\u00f3n", "user_num": 2776, "timestamp": "1517146291000", "message": "The efforts of Gabriel Taurtoya and @soraya would hopefully distract the defenders of Beorn.

Gabriel gets a momentary spot of calm as he has enough Rondi around him on the wall now to have on side protected. For the longest time, they had died almost as quickly as they could mount the wall. Some of the ladders had been kicked down sending men halfway up screaming to their deaths as others scrambled for cover. Some ladders had been drenched in oil the fires still blazing brightly. Yet almost as fast meant that some of the Rondi's on the wall managed to live. One in every ten perhaps?Below bodies are dragged out of the way, more ladders are brought up the beach, and more men die to arrows, boulders, and fire. So many corpses already lie in the sand Gabriel can't help but wonder how many villages just lost every man that had lived in them. Yet as the Rondi foothold on the wall solidifies less and less men die on the beach as Zephyr attention focuses in on retaking the wall.

Once he was over the wall, he could see how wide and how stout Beorn truly was -- could see the magical barriers that were preventing the burning ammunition tossed by Rondi's trebuchet from hitting their marks.He could also see the hundreds of Zephyy men, their faces grim and determined to protect their home from blood-thirsty invaders and conquerors -- Rondi men and women that had tortured them for centuries. But that is not what Gabriel thought of himself as, that is not what every Rondi man behind him -- dead, or otherwise -- thought, either.They would finally put an end to a country poisoned by terrible people with terrible morals. LaMuerta was with them, giving them strength (not realizing that it was @soraya and the efforts of her mages).They fought like savages once they could crawl over the walls, two or three good ladders down defended by the Rondi men who could get there. There was no way that that would be enough, however. There were too many Zephyy men, and their archers were picking them off like flies.Still, Gabriel was a lion, a symbol of the Rondi Rage that could be seen and could be shared. The vision of him was enough to make the hearts of the men behind him harden in fury, their minds narrowed in single-minded determination to follow him -- for he was the voice of Rondon for these troops of men able to get over the walls.They were gaining inches.... but they could not sustain...... until they heard the Rondi Trumpets that blasted like T H U N D E R from the eastern Land Gate of Beorn, where Alfonso de Rond\u00f3n was making his charge with Feanor Vala and Kirian Krysin. It ripped attention away from some of the Zephyy men, who paid for it with their lives amidst the shout of their Zephyy commanders reminding them to stay on task.Hundreds of Zephyy men were lined up outside the Land Gate of Beorn, the flag of Zephyr and the flag of Beorn held proudly in their midst. They were clearly well-armored, and were just as clearly determined to protect what was their own.They, however, did not have horses, and seeing the Rondi Cavalry, made the front line of men -- fodder -- take a step back. They were archers, and there were boltmen, they were handled with spears -- for they knew that Rondon was famous for its war horses and cavalry and equine might -- and even more men lined the walls.As the mounted infantry made their charge, Kirian Krysin led them with his own battle cry, his armor brilliant and his horse like a beast out of legend unto the Zephyy infantry. The Rondi trumpets of the mounted infantry shattered into the atmosphere, drowning out the screams of terror and death from the Harbor Gate beach--And they road.They charged for the land gate, no need for war drums as the hundreds of hooves of the Rondi horses made a symphony of inevitable death. Behind the mounted infantry were the sleek and beautiful Mithlonde unit of Feanor Vala slid from their horses, unseen in the coming tidal wave of Rondi fury--And when the Zephyy archers fired their horde arrows, they found many of their arrows shot down by those of the still-unseen Mithlonde archers, so great was the elven skill, allowing for Krysin's mounted infantry to take so few loses that a cry of anguish could actually be heard from the Zephyy line.The Mithlonde archers began to target anyone that seemed of importance -- anyone with fancier armor, with plumes, with regalia to show them as officers -- and while some of their arrows hit true, it was quickly made evident that the Zephyy officers -- true officers of noble blood -- had some sort of charm on them that seemed to deal with arrows as if they were nothing more than flies, mini arcane shields bubbling where arrows might have hit.Zephyy sharpshooters on the wall began to target the Mithlonde archers -- for although those on the ground could perhaps not see them, those upon the walls had better views -- and as trained archers and hunters themselves, they knew how to follow trajectory to find the shooter.It was when Krysin's cavalry was close enough to almost clash that three men upon the walls -- dressed as regular Zephyy soldiers -- lifted their arms, and the ground rumbled -- not for hooves, not for fury -- but for revenge as Krysin and the first few lines of charging horses managed to cross a magical leyline... but the others were caught in sudden chasms opening making Rondi rider and horse scream in surprise and agony as a \"crater\" twelve feet wide and long enough for the Zephyy defensive line\u00a0 opened up. It wasn't deep but then, it didn't have to be deep -- six feet, deep enough for a grave, was enough. Hundreds of horses fell, so many dying as necks and legs were snapped, riders thrown into the chaos of the tumbling boulders and earth, suffering the same fate as their riders. After all, these were not cavalrymen, but infantrymen while Alfonso de Rond\u00f3n took the special mounted cavalry elsewhere.For Kirian Krysin, his line of horses no doubt smashed into the first several lines of men, but the swelling cacophony of Rondi Failure behind his back severely effected the other men with him. Men were dying all around him... pulled from their horses, impaled in their saddles, and the arrows continued to rain down.Win Beorn, Alfonso, and you shall have your prize.What would El Diablo Incarnado do?", "link_list": ["/user/2775", "/user/2776", "/user/1676", "/user/470", "/user/470", "/user/1676", "/user/2776"], "image_list": [], "html": "<span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-2775 group-0\" href=\"/user/2775\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@gabriel\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Gabriel Taurtoya</span></a></span>"}, "post-79202": {"user": "Feanor Vala", "user_num": 1676, "timestamp": "1517604746000", "message": "This was the key moment then.

It was this moment that Kirian noticed the Zephyy trap, as a sea of horses and riders descended into a pit like water spilling over a bowl. He knew immediately that he was now in a perilous position, that he and those few at the front who reached the Zephyr lines were now horrendously outnumbered.

There were so many men trying to get to the wall. Bodies were crumpled against it like forgotten mounds of rancid laundry, debris of ropes and ladders shattered along the corpses and remains.Her spell to invigorate soldiers was like a weight on her soul -- she could feel the drain of her as she kept their stamina, their health, their vitality -- their strength and speed and reflexes -- alive and strong, but like weights on a string, she could feel the death of each men, the lightness of the load of her spell -- and one thread in particular, Gabriel Taurtoya, seemed to shine brightly in her mind's eye, gaining the mana she had been feeding into fallen soldiers instead.But it wouldn't be enough. Not while the mages were focused on the dying -- and not on the living.A harsh reality was sent out via her telepathic link to them, noticing how few there were left from where they started. Her dark hair was matted with sweat and blood and grime, but it was still, for the most part, pulled back into that slick, thick braid that fell between her shoulder blades.Leave the dying men to LaMuerta -- she is a far better comfort than the realities they will have to live with. I need focus now -- throw sand into the faces of the Zephyy on the wall, distract them from those climbing the ladders!Soraya took cover in a dune, and she could feel the mind's and mana of the other Rondi mages on the beach pool with hers, and whirling onto her feet, she threw up her hands and an incredible wall of scarlet sand whooshed into existence, tall, tall taller than the wall around Beorn, and then it went surging forward like a tidal wave, it's gale rushing over the men on the wall.\"GO, YOU IDIOTS!\" Soraya snapped at the Rondi men that were unaffected by the sand, and they began to rush the ladders while the mages held the line, using Soraya as point.

The sand wall kept itself for a few moments as she heard a ringing in her ears and for a moment, heard none of the screams and cries of agony and war. Her hand swept to where a crossbow bolt was lodged into her shoulder, and she turned onto her side just before the sand attack faded....... to see a softened glow around a portion of the wall, where ever grain of sand that hit upon it made a ripple of magic. It was the disguised Harbor Gate, and gritting her teeth, she stood upon the sand, sloshing in the Ryel River that took advantage of the lack of sand to hold it back and swept ever closer.

As if the arms of LaMuerta were around her, she felt the skull lines painted on her face buzz, the flowers around her eyes blossom in her mind's eye with the sight and smell and vision of power. The pain in her shoulder ebbed away, the hot stickiness of the blood coursing down her arm was a dream away.There were now Zephyy soldiers to watch her, too panicked by the surge of Rondi that had taken advantage of the sand blast to climb the ladders, and she could hear LaMuerta's kind and warm voice in her ear, stroking sweaty hair from her temple.Let.Go.And the Harbor Gate on Beorn's beach BLASTED open from a surging rocket of power from Soraya, throwing stone, wood, and men -- Zephyy and Rondi both -- high into the air, the sound of it screaming across the battlefield and beyond as magic that appeared to be the golden roses of LaMuerta and Rondon and Xiomara burst into the air and the magic drifted down like rose petals.Rose petals on a field of dead.And as Soraya collapsed onto her knees in the filthy, bloody, disgusting, inches-deep water of the Ryel, the Rondi men on the beach rallied and surged through the sudden hole in the wall, just in time to witness Gabriel Taurtoya's own valiant efforts.There would still be fighting inside Beorn, high resistant and magical attacks of fire and lightning on the invading Rondi men, returned with steel and arcane from Rondi itself, but perhaps the sound of the blast here would help spur on those attacking at the River and Land Gates", "link_list": ["/user/2775"], "image_list": [], "html": "Soraya knew as she ran along the blood-drenched beach -- turning sand into deep, dark wine-colored mud -- that she would never, ever be able to wash the dirtiness she felt from her skin, would never be able to unhear the sounds of men dying, being sent to "}, "post-79237": {"user": "Gabriel Taurtoya", "user_num": 2775, "timestamp": "1517628791000", "message": "Like a raging bull, Gabriel charged into the Zephyy line, his father's blade acting as his horn. He gored a man the arming sword punching through armor and plate as though it wasn't even there. The man's guts spilling from the wound as Gabriel tore the blade free. The young man who had mere months ago been little more than an apprentice blacksmith stood against impossible odds and in the doing became a symbol. Every man he killed, every blow he shrugged off, every roar of his voice made him less a man and more a force. Yet it was not enough.The momentum his mad charge gave could only carry the Rondi so far. They were a nail being driven into the wood and while Gabriel had provided a mighty blow they'd hit a knot. They'd not sunk in deep enough on that first blow and now they were stuck. The Zephyy men were clustered around them and they began to push back. The Rondi push ground to a halt and it would only be a matter of time before they would be pushed back. Those precious inches that had been bought with the lives of the dead would be swallowed back up if nothing changed.Then the blessing ended.The weight of his exhaustion hit Gabriel hard enough that he barely felt the sword that finally pierced his mail and gouged a hole in his shoulder. The shield that should have been there to block the attack had sagged as it became impossibly heavy to muscles sore from ignored fatigue and unnatural use. The young man who had been the only thing propping up the morale of the defenders on the wall dropped to his knees looking up into the face of the Zephyy who was about to kill him. Death should not have looked so terrified.Just as he had torn his blade from the guts of that Zephyy an eternity ago, the young soldier who seemed to be almost scared out of his wits tore his blade out of Gabriel's shoulder. The son of Emanuel Taurtoya gasps in pain the first sign vocal sign of weakness he'd shown. This seemed to bolster the young soldier's determination. The mask of fear turning to one of hate and determination as he goes to bring his sword, that worthless piece of Zephyy iron down upon Gabriel's head. The young Rondi's now hazy mind wondering why LaMuerta had shown her blessing only to so quickly and cruelly take it away. Red sands blow in.At first, Gabriel thought the red was a haze of blood falling across his eyes. The last thing he would see before his damnation. For surely he would be doomed to wander the earth as a ghost having died without avenging his father. It takes him a moment to realize the Zephyy are screaming. Another to realize that the haze is caused by sand. Sand that seemed to drive into the eyes of the Zephyy while leaving Rondi men unharmed. \"I am sorry I ever doubted.\" He whispers this prayer to LaMeurta who had clearly chosen a new way to help her favored people.And the tide turned.All around him Rondi men tried to figure out what was going on until a shouted command snapped them back to reality. A flood of righteous Rondi came up the ladders. While the Zephyy still tried to recover the Rondi began to kill them. the wall was soon thick with Rondi, a new strike of the hammer driving the nail home. Gabriel's body was too weary to move, too wounded to fight, too numb to feel. Yet he would not let others spill blood while he did nothing. With a mighty roar, the raging bull surged to his feet the Rondi around him heard his renewed cry and joined him.The young bull charged.Gabriel's shield clatters to the ground, his left arm made near useless by his injury. But his right could still hold a blade even if it could barely do more than that. Like a man possessed he slams into a clump of Zephy soldiers, the press of his fellows at his back carrying him through. They would take the gate, they would lay this city bare, they would have victory. He could not kill as he once had instead he bull rushed a man right off the wall sending him plummeting to his death Gabriel almost losing his own footing in the process.But the world was torn away.There had been a noise so loud it may have been LaMuerta throwing open the way to the land of the dead. A force had hammered into Gabriel's back, even had he not already been half ready to fall over he'd not have been able to stand against the force of the impact. He'd been sent spiraling into the air and as he began to fall he'd watched the world rush up to meet him before all went black. For the second time that day he faced death this time too tired to regret.It was not yet his time.The sound of the ongoing battle rouses Gabriel from his brief slumber. Above him, he can see the sky, cloudy from smoke tinged orange with fire yet the sun still streams through the hole in the roof. He was laying in a pile of hay splinters of slightly rotted wood all around him. He'd crashed through the roof of an old disused stable near the walls somewhere close to the gate. With a groan, he pushes himself to his feet. So exhausted he can't even be bothered to marvel that he is still alive. After all, he felt like he was dead.Outside, the city was beginning to fall.Gabriel could see a massive hole in the wall where gate must have once stood. He could only just see it from his position but he could still hear the sounds of battle. The gate had fallen and now the Rondi are free to pour into the city. Without the need to scale the wall, a wall that had already almost been taken thanks to the sandstorm, the Rondi infantry could bring their full force to bear and they did so gladly. There is no side of his arming sword, his father's sword he must have lost it in the fall. So drawing his dagger Gabriel staggers towards the sound of battle.

A commander... with one eye. The Rondi men had strong morale, but they had been fighting for long hour after hour after hour just to get up the beach to Beorn, and hundreds of their comrads had already died.The wave of Rondi -- including Gabriel Taurtoya swept against the Zephyy soldiers... and the Zephyy soldiers hit back, hard. They were not going to lose their city. They were not going to lose their pride. They were not going to lose their country.

He was not sure when the god of dreams began to stalk him but he knew why the deity was there. Or at least he suspected why. He'd been dropped just within the wall after the explosion shattered the gate and sent him flying. It had taken him some effort but he'd managed to fight his way back to his fellow Rondi. Those on the ground had not recognized him, only the ones on the wall had seen his acts of heroism but they'd accepted him into their ranks. Every blade was needed after all.No more need to run wild.Everything in Gabriel's field of view was fuzzy and indistinct. Everything but the apparition of the diety. Was it truly an apparition or was it merely a hallucination? There was a thick cloud in his mind, everything felt numb. His left arm hung useless at his side so he'd been shifted to the right of the formation. They were charging the Zephyy line, at some point he'd replaced his dagger with a proper arming sword once more. It was inferior to his father's blade but still better than the dagger. Lay down your head and dream.Gabriel just wanted it to end. He was sure he'd died when he fell from the wall and he was nothing more than a spirit. Some kind of revenant forced to continue on when everything was pain. LoSueno was there with his guitar trying to tempt him to fall, to lay down his head and give in. To go to the god's love for his final rest. It was so tempting. The city still stood but there were so many Rondi here. Even though the Zephyy outnumbered them, the commanders had promised victory they would not have lied. One less swordsman would not make the difference surely? My dear, do not tempt the young bull.The blade came down cleaving into a Zephyy neck. Everything around him there was death. The sickly scent of burnt flesh was the only thing he could smell. He shouldn't be happy about that but it covered up the stench of shit, piss, and blood so he did not care. Someone was shouting about mages but he did not care. He had died at some point of that he was sure. Now he was in LaMeurta's realm and this was his punishment for failure, an endless war. He could not stop fighting even if he wanted to.Until he's had vengeance in full.The visage of his goddess had joined that of her love. The two were singing a song their voices sounding clear even over the roars, the screams, and the booms. It seemed as though they were discussing something but what could it be? Why had his mind conjured such visions? Was it part of his torment. The goddess lifts her arm and points, the young bull's gaze follows the gesture. There was a man at the back of the Zephyy line. Dressed in the finery of a nobleman, an eye-patch marking an infirmity, and a masterwork blade at his side.For him, I still scheme.A roar was torn from Gabriel's lungs as though the goddess herself had crushed her fist around them. Forcing every last ounce of air from his body to create an ear-shattering bellow. Suddenly the haze of pain is gone replaced with a red mist that covered his vision. The one-eyed man was here. His father's killer was here. Surging forward he brings his sword down with such force that he cleaves right through a man's shield driving the blade into his shoulder. The weapon catches but Gabriel does not pause. He wrenches the dying man's sword from his grasp and charges.He will fight on.The voices of the two deities seem to meld in his ears. No longer does LoSueno try to lure him to sleep. No longer does LaMeurta ask for his life. They are in accord they will let him live until vengeance is his. The strength of his gods enters his body or so the stories would say one day, though perhaps it was simply such a rage that he was pushed beyond mortal bounds. Either way, despite his pain and his injuries he once again fights as the demon with a fire and ferocity that make the Zephyy pause.Though he may not see the dawn.The sword he'd stolen from a dying man snaps in two as he smashes it into the breastplate of a Sargent. Undaunted Gabriel rams the broken sword up into the man's shoulder before grabbing a spear. It was an unfamiliar weapon but he hurls it with all his might at a robed figure. He knows not why only instinct drives him now. The Bull of Rondon looked less a man and more an aberration, blood covering his body leaking from innumerable wounds. The Zephyy began to believe he was a demon in truth for he did not fall despite being stabbed, slashed, and punctured.But perhaps all is not as it seems? Gabriel's teeth sink into flesh. Blood sprays into his mouth as he clamps down hard skin parting as he tears a chunk out of a man's throat. Their blades had been locked, each forcing themselves into the other, and Gabriel's left arm could still barely move. So using his mouth had been the easiest way. The soldier falls to the ground gurgling clutching at his throat. Spitting the flesh away Gabriel barely even paused for a breath. He could see the one-eyed nobleman and the man could certainly see him, could hear him. So the young bull roars.\"MY NAME IS GABRIEL TAURTOYA. YOU KILLED MY FATHER.

As the charge went forward, the elves were impressed at the sheer stubbornness of the Rondi soldiers. They were going about it the hard way...although the Feanor couldn't really see an alternative at the moment.\"Let's get those gates open for them!\" He shouted. Half the Rangers stood and took off at a sprint with him, the elves moving rapidly through the uneven terrain, completely around the flank of the warriors defending the gate. Feanor's grappling hook was the first to catch on the wall, arrows slammed out of the sky by his remaining rangers. Even with the covering fire, two more of his Rangers dropped on the run there as he began to clamber up the wall. Another arrow dropped the guy at the top, and Feanor's blade lashed out in a blur of silver and steel. Three men in fell in an instant, two with throats slashed open, the third with an arrow lodged in his skull. Enough space was clear that the remainder of his Rangers, all eleven of them, climbed up behind him. Three turned and began to back up, protecting the rear of the remainder, who began to beeline for the gate mechanisms in the gatehouse. They were quick with a blade, relying on speed, agility, and honed reflexes to avoid hits instead of any sort of heavy armor.
