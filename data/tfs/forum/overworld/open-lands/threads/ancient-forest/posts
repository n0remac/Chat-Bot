This isn\u2019t because it's particularly difficult, but merely because of its distance from just about anything. Its an ancient part of the world, largely undisturbed by the rapidly industrializing world that lay beyond its thick borders. Its a true haven for the animals and creatures that call this part of the forest its home. Of course, they aren\u2019t the only things that call it home\u2026The trees grow tall all around, unencumbered and unimpeded on their mission to touch the sky. Moss grows on the boulders and rocks that cover the tightly enclosed landscape, and a thick underbrush covers the fresh, verile soils beneath one\u2019s feet. The air is fresh and tinted with the scent of life, and the mists that descend from the mountains beyond are cool and soothing to the touch. It would be hard for an adventurer to find any sort of beaten path, and less so one made by people, this deep in the woods, so be warned. Those who get lost here may find it to be their home for a long while, with only their luck to guide them back out. Some say that the forest spirits will aid those with a pure heart who are lost, but they will just as quickly impede those that have a darkness inside them, and lay in wait for the chance to reclaim those souls. Not to worry though, traveler, they're surely just old wives tales. There are many stories and tales that people tell of these strange, beautiful parts, but whether or not they are true is another story all together. Only those who have been there to live these stories can tell you otherwise.
