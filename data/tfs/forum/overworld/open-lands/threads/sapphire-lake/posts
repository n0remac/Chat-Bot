The small gasp of surprise. Casting about for a moment she hardly caught sight of the woman, not too far away and sat on the bank of the frozen water. Crunching through the snow towards her, the fey slowed slightly as she looked out over the sapphire lake. With the moonlight framing the ice like glass, she could understand how it had gotten its name. The beauty was almost enough to distract her, but she shook herself out of her daze. Even seeing the wonders of nature, her first concern lie on the woman who had seen her. Breaking her stare she completed her short journey, though now that she was upon the woman she noticed the blood. Blinking her solid black eyes, she knelt nearby, reaching a delicate hand out. \"Let me help\" she whispered, as if speaking any louder may break the serene atmosphere. Without waiting for a response, a yellow glow, like the first rays of dawn wreathed her hand heralding her healing abilities. Not touching the wound, she held her hand several inches away, letting her healing powers do their job as they hopefully would take away the pain and injury she had received.
