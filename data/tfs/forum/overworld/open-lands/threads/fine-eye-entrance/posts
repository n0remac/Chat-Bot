A small rusted shed, the local baker\u2019s shop, or perhaps even an oak tree; all these things could be an entrance into the auction. The building the auction itself is held in is a sprawling citadel, numerous towers, and levels sprouting from its base to rise higher and higher into the sky. Yet the most unusual feature of this building is the several titanic rings that encase it. Between the gaps in these rings is a barrier of some sort. The barrier completely surrounds the auction from all sides both top and bottom. Much like the entrance to the auction, the location of the citadel itself is also ever-changing. From the remote frozen north to the vast deserts of the south, those inside the citadel will see a variety of views on any given day.

His hair was swept to the side and combed back with a bit of olive oil. His locks were secured to the back of his head with a bit of twine.Needless to say, the vampire was absolutely dashing. The cloak swept behind him in waves, its flutter alerting those of his entrance. After all, everyone should know they are in the presence of greatness.

Not quite white because despite frequent washings there was no true way to get blood out of fabric, and all the stains had formed one off color of brown and rusty red.

He stopped in front of a dilapidated door, with holes that one could pitch a particularly rambunctious cat through from the end of the alley with ease. Even though the door looked like it had been worn before the cataclysm, the occupant knew for a fact this was the first time he was seeing it. Reaching into the same pocket that the beyond filthy rag was in, he pulled out a rather worn piece of parchment with an odd eye etched onto it. Holding it to the door, it swung open and he stepped through. And into the entrance room. Sniffling still he spied the two fops, well as much as he could with his fogged spectacles. He could guess they were fops because despite his clogged nose they reeked of rather expensive wines and cologne. And olive oil for some reason. Odd character that.
