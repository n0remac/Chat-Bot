As soon as he did it, a barn owl drifted silently out of the sky, and landed atop the sign on the bridge. It regarded Echo for a moment, before setting to preening the brown and white downy feathers that covered it.\"Zenith, we're heading into this tower to try and get some supplies. Why don't you stay outside and I'll call you if needed.\"Zenith the barn owl seemed nonplussed, and continued arranging its feathers with its beak, but did find itself spinning it's head around as it watched Echo step towards the castle gates and rap loudly upon the heavy wood.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "As the farmer stood up from his work repairing the dry stone wall that bordered the road, he noticed the lone individual striding purposely down the track towards him.

The owl rolled his eyes at the hummingbird, before turning back to regard Echo.\"How about you go and visit some of the window ledges of the castle? If I could locate Lord Robynson, or maybe spy on the siblings, it might help get me some answers. Beware those cats though, and try to stay out of sight.\"  The owl continued to watch him expressionlessly, and once he seemed satisfied the talk was over, he turned and took to wing with barely a rustle of feathers.Echo and Nadir returned to their room, made sure that all of the doors and windows were closed and locked, and prepared their beds.

Consumed by anger and betrayal, and further rocked by grief with his wife's passing, he had taken it out on the young noble. Throwing him into the dungeons, he had been chained for weeks in the oubliette before the patriarch visited his anger upon him.

While the anger was still there, a heavy pall of regret twinged his voice as he formally exiled the young noble. With no money or possessions, a commoner of the house had dragged him to the local monastery and dumped him at it's doors.From there, Blind Tad had taken responsible for the vulnerable youngster, slowly ingratiating himself and bringing the youngster back from the brink of mental desolation. Teaching him the arts of perception and unarmed combat, the monk had given him a chance for a new life, and for this Echo would be eternally grateful to the blind old man.

A choir was singing, and the acoustics enriched the noise into something Echo had never witnessed before or since. Overcome with emotion, he had sat within the chapel and simply listened as the voices of the singers reverberated from the high domed ceiling, inspiring feelings of spirituality that he had never before felt. He had stayed at the place for over a month, spending every possible moment just sitting inside the large space listening.He conveyed all of this to the young culinarian. \"We also visited the Whispering Caves of Knut, the Great Canyon of Charn, I listened to the ocean waves crashing against the high cliffs of Clifton. These have all been experiences I will never forget, and I find my life richer for it.\"  Wracking his brain for more interesting stories, he conveyed a tale of being set upon by bandits one night while camped under the stars. Fortunately for Echo, it had been a cloudy, moonless night, and the rogues had underestimated the perceptions of the former noble. Thinking the cover of darkness would aid them in sneaking up unsuspected on the seemingly unwary traveller, they had a rude awakening when he had defeated the half dozen men single-handedly with relative ease.The talk of the siblings had interested Echo, and he was keen to see if he could get any more information from the young man. Whispering to him, he set about enquiring about the younger Robynsons, keen to try and get a lead in identifying the mysterious poisoner. \"You say they are both scary, but have you seen either of them engaged in anything underhanded?  It's possible that poison has been used, and as a member of the castle kitchens, I wonder if there is anything you may have seen leading up to the illnesses of either Lord Robynson or his now deceased eldest?\"  It was a long shot, but Echo was still keen to get to the bottom of the mystery, regardless of the marriage.
