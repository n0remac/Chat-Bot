Behind him were twelve other riders, all armed with mail armor and a combination of axes, shields, swords, berdiche axes, and bows.  They were his druzhina, or bodyguards.  After the absolute destruction of his army back home these twelve companions were all he had left.Oleg rode up beside him.  \"What're you thinking milord?\"  Oleg was Vsevolod's closest friend and adviser, and commander of his druzhina, formerly a close friend and adviser of the Prince's late father.  He was also present during Vsevolod's defeat, and had rescued the young man.  For that Vsevolod owed the man his life.\"Could we go around?\" Vsevolod inquired.\"Would take a bit longer to reach our destination, but if that's what you want to do...\" Oleg answered.  He offered the best counsel he could, but usually left the decision making up to the Prince - even if Vsevolod often chose the worst option.  It was Oleg's way of furnishing Vsevolod's 'princely skills', which would be necessary if he was going to reclaim his throne one day.  He needed to make the choices, and he needed to see the consequences of his actions.  Oleg would do his part and protect his prince as best he could.The Prince of Nowhere wrestled with various scenarios in his mind.  He was ready to be off the road and in the comfort of a city, or even a town.  Living out here in the wilderness, even with Oleg and his faithful druzhina, did not suit the man.  For to long had he lived in the comfort of his family's palace.  This train of thought got the better of him and so he answered: \"we shall go through.  Let us make haste to the next city and rest.\"Vsevolod gave his answer but did not move.  He turned to look at Oleg, expecting his chief bodyguard to lead the advance, but the man instead held his hand out and motioned for the Prince to take charge.
