His centuries of knowledge would ooze out, telling everybody of all manner of spells, forbidden, powerful spells. It was not dangerous, but instead would interfere with minds, muddling thoughts. Magicians may fare better against it however, even gathering knowledge from this.One could most likely decipher the thought patterns of the unconscious God and find a spell of great value, and great destructive power.

Asadobres and Leiron  would find themselves bathed in a warm orange glow as they were flanked by the flames, which careened towards the behemoth.A caveat to her spell was that, as she hadn't had much time to charge it, and it was her first time casting it, it lacked any significant destructive power. However, by nature its area of effect was substantial, enough to encompass the beast in a thin membrane of flames for just a few seconds. Would it harm the behemoth? Not at all.

Silver scaled and onyx clawed the dragon lunged at the behemoth with a roar that echoed through the valley.

Her eyes were fierce and angry, she started biting at the monster, her curved fangs digging into its disgusting flesh and releasing. She was looking for a sweet spot, testing for a good grip.

Now I've been busy myself, sleeping and eating only every other day if I were lucky. I tried to get busy to forget, but that's quite hard because almost anything my line of work has me do doesn't require much brains so they were free to think and wallow in anger. I met people of course, people with whom I connected on a level I cannot describe. But for one reason or another it didn't work out.

Years passed. There's a good chance we're different people. Now, that doesn't mean that the Livilla I gave all sorts of childish promises to isn't still there for me to repeat them. However, its quite possible she's grown too different. The very same thing applies to me. I've seen and done things unsavoury to say the least, but I'm also a lot less daft. Perhaps I've changed too much for you to accept me any more.\" Now dropping off the last individual pieces of his splint and scale Hansel started to pull his chainmail off of himself, continuing when it was entirely off. \"But perhaps our changes will only make us better people in the eyes of the other. So what does this mean? Well, I don't think we can continue where we left off. But I think we can start anew and should fate allow it come to something even better than what was had.
