As she entered the Wily Bear Tavern and Inn she'd come upon the scene of Misaika and Umbra, and would find some attention from the Barkeep. \"Bloimey.\" He stated upon seeing Graciosa. He had seen much of the world and things akin to her, but nothing ever of the exact sort. Much like the people outside he felt beneath his counter to make sure e had the trusty hatchet and crossbow, before giving a welcoming nod. Then he returned his attention to Umbra and Misaika, sighing in internal conflict. He had a past as an adventurer explaining the scars on his face, but he had a business to run! \"Blanket before the fireplace eh? Well, I s'pose I can arrange that. Just give me a silver for each of ya and the arrangement can work for a month or so, though I doubt you'll be needing to stay that long anyway. We won't do the washing for you but you can use the pump around back if you tells nobody. I don't want regular folk begging me for this same deal you see. We'll work out pay for food whenever you want it, and the outhouse around back is free too I suppose. That's as fair as I can do, lass.\" When asked about the caravans, he scratched his head and shrugged. \"I ain't been outside of the town in some time girl. To be frank it's been some time since I even left this place for longer than an hour or so, the business is now my life.\" Then he squinted, expression souring momentarily but then relaxing. \"The bar-keep is supposed to know all the rumours of the town, right? Well, I'll try my best, you adventurer sort are good for the economy. Roads are supposed to be safe, it's hard for bandits to properly set up and most chokepoints for getting to caravans are just as dangerous to the attacker as the defender, you'd have to have some absolute mad lads to try it to be frank. Trolls and Ogres and the like lurk here from the old days when they were at the top of the food chain, but years of fighting's left them scared of getting ire again.\" The man paused to rob an scar on his chin apparently from something particularly hot. \"Old Father Friedrich hasn't shown up, and he visits the town every week; should have been here yesterday. Horis, the ole elf what does most of our magics said the weather is going to be acting out and he was right so far. I wouldn't want to be on a horse when the land here gets particularly muddy, that's all I know I'm afraid.\" ", "link_list": ["/user/2239"], "image_list": [], "html": "<div align=\"justify\">As <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-2239 group-0\" href=\"/user/2239\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@graciosaiscariote\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Graciosa Iscariote</span></a></span> walked along, she would find quite a few eyes upon her. It was an understatement to say she stuck out like a sore thumb, but it is by far the most applicable saying. Folk would glare at her, those with arms about them readjusting their posture just in case. Technically Blackbark had a very welcoming policy but when a lassie with big horns that did not apparently look like they were needed for defence arrived, it was just a wee bit worrisome. <br/></div>"}, "post-86833": {"user": "Misaika", "user_num": 2874, "timestamp": "1541851233000", "message": "\"That's a very simple deduction.\" Misaika answered to Umbra's answer about why the guards were angry at him. \"Were you talking about the rumors you had heard?

Misaika than quickly turned around to the bartender again feeling as if she had let her curiosity linger a bit too long. \"That will work!\" Misaika quickly replied happy that her bargaining had worked so well and she promptly fetched a silver piece to put on the table as she whispered to Umbra. \"I always wanted my own assistant - with a little luck you're better than my last cat.\" she said to Umbra. \"I'm Misaika, what should I call you?\" she inquired.Misaika took in what the bar-keep had told her and after a moment of silence she replied.\"This elf where does he live?
