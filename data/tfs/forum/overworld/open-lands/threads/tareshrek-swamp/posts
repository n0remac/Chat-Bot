Teeming with life among its dark mangroves, the swamp remains largely untouched by the hand of man, leaving it to the animals and creatures that live within. Some might find this place to be gross and generally unpleasant, but most would also say that about the big cities. The trees climb tall from their vast stilted network of roots that jut out of the mossy banks and waters that teem with vegetation, fish, and all sorts of amphibians, and vines hang low and long from far above the lush canopy. Light filters through the leaves, casting rays of sunshine through the fog that rises from the waters that only grow thicker as one approaches the various hot springs that litter the swampy area. Many say its easy to get lost in such a place, as the trees seem to shift and grow abnormally quick, and there are stories of folk who end up lost in the woods being guided back by the swamp spirits, but their appearance is different in every tale. For a seasoned adventurer, however, navigating the swamps can be a breeze, especially those few who travel through regularly. It makes for a great spot for these folks to get away to somewhere quiet, with its odd beauty and interesting sights.

Those that roam in certain places change to fit over a generation of two. My desert roaming cousins, their colour matches the sand, and their legs are stronger, sometimes clawed. The snow roamers, they have wider feet. There are many more, but those like me\u2026 we are said to be the closest to the originals.\" He pulls his hands back and rests them on her hips, firm, but gentle as before. \"Our shared history changes from Av' to Av', but these parts are generally accepted. Our parents tell us of these tales, and their parents before them. I am sure my own children will be told the same when they are of age.\" ", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Kahm gives a light chuckle as he rests his head upon her shoulder once again, his hands unmoving even as her hands press against his. Why would he? Not only are they his favoured places to rest his tired hands, but it made for a nice little moment of intimacy he hadn't entirely expected, and he had no plans to ruin it. \"Point taken, but my doting is no less true,\" he says before planting a small kiss on her cheek. \"You have taken my adoration by storm.\" "}, "post-95700": {"user": "Sibylle Kasimir Rozenwit", "user_num": 3524, "timestamp": "1582070346000", "message": "As Kasimir listened, she felt as though she were participating in a little song and dance.

Or perhaps it's something your ancestors left for you?\" The warrior swayed them from side to side, lifting each foot in turn on tiptoe. \"You also have children. Do you not wish to be with them?\" she asked, not in judgment, but curiosity. She was not keen on childbearing, herself. Not yet.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "As Kasimir listened, she felt as though she were participating in a little song and dance.

Perhaps unheard to Kas at least, as the rhythm runs through Kahm's veins like blood. The joys of being a music mage, his timing is impeccable. \"Why we change to suit our surroundings?\" He asks, then pauses for thought. \"That\u2026 is a question with no known answer. Many have tried to figure it out, but after generations they still search for that answer. One day we'll find it, gathering knowledge is something of an innate desire for us, but for now it's uncertain.\" His fingers press and stroke along Kas' skin as he speaks, enjoying the surprising softness in most places, and the intricate bumps of her scars as a contrast. \"Many do consider it to be magic, yes,\" he finally says, golden eyes staring into Kas'. \"Each one of us is highly tuned to the realm of magic, we are all born with different abilities. Myself, I channel my magic through my voice and my music.\" That much is obvious. \"My sisters are no different. My elder sister is a storm wielder, fitting for the cunning warrior she is. She can channel a storm's destructive lightning at will, and when there's a storm raging overhead\u2026 some consider her unstoppable.\" He smiles with pride as he speaks, proud of his three sisters. \"My youngest sister is likely one of the most important among my kind. She is clairvoyant and all seeing, she is the Oracle, many seek her for her advice and guidance. Though I have not seen her in many years, neither have I seen my eldest sister. That will change when our paths cross again.\"\"Perhaps out ancestors did leave us with this magic,\" he considers, hands pressing against her back and pulling her close. \"You would have to ask a historian about that, however. That, or find the Great Library of our people. You would be the first for over a thousand years.\" He chuckles at that, finding the prospect of finding said library ludicrous. It's what his people have been trying to do since the world collapsed around them. \"My children\u2026\" he says in a soft tone, but his smile doesn't falter. \"Children are considered the future of my people,\" he begins, knowing there's a culture shift between the Av'rae and most other cultures. \"And because we are few and spread, it is demanded of us that every Av's first born must be an Av', so our people and blood lines can continue. I gave two of my old friends their first borns as a result, and I do visit when I find myself near their homes, but I am no father by any other sense of the word.\" \"They do have actual fathers, however,\" he says, continuing his tale. \"One of my children's mother is married to an Orc, built like a castle but as gentle as a mouse, and a great influence for my boy. He will teach him the art of smithing, and will give him a trade for life, for this I cannot thank him enough. We always share a bottle of Orcish Ghuzig when I visit, I am very fond of him. They have given my son a sister and a brother since, both more orc than Av', but once their horns grow out it will become more apparent.\" \"The other mother travels with a human, her wife,\" he continues. \"A caravaner and an expert jeweler, she excels at her craft, as does my daughter's mother, a carpenter. They make a fine living, moving from town to town, I often see them on the road as opposed to at home, like the others.\" He gives a light, but proud sigh as he puts his forehead against Kas'. \"I may not be involved as a father, but both groups see me as family. I could not ask for more.\" Then his face lights up as he remembers something. \"If you think that is strange, I should tell you of the Joining of the Clans, that might blow your boots off.\" ", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Kahm's movements are soft and graceful as they do their gentle little dance together, swaying back and forth to an unheard rhythm.
