Quickly reaching up to settle his pack across his back before it slipped and sent him tumbling to the ground, he shook his head sadly.  All the years in his life he'd spent studying nature, learning about the natural world, tracking, hunting, living in the wilderness, and he'd managed to forget one of the most basic rules of traversing a forest.Find your compass points.Ekir's original intention had been to travel north, seeking an exit from the trees by reaching the Usque River, and then to follow the river - which would doubtless be full of fish, and surrounded by other game as well - further to the north, out of the woodlands and towards the colder plains above.  The young man had nothing better to do at the moment than wander, and was content to go wherever his feet took him; after his last position in the military, he'd decided he needed some time to himself to...sort everything out.The young cleric suppressed a shudder, but as his eyes flickered closed for a half-second, he tripped on a lizard which darted across his path.\"A-ah!\"  The stuttering cry went out, and he whoomped into the dirt, moaning softly.  \"...J-just my luck...\"  He sighed quietly, reaching a hand out to push himself up.  Curiously, the lizard did not seem offended - far from it, the small creature flicked its tongue at him, coming a few paces closer.  Ekir settled into a crouch, his golden eyes fixated on the small reptile, about the size of his forearm.\"H-hello, little friend,\" Ekir murmured.  \"What're you d-doing?  Y-y-you know you're not supposed to make friends w-with perfect strangers,\" he chuckled, smiling.  Ekir reached out his hand, and the lizard flicked its tongue again, darting away slightly, before slowly coming closer.  Finally, it crawled onto his palm, to the cleric's delighted, beaming smile.  New friend settled lightly around his arm, Ekir walked through more of the forest with a much lighter step.  Perhaps this journey wouldn't be so bad after all!  He stopped after a few hundred paces or so, lifting his nose to the air.\"...S-smoke?  In the forest?!\"  Ekir increased his pace, striding towards the source of the smell - which mixed with something that made his stomach growl, though he paid it no heed - before bursting through a large bush and into a small, open clearing.  Right next to the Usque River.Ekir's golden eyes, and the lizard's own - which, curiously, had shifted color to match Ekir's - took in the scene.  A young woman sat grilling fish next to the riverbank over a small fire, contentedly eating one as the others roasted.  Breathing a soft sigh of relief, Ekir gave a small, uncertain wave.\"H-hello?\"  He tried first, then shook himself, raising his voice a little.  \"Hello!\"The diminutive cleric narrowly avoided tripping as he clambered down the riverbank, and the lizard rewarded his jostling with a soft, annoyed flick of its tongue on his arm, and a slight hiss.  Ekir patted it gently, and it resumed its passive observation, watching the woman through slitted eyes.  As he neared, Ekir realized he was staring, and blushed slightly, forcing himself to blink.\"H-hi.  I'm Ekir.  A, uh, little l-lost.

Tana's voice echoed through his consciousness, and he struggled to retain his senses even as the nature magic raced through him.  His vision whited out, and the next thing he knew he was laying in the grass, dozens of new sensations and feelings washing over him, fighting for his attention, along with thousands of clamoring voices that nearly deafened the frightened young cleric.  He curled up with a yelp, shivering as he heard Yutin's voice in the background of the din.  The comforting words from the tiny man, although barely audible through the haze of new perceptions and almost shouting, excited voices echoing all around, did help to ground the cleric, and he reached out towards that quiet, fervent murmur as best he could.  Slowly, Ekir returned to reality.Ekir lifted his head from the grass, blinking owlishly in the deepening dusk, noting that the sun had begun to drop below the horizon.  By the riverbank, he witnessed Tana trying to clean her wound; looking down at his own hand, he noticed his palm scarred over in a small white line, the result of recent healing...and ritual wound.  Ekir frowned; although his back was covered in such lacerations, he'd never gotten a close look at them...the cleric shook his head; better to examine later.  Stepping quietly over to Yutin, he laid a hand on the man's shoulder briefly.\"My thanks,\" he murmured as he slipped past the man.  \"If that...thing...ever returns, we'll be ready.\"  He continued on to Tana, sitting himself down in the dirt next to her, watching the stream rush by as she tried to clean her cut.  Although normally ritual wounds were not deep, perhaps she'd slipped slightly, and he watched as she feebly attempted to hide the severity of the slice she'd inflicted upon herself.  Ekir's hand shot out, gently but firmly grasping her wrist and turning her palm over.The young cleric struggled not to wince, but concern clearly radiated through his gently glowing eyes, and his emotion washed over Tana - gratitude, worry, and some other turbulent, light, flickering emotion that danced at the edges of her consciousness like a song she could hear the faintest notes of.\"Let me.\" Ekir commanded gently, rising from his seat.  Moments later, he returned with his small pack, withdrawing a small bowl and several herbs and roots.  A minute or two later, he'd ground everything into a poultice that he applied with firm, gentle fingers to Tana's palm.

Ekir examined the horse as he did so, finding the creature's calm demeanor and intelligent eyes a comfort; though the man had ridden half-crazed beasts when fleeing from all manner of chaos and destruction in the past, he preferred that their current ride - especially one bearing a wounded passenger - be far more placid.  Another nod from Ekir, and he'd boosted Tana into the saddle, sliding in behind her with practiced ease.  As his chest pressed to her back, the scent of the woodlands - quiet, rushing streams; tall, unbroken foliage; the prancing fauna and rough earth - filled his nostrils, and he did his best to keep the slight blush from his face as Tana half-turned, her eyes wide and so very close.  Gently, the man slid an arm around her waist, holding her in place as he whipped at the reins.\"We'll s-see you s-soon!\"  Ekir shouted to Yutin, giving the man a small wave.  A heartbeat later, the horse sped off into the undergrowth.The creature seemed to find its way with unerring precision, traveling along a route that Ekir did little to direct.  He merely rode along, gently nudging the horse from obstacles he noticed with his keen eyesight, and most importantly ensured that Tana remained seated.  The cleric took a slow, measured breath, allowing himself to relax for a moment and enjoy the peace of the untamed wilds.  Before a battle, he knew, the air was tense and fraught with danger, as though before a thunderstorm...and yet, here, all was still, quiet, slow.

When asked how long she had lived in the Usque, she sleepily tapped his arm nineteen times to indicate the years.Her hand moved to his and squeezed to let him know she would be alright, everything would be fine. She had known the day would come when Faisine would have need of her in this way. The steed veered off the path. She angled herself a little to look at him because it was in her eyes that she knew where they were going.It was an hour into the ride that the steed took them from the same path as the others.

They were wearing armor that looked almost elvish in nature.Yutin/Nymph:There were masses moving along through the woods on either side of the river, an ethereal sight.

She felt self-conscious by that point, knowing she must look a fright at the moment. She had been about to take a bath while she had the chance, though not before she started a fire. The girl moved back to the pile of wood and then to the small pit she had dug, arranging the wood in that and tearing a part of her shift to use as kindling. Then she looked for a couple of bigger stones that she could create sparks with. \"You help?\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "She looked warily at him as he moved to pull something from his back, flinching like he was about to hit her, even going so far as cowering. But then she saw that he was giving her food. With a long moment of hesitation, she soon pounced on the food and cried while she ate. Fingers shook as they crammed the pieces of bread into her mouth so quickly she gagged a couple of times.
