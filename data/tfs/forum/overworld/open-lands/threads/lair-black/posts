A few seconds later, the evening birds began their shrills and songs; none too unnatural, but certainly worrying for their prey. In the distance, an animal cry of some kind - none of the hunters seemed to mind it.

Then - SNAP! One of the ropes gave out, and a sheep belted down the pathway without anyone trying to stop it. In response to this, a horrible, low, primordial growl... And then the tip of a huge, black claw silently poking out of the darkness. Not a moment later, the sheep were gone - three great claws, each bigger than a man, clasped the ground outside the entrance of the cave as the mighty limb smashed into the rock behind it, and dragged them bleating into nothingness; three great cleaves disturbing the dirt, snow, ice and rock where the hunter and John had been stood not minutes earlier.\u00a0A few pieces of gold were shining in the night from where the chest had been broken, and as the hunter eyed them he was the first to remember to breathe again. Collectively the hunters sighed, apparently feeling safe again. \"So you see, it is truly a beast,\" he explained. \"We're not sure how it got in there, considering that it is larger than any entrance of the cavern we have found, but it's clearly powerful enough to break out of the mountain if it needs to.

One turned back just in time to see Ralf yell into the cave's entrance, to which the hunter responded with a yell of his own: \"Get away from there!\"But it was a little too late. Though he hadn't known what he was doing, Ralf had made the mistake of riling the beast too soon after its previous outburst and the yell that was sent into the cave was suddenly replied to with a loud crash, one that caused loose rocks to crumble and fall from the mountain above the cave's opening. Inside the blackness a dim light like a distant fire grew in brightness and intensity and a second later, a super-heated jet-stream of flame shot out into the evening cold and set ablaze a dead winter tree by John Grain and the head hunter, who ducked and rolled away.\u00a0When the stream of flames ended, the night's silence was ruined by a loud, angry, reptilian scream coming from the mountain.\u00a0", "link_list": ["/user/3243", "/user/451"], "image_list": [], "html": "The hunter nodded at "}, "post-87121": {"user": "John Grain", "user_num": 3243, "timestamp": "1542641819000", "message": "The second John came back to his senses, he turned to the head hunter. \"We must hurry.\" he said, with a certain strength in his voice, \"leave your fastest men behind, they will be able to warn the villages if the dragon escapes.

You can't just wander in out of the mountain air and expect to best something that, as far as we know, has been kept there for good reason. Did the ancient mountain dwellers lock the beast within stone, or did it sleep there and grow until it could no longer leave? We don't actually know if it can leave, but we do know that if we don't give tribute then it may well try - and believe me, even from within the cave the beast can cause untold destruction down here in the valleys.
