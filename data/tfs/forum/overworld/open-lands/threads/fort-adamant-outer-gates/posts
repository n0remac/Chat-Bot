The moat follows the inside edge of the wall, and the gate is barred from the outside.\u00a0 It's almost like the fort was designed not to keep something out, but to keep something inside.Although many stop in the port town, there is very little traffic into the fort itself, though the gates hang open.\u00a0 The fort is a place of terrible reputation, the civilians most fear those terrible days when the great gates shut.\u00a0 There is always such noise.\u00a0 Like thunder from within the walls.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://orig00.deviantart.net/d91a/f/2015/142/f/c/the_lost_fortress_by_jbrown67-d8t4anz.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://orig00.deviantart.net/d91a/f/2015/142/f/c/the_lost_fortress_by_jbrown67-d8t4anz.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}, "post-79707": {"user": "Zvir", "user_num": 2871, "timestamp": "1518555167000", "message": "The travel from Lord Volkh's castle was easy going.

Rune paused for a moment, stopping the horse. His father had sent a letter with him, instructing that he not open it and give it to whoever was in command at Fort Adamant. Now, the fact that his father said not to open it of course only made him want to open it, and so he did, breaking his father's seal to read the letter's contents.To Whom it May Concern,As is tradition... I, Lord Naimus shall send my son and heir to Fort Adamant to serve, as many generations past have done, but I also ask a favor of thee, as a veteran of the fort.Rune needs to act as a proper heir of the Naimus family should, he needs to learn how to be a man. Ever since his mother...And that is where Rune stopped reading, throwing the parchment away in disgust. The letter from his father to the commander at Fort Adamant fluttered to the ground, landing in a muddy puddle near the side of the rode as Rune nudged his horse forward and continued trotting down the road.He didn't need his father's disapproval following him, or his concern. As an optimist, Rune saw this Fort Adamant thing at least as an opportunity to get away and be his own person, yet even that his father sought to take from him. He let out an exasperated sigh at the thought of it, nudging his horse from a trot to a gallop. The dreary landscape flew under him until he crested a hill, revealing Fort Adamant. Fort Adamant was only a day's ride away from Rune's home, yet he had never been to the place in his entire life. Constantly he was told about it by his family, how large and magnificent the castle was, that he would someday go there, and now here he was.Most would say he was destined to arrive here eventually, he had trained all of his life to serve here after all, but Rune didn't believe in destiny. The fort looked dreary and boring to him, despite its size. Reluctantly, he spurred his horse forward, heading towards the fort. He would soon pull up next to Zvir, galloping up on his horse from behind.Rune seemed to be not at all perturbed by the walking statue, perhaps its body language helping to put Rune at ease.\"Hello! I am Rune,\" he said, offering a dazzlingly white smile, \"Are you on the way to the fort?

Tapping its chest as if to indicate that was the target of its statement. \"We go together, Rune.\" Nailed it.
