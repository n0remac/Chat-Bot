One may be given to wonder how the owners of the Inn even manage to stay in business given outward appearances, and the fact that the Inn sits alongside a not-so-well-traveled desolate stretch of road. This particular bit of murkiness becomes clearer, however, when it is revealed that the house sits almost exactly on the half-way point between two large towns - both centers of tourism and commerce. A traveler sat astride a strong horse, or being pulled along by a team of strong horses as the case may be, could leave one town just before daylight and be at the Inn just as the sun set. Faced with the alternatives - sleeping out for the night or pushing on in the darkness - most passersby choose to stay at the Inn despite its run-down and, to some, unsettling appearance. It is for this reason that most of the Inn\u2019s customers arrive under the cover of darkness.Once inside, a patron of the Inn may find themselves thankfully surprised at the relatively good condition of the interior of the house. The dark wooden floors are a bit creaky but give a warm and inviting look to the main common area the front door opens up into. Chairs with dated upholstering look comfortable, and sit around small tables next to an equally petite bar, all positioned neatly around a stone hearth with the warm glow of a fire. The furnishings of the Inn are all well worn and universally showing their age, but they are clean and at one time (perhaps decades ago) would have cost someone a small fortune.(Find out more about this thread Here.)", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/2686/night-inn-creepy-dark-horror"], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/stjzd2l.jpg"], "html": "<p align=\"center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/stjzd2l.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/></p>"}, "post-69384": {"user": "Roxanne Fletcher", "user_num": 472, "timestamp": "1497151813000", "message": "Roxanne rode up to the inn, checking the worn note in her hand.

No sign of a cellar really was odd. Even the family estate had a cellar, although it was used more for wine than for root vegetables. Still, perhaps the cellar had been hidden. What purpose would a hidden cellar serve, though? To hide a kidnapped girl, maybe? However, her speculation was cut short by a very cross Mr. Borden bursting in. She stood by quietly as he shouted at Mr. Merrit, and went back to brushing her horse when he went back in. Of course the proprietor knew what was up, she'd been stupid to not realize earlier. If he really did know anything, it would be awfully difficult to get him to spill. Still, she figured that she may as well try her best. After a brief search for any sign of horse-stealing ruffians, she headed back inside and returned to the bar to finish her drink.

She could understand the struggle, having gone through something similar herself. Sipping at her drink, she leaned against the countertop.\"I can imagine what you're going through, Mr. Borden. When I was younger, my friend Dixie's father was stabbed in his home. The only witness said that they saw someone with white hair fleeing the scene. All of my family has white hair like mine, so people were constantly in and out of the estate. We were constantly being questioned, accused, and threatened for months on end. It was awful, and people kept throwing rocks at our windows and sneaking in to search for evidence. Eventually, it turned out that it wasn't any of my family at all, just an old man who Mr. Weaver had won one too many games of cards against. He figured that he was old enough that he had nothing to lose. Poor Dixie.\"She sighed, sipping at her drink. Perhaps the premature death of her father had something to do with Dixie's behavior when she'd gotten older. Dixie was one of Roxanne's best friends, but even she couldn't deny that the girl deserved the nickname \"Shortcake\". Roxanne wasn't sure who came up with the name, but it definitely fit. Dixie was short, sweet, and everybody in town had gotten a piece.\"I'm sure you've got nothing to do with it, Mr. Borden. It's a shame that Mr. Bluff named this place as the only lead.

Twice a year, she would make the trip from Glendale over to Hickory Point on her father's behalf, and on her trip to and from she'd stay here for the night. It'd been that way for a number of years now.\" Mr. Borden leaned back in his chair, his index finger gently tracing the dainty handle of his cup of tea.\"Delilah - Miss Bluff - had trouble sleeping through the night; a proclivity the girl had for not being able to sleep in a strange bed, no matter how comfortable she was.\u00a0When\u00a0mother was in better health, she and Miss Bluff wiled away the night with tea, and talked. Miss Bluff would relay stories from her father's travels, and mother would tell her stories from when she was a little girl.

Mother, in her illness, is confused\u00a0a great portion\u00a0of the time, and I am concerned that she may mistake you for her. I wouldn't bother mentioning it if not for the fact that in earlier years. when my father was alive, he and mother used to take moonlit walks together.\u00a0Lately, mother, in her confusion, has resumed taking these walks at night - by herself you understand. I would consider it a personal favor that if for whatever reason she approaches you, you would not ask her about Miss Bluff's disappearance. I'm doing all that I can to keep it from her, she simply does not need the stress in the condition.\"Borden sipped his tea looking over at Roxanne.\"Just so you understand, Miss Fletcher, I am not asking you to play as if you are Miss Bluff, only to not mention her disappearance. I only mean to warn you that she may mistake you for the girl she had a friendship with, and to ask you not to distress her needlessly in her fragile condition.
