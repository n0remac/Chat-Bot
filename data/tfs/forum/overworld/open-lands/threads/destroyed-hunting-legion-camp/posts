She would try and pull free from the two dragging her along a couple times as they made their way to the camp, though the pain in her shoulder in the absence of adrenaline made these attempts quite futile. Most likely she had broken a bone or two in her shoulder, she figured.\u00a0<exit>Surprisingly, Arya Shieldheart \u2019s trip to wherever the bandits had taken camp was rather short, considering they made it there without any major delays or stopping for breaks in just under a day, and now the sun was beginning to set in the west, casting an orange light upon the local forest. Arya\u2019s weak struggles would only be met with a grunt from her carriers as they pulled her along the ground, further towards their destination.Eventually the passing by trees would abruptly end, and soon they came to the outskirts of a walled camp. Stumps of once trees littered outside the encampment, except for in front of a small gate and trail leading out of it, which was likely the main entrance to the compound. Before they moved them and their prisoner inside though, they stopped outside of the gate, tossing Arya Shieldheart \u2019s back against the remains of a fallen tree. The seemingly next in command (after @mirssa ) stepped forward, a gnoll with very bloodstained gear and fur for once addressed their captive.In very poor common and perhaps a sarcastic tone as well, he gave her important instructions as he stood over the prisoner.\u00a0\u201cAll rite miss, if ya wanna make it through \u2018ere with out anything else bad happenin\u2019 to yah, you best be quiet.

She still wore the bracelet given to her by Madam Naoki some time ago at the Chalet in the mountains, underneath her plate armor.It hadn\u2019t come to mind to her captors that she may have had an injury from the previous fight, they didn\u2019t know about it, and continued to treat her as if she only had sores and bruises. Aye, her blade was indeed still near her, in one of the trailing bandit\u2019s knapsacks; the point of it barely stuck through the cheap cloth of the bag. The Legion troops were awfully glad for their anti-magic rope, as it was their only real defense against the paladin\u2019s powers, but once they got to the main tent there would shamans and other casters who could fight her magical powers, if she got free\u2026Pleased with her quiet and quick response, the commanding gnoll went to take the lead again, and then two other bandits grabbed her from under the shoulder again, hoisting her back up and started to drag her towards the gate. As they went down the mere muddy road and past the wooden wall, it appeared that inside was a rather large settlement that was supposed to only be temporary, but had remained long past it\u2019s expected deconstruction. It was lain out like a urban city, with dark alleys between tents and small log buildings. No sewer systems or aqueducts, or really any hygiene based structures were established inside its boundaries. The result was a very bad smell throughout the encampment. Whether these bandits did not care for the stench, or were just too lazy to keep it clean, one of them was the likely reason. Besides the strong smell of raw/rotting meat and excrement, the structures throughout were poorly made and worn down. Most buildings were simply tents, all at fixed heights no higher than the walls. There were few log buildings, but those appeared to be buildings of importance to these creatures.As Arya Shieldheart was dragged towards the center of the camp, a goblin tending a fire off to the side had caught the group escorting Arya. He eagerly approached the side of them, but the group would shove him off.\u201cWut you got dere? Some eatz, or sumthin\u2019 bettar?\u201dThe gnoll didn\u2019t looked too pleased to be speaking to this goblin.\u201cNuffin\u2019 for ya, that\u2019s fer sure.

Also a tent, but partly constructed and reinforced with logs, it stood high than it\u2019s surrounding buildings. The leader walked into Arya Shieldheart\u2019s view.\u201cOkay, you ought to be just az nice az you were gettin\u2019 down here. Cuz if you ain\u2019t as nice lookin\u2019 and useful as you were a wee bit back, you\u2019ll be dead, and maybe I will too.

Gah, just take her armor off, cut da strapz if ya need too. Maybe jus break \u2018er other shoulder, make em look even!\u201dHe laughed at his own joke, then proceeded to keep watch as his men started to unbuckle or cut any chunks of plate  off that weren\u2019t stuck. Any padding or underarmor would remain untouched, as they only wanted to tear off the heavy metal parts first. All the metal armor from Arya\u2019s upper torso, arms and her helm would be removed, as the bandit threw the pieces into two separate bags. Once her gear was collected up, they proceeded carrying her as normal to the front entrance. It didn\u2019t look as if they cared about her injury right now, hopefully they would care at some point.As they dragged their loot (woman included) to the door, there stood two heavily armored Legion troops guarding the only entrance. One was presumably a gnoll (who was massive compared to the rest of their race) and a orc. Neither of their faces were visible through all the random metals put together that was their helmet. They each wielded a halberd, but shortened for easier use. They crossed their weapons in front of the log doorway as the orc confronted the approaching band of warriors.\u201cOi, wut you wahnt? Legion Master Zhax isn\u2019t expectin\u2019 you!\u201dIt was quite clear it was very hard to see through all the junk in front of his face, he'd be lucky if he could see anything more than just through a tiny hole.Now being spoken to, the gnoll once again took the head of the warriors.\u201cWe got sum loot and this lady from an attack, we jus\u2019 here to report to mister bossman.\u201d\u201cHmm, alright. You dere, go check if it\u2019s ok fer them to go in!\u201dHe pointed with his free hand at his fellow guard whom she nodded her head and went through the curtain door. The heavy clanking of armor was heard through the door, but any voices were either too soft to hear or in a foreign, brutish dialect of a tongue that Arya Shieldheart has not learned.

Soon the chatter beyond the cloth door would end, and the thumping of heavy armor would become louder as the guard returned. She pushed through the hanging sheets and took her position where she was originally stationed at before speaking through her helmet.\u201cYou\u2019re all gud to go in, bring \u2018er inside as well.\u201dBoth halberds were lifted out of their way, and they were cleared to go inside the tent.The leading gnoll went first through the doorway, as expected, and second were the two carrying Arya Shieldheart . Once through the doorway, Arya would likely first see that this building was indeed floored, as she was now resting on a dark and damp rotting wood floor, the second part she would notice is that the inside of the building had a softer light blue color lighting the room, unlike the rest of the camp who were using conventional flames to see. The blue light came from two moderately sized magical braziers which were burning a unique flame, resting to the left and right of a tall wood and leather seat. Upon what one might call the center throne, was Legion Master Zhax , whom was currently adorned in armor similar of the rest of his troops, but the individual pieces seemed of higher quality and of rarer metals. He had no helm or neck armor on at this time, and it was visible that there was a clean bandage wrapped beneath his chin and all the way back up and across the top of his head. The Kiggy slouched in his seat with such posture that suggested he was better than everyone in this very room. To the left and the right of his shoddy throne and behind the magic braziers were what looked of two magic users or shamans, as each was dressed in strange feathers, cloths and jewelry. The goblin and kobold each seemed to tend to the flame on their respective side, but were also watching the people who had just entered the rather large room.The leader stepped to the front and center of the room and took a knee infront of Legion Master Zhax  before speaking; the others behind him followed suit as well, Arya Shieldheart  was released in the center of the room, but each of her guards remained next to her to make sure she wouldn\u2019t try anything, not that she was in a position to escape at this point\u2026\u201cLegion Master Legion Master Zhax , we were stationed along a road, an\u2019 @mirssa  was leadin\u2019 dis, and we came across a large wagon. As you requested, we tried taking it for ourselves but there was a magik usin\u2019 halfling who killed a bunch of our guyz and @mirssa . We managed to git a few valuables before trying to chase down a gnome on the run, but then we were interrupted\u2026\u201d He gestured with his hand that Arya Shieldheart  was that unfortunate \u201cinterruption.\u201d\u201cShe went and dun killed a few of us before we struck \u2018er down, but we saw that she \u2018ad some gud stuff and was a magic person, so we brought her to you.\u201dLegion Master Zhax , now sat up in his seat a bit before responding to his minion. His voice didn\u2019t seem too intimidating, but it did seem more guttural and hardened than the rest of his kin.\u201cI see, and so you fled with wat little you had and this caster?\u201dThe gnoll lifted his head.\u201cYeah, we did.\u201dLegion Master Zhax  hopped down from his seat and started to walk towards the leader, but then went around him and to Arya Shieldheart . He went by her and reached out his scaly hand, stroking against the side of her soft cheeks. Those eyes seemed familiar to Legion Master Zhax , like someone who he had spent time with a while ago\u2026Still partially grabbing the side of her beautiful face and lifting it up, he uttered questions to her as the rest of his bandits waited in silence.\u201cMy dearie girl, might I ask who yeh are, and where do you belong?

She could probably even deal with the camp herself if she managed to not be interrupted by their anti-magic long enough.Of course they always had to try and fight, they never would give up easily. He withdrew his hand from her face for the moment, seeing as she was being a little stubborn brat. Her anger and resolve only seemed to fuel Legion Master Zhax  's drive to toy with her. While it was no question that Isra could easily overpower the Legion, but they had tricks to not being crushed.

He began to circle around Arya Shieldheart   and moved behind her.\"Now listen here my dearie Arya.\"He grabbed a fistful of her hair, pulling her head back as he started to undo her braids.\"I'm in control in this place, and you are mine, no one will be able to take you away, at least alive. And if you don't wanna end up used and murdered on a roadside, then I suggest you do as I command.\"Should she try and resist his actions, he could easily tug a little harder on her scalp to convince her to loosen up a bit.\"Now tell meh, what do ya do fer Isra and why were one of you city lovers all the way out in my territory meddling in my affairs?\" He softly spoke in her ear, as he continued to unthread her hair", "link_list": ["/post/61555/thread", "/user/997", "/user/710", "/user/997", "/user/710", "/user/997", "/user/997"], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/0sD8VZ6.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@fletcherornah\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/61555/thread\" timestamp=\"1489623988\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-997\" title=\"Arya Shieldheart\"><img alt=\"Arya Shieldheart Avatar\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/0sD8VZ6.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/61555/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1489623988000\" title=\"Mar 15, 2017 16:26:28 GMT -8\">Mar 15, 2017 16:26:28 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-997 group-0\" href=\"/user/997\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@fletcherornah\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Arya Shieldheart</span></a></span> said:</div>Once the two had led Arya inside\u00a0and let her go, she would, of course, fall to the ground, having still been tied up.

He continued to listen to her story as he began to circle back around to her front, pacing and inspecting her as she spoke. The fact she had served in an army as a mage, and then traveled, on foot as far as he could tell, led Legion Master Zhax to believe that while obviously his minions hadn\u2019t snatched up some one of direct royalty or importance, she seemed to play a critical enough role as to where she may actually have some potential ransomers. Or perhaps she would benefit them more as a slave healer for the rest of her life? He wasn\u2019t going to make a decision yet, but it was worth choosing sooner than later.There was a pause as she finished her story, but then she brought up the status of her shoulder and how she wanted to heal it. Legion Master Zhax, now in front of her, considered her offer.\u201cHmmm\u2026\u201dHe turned to look at her again, Arya Shieldheart\u2019s shoulder did seem swollen and dislocated, even through her clothes. But he knew better, he easily suspected it as a quick way for her to try and make her escape. He shook his head. Not this time.\u201cI think not, I will have someone heal it, when I think you are deserving of being kept alive longer.

Her shoulder wasn't actually going to kill her on it's own.While it hadn\u2019t quite dawned on Legion Master Zhax that she might have smaller magical trinkets still on her person and under her clothes, but all that would likely end up being removed and eventually found. He continued to circle around her figure again, then stopped behind her once again. The fact she had connections to Lady Naoki signified that she may have importance to Isra, but what type of use she served, was still unknown. It seemed unlikely that Arya Shieldheart is just a pawn to Naoki, but it was a possibility, and he didn\u2019t want to protect himself with collateral that Isra could easily live without. The fact she was allied with a dragon did spark a fright with Legion Master Zhax, but the fact that they had Arya Shieldheart as a captive was hopefully enough protection to stop a dragon from attacking them when among the bandits was their friend. The member of LTS didn\u2019t particularly ring any bells, but supposed it could prove to be useful.\u201cSo you aren\u2019t jus\u2019 a random out to and try an\u2019 shut me down solo.

Holding it firm, he drew a dagger from its holder into his free hand, and slashed at her neck\u2026\u2026 cutting her blonde white hair short, about shoulder length. Hopefully this was enough proof for anyone in Isra to make out that this was Arya. He released his grip on the remains of her poorly trimmed hair, and stuck the now severed threads in a pouch of his. As he put his dagger back in it\u2019s small sheathe, he came back around to her front, just so he could clear things up with her.\u201cSo you\u2019re tellin\u2019 meh, that you\u2019re worth more to Isra, then to us?

A verbal and a horn alarm was spread through the camp, as the bandits slowly merged into their units within their walls. The Legion\u2019s engineers began to assemble roughly a dozen scorpion turrets near the center of the camp grounds. From their position, they could bombard the horsemen while they were atop the hill. They lacked calvary of their own, but had plently of spearmen, archers, slingers, light and medium infantry. Wooden stakes around the gate and near the walls could deter their cavalry from riding directly up to their fortifications, and taking them by surprise. 360 degree patrols were still in effect, as to make sure no one would unexpectedly come from their flanks. The camp\u2019s spare shamans and other magic users banded together, and channeled magic cooperatively. The troops would remain within their defensive structure and behind the gateway, forcing the cavalry to close the gap and sacrifice their speed in the close quarters camp. None of them attacked yet or were given orders to, as it did seem the people on the hill were some sort of raiders as well. If they came raiding for loot, there wasn\u2019t much here, at least not yet. Hopefully they could explain themselves under some sort of \u201cbandit\u2019s code\u201d before any fighting occurred. The camp was at full strength, after Nat'ia \u2019s group had returned from Aozora recently to bolster the encampment fighting effectiveness.Arya Shieldheart  might notice an increase of movement and yelling all of a sudden, but it was unclear to her what might have been cause for this much ruckus.

She put away what leftover cloth she had without a sound, into the back room and returned back to the magic fire, quickly shuffling towards it to relieve her other comrade so he could maintain his own.The Guard who was sent to collect supplies for Arya Shieldheart returned, with a bundle of dirty blankets, robes, and faded cloths in one hand, and a bucket of water. He chucked the fabrics behind the fire-tenders and onto the damp wood floor, next to Legion Master Zhax's makeshift throne. That was presumably where Arya Shieldheart was going to have to spend this night.The other Guard who stayed looked at the one who just returned to see if he had an answer as to what exactly was going on outside.\"I dunno yet, but we iz to stay 'ere. If she triez runnin' or someone triez to save her, run her through or split her neck open. That's our orderz.\"She nodded to what the other guard had told her, and they both resumed positions after the one who'd brought the water walked past Arya Shieldheart to set it down next to the bundle of cloths at the base of Legion Master Zhax's seat.The armored one who had stayed to guard now talked to Arya Shieldheart from the doorway, not only to help keep her calm, but also hopefully to distract her from any thoughts of escaping.\"You jus stay right dere and we won't have a problem, miss.

Even to you humies, that must be bad.

Soon they heard the approaching voice of Legion Master Zhax, who was speaking in a tongue they could understand. He was addressing someone else across from the building they were in. Meanwhile, under her cover Arya Shieldheart would slowly be able to slip off the bindings across her wrists. The guards were looking for cutting or sawing motion across her hands, not wiggling. They figured her fidgeting was Arya trying to get her hands to rest more comfortably. However, the rope across her ankles still remained, blocking her anti-magic, and also preventing her from moving her legs apart. Undoing or cutting those would prove much higher suspicion and would be a lot more awkward to free herself. It was likely to provoke the guards into checking her, which if they found her wrists undone, she'd be in deep trouble.

Arya would begin to wiggle one of her hands out of her gauntlets and the armor on her arm, as the ropes were tied over them.

Legion Master Zhax  eyed the strange demonic creatures behind Kharn, Champion of Wrath , until the mighty chests they were carrying had caught his eye. Money, and lots of it. But Legion Master Zhax  just didn\u2019t want money, he wanted stuff to help him during the thrill of the hunt, when they run down any fleeing victims, he wanted weapons, armor, and the like as well. The small insult within his speech did stir his emotions a little, but it would not show. He started to rub the bottom of his jaw thinking about what had just been brought before him, when Kharn mentioned the prisoner, Arya Shieldheart . Of course there was more to this than bringing simple gifts, it always had to be complicated in some way. His messenger from the Isranians had returned recently, saying that they were interested in negotiating a price for the paladin as well. What if they made a more suitable or favorable offer? Legion Master Zhax  didn\u2019t expect it as a threat, if Kharn, Champion of Wrath  would notice if he looked around was that he was surrounded on all sides, the previously quivering guards had rallied at the sight and the voice of their leader, leaving no room for any clean escapes. Shamans stood behind Legion Master Zhax \u2019s melee line behind him ready to cast any sort of minor spells, not to mention, Kharn and his troops were heavily outnumbered by the sheer amount of nearby low-quality bandits.Legion Master Zhax  thought for a moment, before starting to slowly pace in front of his troops.\u201cWhile I am always most happy to accept such gifts and make such\u2026 alliances, why\u2019d ya seek me out?\u201d Legion Master Zhax  now turned one hundred and eighty degrees as he slowly stepped the other way, now addressing the most critical concern of the paladin.\u201cWhy? What does your Lord hope to gain from her? Besides, the Isranians have already offered to parley for her safe return, but\u2026\u201dHe takes a moment to turn and face Kharn directly.\u201cIf you can offer me a greater prize than the Isranians, I\u2019ll be most certainly joyed to surrender her over to you instead\u2026 Oh, and I wouldn\u2019t try taking her by force, by the time you\u2019d be able to find her, she\u2019ll be in more than fifty pieces scattered about this local soil. The Isranians wouldn\u2019t take it too kindly if you or your leader happened to be the cause of the death of their prized maiden.\u201dIn agreement and perhaps acknowledgement of his words, the army surrounding Kharn, Champion of Wrath  would all bang their weapons and shields and jeer almost simultaneously.For Arya Shieldheart , the inside of the tent remained mostly the same, the two magic blue flames could be physically seen fading, a dark evil and red flame began to be visible near the base of the fire. Arya wouldn\u2019t be able to make anything usable out of Legion Master Zhax \u2019s conversation, but the ending thump of arms was clear as a drum beat.

How much? He didn't know. But he sure as hell didn't like how Kharn, Champion of Wrath    was acting, and debated giving the order to surround and crush his forces. Legion Master Zhax   didn't move from his spot, until the creaking of wheels and trotting of horses came from behind Kharn.The Isranian calvary would push their way past the rear of the circle, had the spear men been facing the right way or had heard the horses sooner, they would've turned to impale the mounted units. They scrambled out of the way of the armored wagon, trying not to be crushed, and when it halted, a single man of high status emerged. Josef Zemp  , the one that Nit described as who he had spoken too, now introduced himself to the bandit leader. Looking back for only a split second, and gesturing with his free hand, Legion Master Zhax   signaled two troops in the rear to fetch Arya Shieldheart  . He had an idea.\u201cNo, no, here's my offer\u2026\u201dLegion Master Zhax    jumped back, between his pike, spear, and pole axe men as they took a step forward in front of their leader, with weapons raised at Kharn, Champion of Wrath  . Should he try to slash at Zhax or attack him, he would find his weapon meeting a disposable cheap minion of hundreds, as more than 10 different  pole arms from multiple directions would jab into every chink of his heavy armor. Shamans stood at the ready far behind Zhax, preparing to cast a field of antimagic should the need arise. Now in relative safety, Legion Master Zhax   could finish speaking to Kharn, Champion of Wrath  .\u201cKill the Isranians, I'll give you the girl, free of charge. All I want is the loot left from the slain. Otherwise, I'm giving her to them.\u201dHis rough, unpleasant voice got louder, to address Josef Zemp  , whom was farther away.\u201cYes, indeed you did. No worries though. We're going to get this settled. Kill the demonic scum, and you'll have your paladin!\u201d He smiled and mentally rubbed his hands together, his will be fun. All weapons in the surrounding circle were at the ready, but they did not attack either side yet, if one side tried killing the Legion, they'd be attacked. Arya Shieldheart   could hear most of the commotion happening outside. It was interrupted with the quick walk of guards, as they entered and seized her from under the armpits. They dragged her through the doors outside and behind Legion Master Zhax  \u2019s line of units. Shamans with antimagic flanked Arya Shieldheart , should her ropes be split, come undone or somebody tries rescuing her. It was hard to see past them, but she could certainly see most of Legion Master Zhax   and glimpses of the demons.Jun of the Celadine  \u2019s small growing magic plant, remained unnoticed by anyone in the camp, for now.((Jun of the Celadine   and Wah Doobie  , I'll post to you separately.))(I'll edit this later on my PC, it was written on my clunky new phone which has some dumb autocorrects.

The horses stamp and nicker as their riders lower their massive lances towards the enemy. Easily reaching five metres in length, the lance was just the first of many weapons in the service of the Isran heavy cavalry. The cavalrymen begin chanting a low mantra, building up their fervor for the coming fight. As he takes position behind the heavy ballista mounted atop the wagon, Zemp calls out to his demonic compatriot, \"We are with you, sir!\" The ballista fires, letting loose a shaft towards one of the shamans.The Isran heavy cavalry charges forward towards Zhax as their riders let out high pitches whoops. In the center of the wedge, one rider cradles his lance in one arm and sounds his clarion horn twice. The formation accelerates carefully, each rider maintaining their position in the wedge perfectly. Zemp hauls himself back into the safety of the wagon, slamming closed the small hatch leading to the roof.

It seemed that he had overestimated how valuable this paladin was, and as Kharn, Champion of Wrath      had stated, Legion Master Zhax     \u2019s odds of leaving here alive were pretty slim, but even worse, was Arya Shieldheart     \u2019s.The Isranian cavalry charge would prove to be a rather sacrificial attack. While their lances could out range most of the Legion's weapons (excluding the small mix of pike men scattered in the lines) casualties would amount heavily on both sides. The spear was the most common weapon in the Legion's arsenal, but the Israns could reach them first before being struck. But on the left, right and behind every member was another body, who would easily skewer the rider or their horse as they pierced the first bandit on their weapon. The horsemen\u2019s formation would indeed somewhat push the bandits\u2019 line apart, but with little room to gain good speed for a charge and with the repelling point of pole arms, it refused to be broken through, as more units from the rear piled into the fighting. The two wedges of cavalry would be stopped in their tracks by the sheer amount of bodies and anti-cavalry weapons.The wheeled medieval \u201ctank\u201d that was Josef Zemp     \u2019s would be the main cause for concern for the Legion's line. Charging straight up the middle of the Legion's formation, it faced the heaviest resistance. Luckily, the armored wagon would not be able to gain much speed before the pulling horses were speared and likely killed without hesitation. The dirty creatures would jump out of the way of its path, others who were not so lucky, would be knocked down or ran over. Without enough force to effectively plow through the light infantry line, the wagon was quickly surrounded on its front and sides. Without any real means of damaging the wagon, the troops began to slowly pass up a small barrel of oil. For now, shield men boxed the wagon in on three sides and defended themselves.The shaman of the ballista\u2019s target was covered by troops, even with the slightly higher elevation, it was an unclear target. The giant bolt pierced multiple infantry in front of the magic user, before connecting with the shaman. However, due to the poor angle and fodder in front of him, the shaman would be knocked aside and onto the ground by the passing projectile, interrupting his magic casting and concentration.Kaylie Imrahil     \u2019s position would remain completely concealed, as there was too much commotion to try and make out a single archer in the distance. Her shot flew true and provided better results than the ballistae. The shaman would end up with an arrow through her neck, as she clutched at her throat before collapsing near Legion Master Zhax      and Arya Shieldheart     . While Kaylie Imrahil      may have been a good shot, due to the distance of the target and movement, her arrow landed not exactly where she wanted, but effect was the same. She remained unaffected by the any enemies, for now.@fletcherornah   \u2019s plan was a go, as she whacked one of the guards and he recoiled, giving her a short moment to slip her hands out from her restraints and dive forward as the guard just barely missed grabbing her again. Now she laid over the ground, still tied by her feet and surrounded by Legion units on all sides, whom were just taking notice that the Paladin was trying to escape. From between the ranks out stepped Legion Master Zhax     , his dagger in his right hand. Before she could try scrambling away, he quickly stomped his right foot down on her left wrist, without any mercy for her bones as he crushed them between his armored boot. Assuming she held still, with his empty hand Legion Master Zhax      grabbed Arya Shieldheart      by her freshly cut hair and pulled her head back, then reached down to press his sharpened dagger against the side of her neck, very eager to kill her. In almost a whisper, his rough voice was heard behind Arya Shieldheart     .\u201cLook where you die, your \u2018friends\u2019 care nothing of you, unless they stop fighting now, we will all die, and for what? They only thirst for war and blood for fun, no one gains anything from this, only losses.\u201dIf Arya Shieldheart   did not get pinned by Legion Master Zhax   \u2019s foot or tried to resist, he would crouch down to drive his dagger through her unarmored back and through her heart. Should she dodge or if Legion Master Zhax      was interrupted, the 8 other bandits surrounding the human would not hesitate to follow Legion Master Zhax   \u2019s example by impaling, slicing, chopping or crushing Arya Shieldheart      along her exposed back, with the intent to end her life swiftly.The metallic crawl of Inspector Zurt    from the rear of the wagon became audible to those nearby, the bandits on the left and right of the wagon tried to rush the steel creature to attack him as soon as the door flipped open. It seemed though, that because of whatever metal Inspector Zurt    holder was made of, their lighter weapons likely would not inflict damage. It seemed like hammers, maces, and axes would do substantial damage. However, the first wave was hit with the giant whip, killing some outright, but the lucky others were sent backwards by the huge weapon. The remainder of the troops from the first hit got in close, aiming to stab or crush the normal weak points of creatures. Joints, the neck, and the kidneys.As the fighting began, Kharn, Champion of Wrath      would find his troops being charged from behind, occupying and entangling his demons in melee. The troops were much less eager to fight these demons head on, especially with not as many numbers as they would like against the terrifying beasts. Troops from the sides rushed around Kharn, Champion of Wrath      to envelope and attack him, primarily wielding anti-armor weapons like maces and great hammers. Jun of the Celadine     was finally noticed by troops near the rear. Archers scattered throughout the camp began to take aim and let loose some arrows. It be hard to hit Jun of the Celadine     or her mount, but they were close, as Jun could occasionally hear the whizz of an arrow or bolt.The scouts now knew that battle was in the camp, they had to get away from here.\u201cDon't worry, but we gotta go.\u201dThe leading kobold picked up Wah Doobie    despite any struggles, and scattered into the forest with the rest of his unit.<Exit with Wah Doobie   >((Due to the Passing of Time rule and the impatience of Arya Shieldheart , I'll make a scenario/another post in regards to Arya in which Arya Shieldheart  escapes unharmed.

The environment was draining.But she had to stop at some point - she could smell something else on the air besides the wet land. And something was in the distance, like a settlement. Perhaps a camp? She could see tent tops out of the mass of figure on the horizon.The idea of meeting more strangers in strange lands was unsettling. She could only stand still for the moment to consider her options.Among the wet forest, @ketsueki would see the occasional wandering wildlife stand still for only a moment before either returning to their underground den, or scurrying away in some underbrush after spotting her, or another disturbance. As she came closer to the campsite, she may find an occasional patrol of 4-5 gnolls, goblins, kobolds and the like, smaller quicker creatures that were generally considered scum to more civilized races, but a distinct lack of any human looking figures. From afar, they seemed to appear like no other soldiers or war parties. They carried no banners, nor had any sort insignia or clean set of identifying colors that matched. Clearly some sort of roguish party was entrenched here on these grounds.@ketsueki could try to approach or communicate to one of these outer patrols, or she could choose to approach the wooden palisade and either make her way around to the makeshift gate, or attempt to sneak in without permission, for whatever reason. For the moment, she had time to think about an approach. These patrols clearly weren\u2019t eagle-eyed.

It was drawn tight, a little too much after she wriggled and twisted her hand to test the hold.

Skin blistering heat emanated from the spell upon the bandits below. Their hair would burn and skin melt leaving only the strongest alive. Red and gold light shimmered together above the flames of the camp making it a picture of hell. Abruptly the golden light disappeared leaving only fire below. A golden beacon shone in the sky as silence blanketed the land. The darkness above intensified as the meteor broke through the clouds, making the light from the Hunting Legion burn all the brighter. Judgement had come too late for the damned. Gods and wardens had no place in hell where demons ruled. The meteor would not hit the ground yet. Rather it collided with the pentagram and was teleported away in a flash of red and gold light. Fol-lu would not be allowed to flee from the scene of his own destruction. He had stayed for the fight and was now in it. Right in front of the feathered beast, the pentagram reappeared and a flaming meteor burst forth retaining its previous speed.
