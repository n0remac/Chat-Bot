He was settled next to the daughter of the Lord and on his other side was a young man who seemed too frightened to even speak at the table lest his manners fail him. Therefore he took to teasing the woman who\u2019d brought him there and made sure his foot was propped up underneath the table. \u201cDo all your patients get monitored through their next meal?\u201d Fianna:She tilted her head and gave a strange look, \"I am not sure what you mean by that,\" she fibbed. Of course she knew what he meant... Her father was trying mightily to find a match for her and she had turned down several would-be suitors already since coming of age. She stabbed at a piece of grouse with her eating dagger and put it into her mouth, chewing daintily. Bart:Bart grinned but chose not to call her out on what he believed to be a lie. Him questioning her would only make her calm up even farther and for some reason he was enjoying teasing her, \u201cThey sat you next to me so I can only assume it\u2019s to make sure I don\u2019t choke on my food considering how clumsy I\u2019ve already been.\u201d Fianna\"Oh please, we both know why you were put next to me. It was so my father could make you listen to me warble.\" She gave a laugh. The girl had such a pretty and wam laugh, not a twitter like a bird like a lot of ladies... more like a bubbling brook. \"Prepare for me to treat you for bloodied ears, friend.\" Bart:Her laughter reminded him of home. It was an odd reminder to be here and think of the way the trees danced, of how they sang to one another, and of how the river flowed so smoothly over stone. It made him reconsider what he would say next and with his grin slowly returning he scooted his chair over the noise drawing attention. \u201cSorry,\u201d he apologized to the room before looking back to her, \u201cLooks like there is no easy escape with these chairs as solid as they are,\u201d he was fighting in laughter at his own embarrassment. Fianna:She gave an indulgent smile, nibbling on her bread hungrily but as ladylike as possible. The girl wasn't really saving face for him, she was sure he would laugh if she ate the way a pig did... but her father was watching the pair of them after hearing the laughter, a rare noise from his daughter, and the chair scraping. \"They are made of good, solid wood,\" she said. \"Ugh, he is watching,\" she continued in a lower voice so only he could hear. Bart:He\u2019d taken a bite after his incident with the chair. Most men might have followed her look and immediately taken to looking at her father with a curiosity to ascertain what she said, but Bart didn\u2019t. He looked to her as she lowered her voice, he leaned down a little towards her and said, \u201cWell I mean I am fairly funny looking and seeing as I\u2019m clean now he can get a better look.\u201d Fianna:And when he was clean, she thought, he was very good looking... almost too good looking. But she musn't let him know that, hmm? \"Funny eh? I wouldn't say that.\" But she did not elaborate. She dropped her gaze then and cleared her throat. Bart:He drew back up scratching his beard as she cleared her throat. He had a hard time keeping his grin off of his face, something about her made him want to smile, \u201cWell what would you say then?\u201d Fianna:\"Now wouldn't you like to know?\" Was this flirting? Yes. Yes it was. And when she realized it, she stiffened a little, giving him the side eye and then as if to prevent him from getting another answer from her, she stuffed bread into her mouth. Her father frowned at her... nay, scowled. It had looked like it was going so well. Bart:He laughed at that one, the kind of laughter that sparked it in others with such a deep vibrato within it. \u201cOnly if you\u2019re willing to tell me,\u201d he ended it with he took a bite of his own bread, equally as large smiling with his mouth closed through it teasing her again. Fianna:\"I think you're going to forget all about what I think in time.\" She said this cooly, that wall of defense going up. No, she mustn't relax around him, it would only bring trouble. She had people to take care of, animals too, and the thought of being forced out of her home in some arranged marriage left a nasty taste in her mouth. It sickened her that her father knew nothing of the man he was now flaunting her to. \"So whatever it is I say that could possibly cater to your ego or deflate it matters not at all.\" Bart:Bart recognized defense, enjoyed it even when it was presented as a challenge, but hers was not one he saw as that. He saw it as a motion to protect herself in a manner in which only she knew how. \u201cYes and no,\u201d he told her the gentleness in his tone lacking all humor it once had, \u201cI will not forget your kindness, how you stopped to help a stranger upon the road without a second thought, and that healing takes up your thoughts. It is a rare person Fianna that gives without expecting to take in return.\u201d He respected her wishes returning to the meal if she chose not to speak further but he was not lying, he would remember her. Fianna:\"Oh please,\" she shot back automatically... \"I am not the only healer in this world and I am sure I am not the only person to show kindness to others. You needed help, I helped. It was nothing.\" She acted as if she was as unremarkable as they came. \"You will forget me--\" she was interrupted by her father gesturing toward the instruments. She shook her head and stood up with a whisper of silk. The scent of herbs and flowers drifted subtly about her, he may or may not smell it over the smell of grouse. Bart:When she stood his gaze rose to her. She may have been flushed with anger, or pale with disdain, but no matter the expression she chose in that moment he knew she was a fighting woman. A woman that would not go down easily and he was not the man to break down defenses when he could not rebuild them. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re right,\u201d he allowed her, \u201cI\u2019ve been known to be wrong before.\u201d In two days time he\u2019d be gone, back on the road to home, and his life wasn\u2019t the kind he could submit a woman to. Fianna:She didn't respond with anything but a look. That look spoke volumes... it wasn't a look of anger, but a look that made a complete liar out of her as far as her interests... She was into him. If he caught the little bit of a look before she turned away, he would probably get it. Fia sat with her lap harp and started to pluck several notes, looking toward her father who gave her a pointed nod. Soon, the notes of a lullubye came out of her mouth and she had such a sweet voice that it easily silenced the rest of the room and all eyes soon were on her besides Bart's. \"Whispering winds, tell me the path that I must take tonight/ to the place where sleep shall carry me into twilight...\" Bart:He\u2019d caught it, caught the semblance of uncertainty that rested within it. She was a poor liar and even her face betrayed everything she tried to stand for. If he were a lesser man he might have tried then and there to make a stand but he was not, he couldn\u2019t be. He would pretend for the life of him he did not see it and respect her wishes because she rather pointedly respected his. Then she sang. Her father was right, it was beautiful, striking even, as she released the sweet lonesome notes that floated in an out of the ones on the harp. Bart could play a lute and carry a tune but nothing in comparison with her tender approach to such a song. He had wiped his hands when she rose and now leaned back in his chair he was silenced. Gods knew he should have looked away but he didn\u2019t, he would look at her if she looked at him and if she looked elsewhere, well he would be forced to do so as well following her gaze to see what so captured it. Fianna:Their eyes met across the room and she still sang as if for him, unable to look away in that moment. Fia knew it was trouble, knew she shouldn't stare, she tried to look away. She did not see the glance her father made between her and Bart, the look of triumph on his face at a possibly successful hook. If she would have, the notes would have soured. She played three more songs and then put the instrument down, soon returning to sitting next to Bart. Her face was flushed. She did not meet his gaze again at the moment.Bart:Bart was at a loss for words, and anyone that knew Bart would have told you that was as impressive a feat to produce as making the man miss a mark and he never missed. When she took her seat it was to him avoiding looking at her too, he did not have words, well he did, but he knew she would not appreciate them. Still a second later he would tell her, \u201cYou sing like the trees of home,\u201d it was a strange thing to say to her and he\u2019d looked forward when he said it but right after he would look at her and add softly, \u201cThe elves left them, abandoned them there, and yet they remember that time and they mourn it together. I had never thought to hear such a voice that might encompass all of the beauty in the way they sing to one another but you do Fianna.\u201d Fianna:She looked at him in surprise, her cheeks flaring red. \"My mother sang the same way. She taught me...\" It wasn't what she meant to say... she meant to thank him. She looked down at her food, unsure of what else she could say to him at that point, but then she finally did give a soft, \"Thank you.\" Bart:\u201cI would have liked to have met her then,\u201d he was sincere in what he said about her for he\u2019d been sincere in what he\u2019d said about the trees. There had been tears threatening the edges of his lashes that he\u2019d made sure were blinked away when she returned, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he would say, \u201cIf you ever travel North into Eldermere that once belonged to the Elvenfolk you should sing there as she taught you, they would be happy to hear such a voice as well.\u201d Fianna:She was not sure how to reply to that. Fia didn't even notice the tears he hid so well. It took her a long moment to deliver her words, \"I... Wouldn't know where that is.\" She had never left home, not even with her father. \"I have yet to see what is beyond these trees.\" Bart:\u201cAbout two weeks on horseback Northwest of here,\u201d he did not chide her for not having seen beyond home, \u201cIt is where my people settled when I was a boy. I had not seen nothing but it until the last few years and I miss it so.

She returned to her trencher to eat her now chilled food, irritated with her father for having to show her off when she didn\u2019t want to be and not letting her eat in peace. Fia chewed on a piece of bread and gazed at Bart, \u201cIt sounds like a good place to be.\u201d The girl sighed and looked at her trencher now, picking at her food as she chewed what was in her mouth, nibbling upon some grouse here and there, cheese, et cetera\u2026 There was a lump in the bottom of her belly preventing her from enjoying her meal, probably because she was fighting her attraction for the man she had been seated next to.Bart: \"If you ever decided to come that way I would personally give you the tour,\" he was not joking in this. Watching as she picked at her food it was regrettable it had grown cold but his had also suffered for the time she'd sang as he had sat rather still to listen. He had not marred it by chewing or picking at it. Still he had an appetite, one that could not be denied, and a meal that was not cooked over a fire in the woods was the best thing he could have hoped for after his earlier injury. He used his own bread to sponge up the loose gravy that was splattered over roasted potatoes, \"But as it is my home I admire it more than most others might.\"Fia: She managed a slight smile, a guarded one but genuine enough. \u201cI thank you, then. I will be sure to send a messenger ahead of time to let you know if I will be coming that way.\u201d More than likely not, she said to herself inwardly\u2026 He was proving to be trouble without him even realizing it. It wouldn\u2019t do that she was attracted to him\u2026 her father might take it as love and force a marriage that was not wanted by her, and probably not by the would-be \u201csuitor\u201d either. Fia took a bite of fruit and gave pause, chewing thoughtfully. \u201cI am sorry about my father,\u201d she said low enough for only him to hear. \u201cHe is trying to play matchmaker and that just won\u2019t do. I\u2019m not interested in love and marriage, and I should think you\u2019d be running for the hills if you weren\u2019t hobbled.\u201d She snorted and ate more fruit.Bart:Bart felt her distancing herself, her apology was only a way to relay the fact that she intended on remaining a servant to the people. Devoted in ways that did not need to involve another who might distract from her freedom. \"You need not apologize,\" he may not have been fond of her father's rather obvious intentions but he did not blame him either, \"He only does what he believes is best for you, it is simply unfortunate you do not see eye to eye.\" He did not insert himself into or out of her wishes, he simply looked across the small space between them and with a grin would add, \"I might not run so quickly as you believe.\"Fia:\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d she asked in some surprise. Her eyes narrowed, not in anger, but as if she was trying to get a read on him. \u201cI\u2019m not exactly a prize.\u201d She was trying a little harder to put him far beyond her walls of defenses. Of course, her father would disagree with that if she ever said that loud enough, but he was biased, wasn\u2019t he? She finished her food and pushed the plate away from her, looking for the world like she was going to bolt at any given minute.Bart:\"No, you're not,\" it might seem insulting but he gave her little time to react to the way he said it, which was with a small amount of disdain, \"No woman is,\" were his next words, \"That phrase is all too often used for that matter. My own mother to me is a priceless and I would never compare her to any amount for she has a strength of character that I admire and I see so clearly within you, which is why I said I would not run. You Fianna have courage beyond measure that is not tainted by hate, as do most healers.'Fia:She wasn\u2019t offended by his reply, although it would have been nice to be called beautiful. Ah, well. Fianna nibbled upon her lower lip and then she said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you are talking about with the courage, but I suppose I can take a compliment. Thank you.\u201d With that, she stood and said, \u201cIf you will excuse me, I\u2026 am going to put my instruments away.\u201d Courage my arse, she thought miserably. If I had courage, I would stay and keep looking you in the eye. Her father gave a sour look and sputtered in an effort to get the command out to have her sit back down, but she was already gone with her lap harp and heading up the stairs.Bart:\"Of course,\" he'd missed an opportunity to compliment her and yet earlier she'd not stroked his ego. He'd passed on it for the slight bit of irritation at a choice of words. When she slipped away he knew it had probably been a poor choice and yet he let it stand. The rest of dinner passed without incident. When it was done he would head back out to the stables. He was doing a poor job thus far of remaining off of his foot but he needed to check upon Gem again. He carried a lantern across the stamped grass that led out to it.Fia:She was already in the stables by that point, having taken herself out through the kitchen when everyone else was distracted by the rest of dinner. The girl was talking to her mare in hushed tones, not paying attention to the comings and goings of others in that moment in time. \u201cWhy does he have to make my stomach knot up so?\u201d she asked softly, her forehead pressed to the beast\u2019s neck. \u201cI have to get out of here before I lose myself. I cannot just leave my people\u2026 they need me\u2026 I need them. I just don\u2019t have room in my life for someone like him\u2026 except\u2026\u201d She sighed and said, \u201cOh, never mind. Listen to me, carrying on like some fool over a man I barely even know.\u201d Because I wish to know him. A lot.Bart:Bart was unfamiliar with the stable but the night was coming to a close and while the gates were locked and a few strays brought in the fanfare was dying out. He entered hearing just the tail end, but enough to be curious, he still had the good sense to give her a cough clearing his throat to alert her to his presence. He should have done it when he first entered and Gem pawing about and turning in her stable would have done it a second later if he had not, \"I did not mean to interrupt Miss.\"Fia:She gave a little bit of a startled yelp and she hissed out, \u201cYou should not be walking. I insist you rest your foot or it won\u2019t heal right.\u201d Fia wasn\u2019t sure if she was more displeased that he caught her talking about him, if he heard what she said, or that he was up walking. She understood he had to tend to the horse, but if he would have asked, she would have seen about having a crutch fashioned for him. She didn\u2019t want him to hurt himself even more. With a sigh, she looked over at him, squinting at the lantern light\u2026 \u201cI do not mean to be cross with you, I just\u2026 don\u2019t want you to hurt yourself more.\u201dBart:\"Maybe I did it because you're cute when you're angry,\" he took his shot while he had a chance to do so his good humor having failed him for a while earlier but returning rather ardently now. He set the lantern on the hook beside Gem's stable. He'd seen to the horse earlier but the mare worried if he did not see her before he turned in. It was a custom when they were on the road for if something happened to him she would return home without him. He undid the latch on the gate pulling it aside, \"It'll heal, just not as quickly,\" he gave her this reply with his way of grinning.Fia:\u201cI am not angry,\u201d she said with a sniff. \u201cAnnoyed, perhaps,\u201d she continued and then pat her mare on the neck. It seemed like she wasn\u2019t going to get to finish her one sided conversation with the horse even though she wanted to, and that did annoy her\u2026 But it seemed she could not avoid contact with the man until he was gone. His grin made her insides melt a little and she became annoyed with herself by that point. Damn it all, she thought and was prepared to make another run for it, he'd even be able to tell.Bart:\u201cI\u2019m good at producing that result, or so I\u2019ve been told,\u201d now he was moving onto self depreciating humor. Gem walked out of the stall itself turning herself about without a harness. The horse seemed to be doing an inspection of Bart as if making certain he was still in once piece. Then she seemed particularly interested in his pocket. He caved after a moment producing a few smaller carrots he\u2019d swiped off the table, \u201cYou have a nose better than a hounds Gem,\u201d he complimented the horse rubbing her long nose.Fia:She stared for a long moment and watched as his horse rooted out the carrots he seemed to have taken. Biting her lip, Fia let her gaze move back to her mare and replied, \"Well, stop annoying people then?\" The young miss looked like she was ready to take flight again, but she did not this time. She remained where she was and produced an apple for her own mare. While the beast munched away in good company with the carrot eater, Fia was trying not to look at Bart again.Bart:\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he said gravely his hand crossing his heart, \u201cIt is a part of who I am.\u201d He chuckled with good humor even if the rest had been serious. He could not contain himself long it seemed from his true intention of the joke. Feeding the carrots one by one Gem worked her way through them without difficulty.Fia:\"What did I ever do to you but take care of your injury?\" She asked with dry humor. Finally, she turned to look at him with her hands upon her hips, a look of mock irritation on her face. \"I never.\" She gave her horse one last pat and then started to put away the brushes that were laying off to the side.Bart:\u201cYou helped a stranger in need,\u201d he said lightly. Gem still stood between them but he could see her just past the rump of the horse, \u201cAnd I repaid you by making sure it takes longer to heal,\u201d he was serious at that and he sighed, \u201cI would apologize for it but I can\u2019t truly be sorry. I needed to make sure Gem was alright.\u201dFia:She dropped the brushes in the bag they belonged to, and then froze a little at the tone of his voice as he said what he said. She turned to look at him again and said, \"I suppose we're even. My father is practically throwing me at you for a hopeful marriage and you are not running yet.\" Fia snorted.Bart:\u201cHe wants to know that you\u2019ll have someone there for you,\u201d he voiced his opinion even if it wasn\u2019t necessary. Gem had stopped searching for carrots and he opened the door the horse obligingly going back in, \u201cJust as you\u2019re there for everyone else.\u201dFia:\"I think he sees me more as a thorn in his side,\" she said with a gentle shrug, watching Gem move into the stall for a moment before returning her gaze to Bart. \"And besides, why a stranger?\" A handsome, gruff stranger that I've been preoccupied with all damned day, she added silently. \"He doesn't know you... nor do I.\"Bart:\u201cYou\u2019re right, he should be more careful, and you do barely know me,\u201d he gave her what she wanted in those few words. Excuses. He hobbled the few steps over to her and held out his hand politely, \u201cIt\u2019s Bartholomew Eads,\u201d his full name this time, \u201cI am an only son to a wonderful mother who never doted upon me but I knew loved me. My home is buried in woods once occupied by elves. I am not an elected leader nor did I choose the position but I am their voice,\u201d he chuckled again, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because I don\u2019t know how to be quiet,\u201d then he returned to his introduction, \u201cBut I care for them, deeply, and I know what it\u2019s like to want freedom and yet feel trapped. With all that being said it is nice to meet you Fia.\u201dFia:She did not take the hand right away, but when she did, it was as if a jolt of electric shock went through her. Attraction was an irritating thing when faced with a man who couldn't help but to annoy. She let his hand go as if burned and murmured, \"So you take care of people too.\" It wasn't a question. Despite the irritation, she was intrigued about his home and people. \"No, you don't know how to be quiet.\" Yes, she longed for freedom... She wanted to taste it. \"Lovely to meet you, Bart.\"Bart:He felt it as well, but he did not draw back like she did, he allowed it to fall to his side where he stretched his fingers before curling them. It was dark in the stable and the action was one she might not have noticed. His face, however, the dark eyes and the way he was slightly above her looking down, that she would. It was emphatic in nature, something dark stirring behind the eyes that held such kindness. There was scarring upon him one might never see on his body but he wasn\u2019t going to tell her that, \u201cIt\u2019s a talent,\u201d he told her with a grin, \u201cTruly.\u201dFia:\"Aye,\" she muttered, lost in the way he looked at her... at least for a time. She wanted him to... to what? The unknown answer confounded her. Her instinct was to lean closer, and she started to until she realized she was doing it. Then her cheeks filled with heat enough that she wondered if he could see that through the darkness of the stables. She forced herself to back away a little, turning her attention to closing the gate into her mare's stall.Bart:She was lucky he could not see it or else he would have commented upon her flushed cheek. A joke made in poor form surely but one he would be willing to make if only to hear her laugh. She did laugh after all and the sound was quite joyous, \u201cI am sorry Lady Fia,\u201d he would tell her stepping back as well, \u201cIf I have offended you it was not my intention.\u201dFia:\"Why would you think you offended me?\" she asked as she latched the stall gate, turned back toward him. A shaft of light from the moom caught the red in her cheeks. \"Why are you sorry?\" She stepped closer again, and she said, \"Agh, by the goddess, you confuse me so.\"Bart:\u201cYou confuse me as well, Lady Fia,\u201d he told her in answer to her questions, \u201cYou draw back away from me as if to make me think I have offended you and yet you still converse with me. I believe you\u2019re being polite as is due to your station but I don\u2019t demand it. You\u2019ve shown me enough kindness to pass a lifetime with and be happy to have known it.\u201d He caught her cheeks, red in the darkness, and his dark eyes flashed in the same gleam as he half stepped into it. He was not smiling now, but completely serious.Fia\"I draw back because I don't know what to think, not because I am offended.\" She sighed, \"I don't understand what this is. I am not being polite, and you should leave my station out of it. In fact, I would like very much if you would shut up now and enlighten me as to what is happening. You look at me and I want to sink into the ground.\" Her eyes were moving left and right, searching.Bart\u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019m as charming as I am annoying,\u201d there was his sense of humor again, he grinned bringing it back up. She searched for answers and he really did not have any, or he did and he wasn\u2019t willing to admit to them, he could not remain here and she could not leave her people. Therefore he was covering up attraction with something else. He\u2019d step back but he did so on the wrong foot. \u201cAh,\u201d he said as he slipped back onto his rump the act rather clumsy.Fia:She sighed again at his answer and then shook her head as he fell to his butt on the stable floor. \"Serves you right for eluding a real answer.\" She said with no sympathy, then held her hand out for him to take so she could at least attempt to help him back off the floor.Bart:\u201cProbably,\u201d he said reaching for her hand. There was hay next to him, a great bale that was undone and soft, therefore he would give her quite the tug to pull her into it. If he did not succeed she would be able to pull back out of his grasp, for it was not too tight.Fia:She gave a squeek and found herself in the pile of hay. She grabbed up a pile and tossed some at him, then another handful. \"You wretch,\" she said with laughter in her voice, \"I try to help you up and this is how you treat me?\" Flop went the next handful, unless he stopped her.Bart:She did not fully laugh but he did as she tossed hay his direction. He slid down further into the pile and began to toss it back her way. He did not address her insult but instead grabbed her by the wrist that threw hay his way, once he had it he slid his hand upward turning about and half pinning her, \u201cI\u2019m horrible,\u201d he agreed with a grin not realizing what position he quite put them in yet.Fia:She panted between giggles as they flung hay either whic way, and all of a sudden, she was beneath him partly. She looked up at him and her expression sobered. Her eyes widened a little as she peered into his, and that was when she decided not to hide her attraction anymore. She lifted and pressed her lips to his in such a maidenly manner, the way a mother would kiss a child.Bart:It was precarious to start, and when she came upward, well, he came downward. She kissed him tenderly, sweetly, but he kissed her as if she were a woman. He desired her and the first voyeur into the unknown being hers gave him his own courage to reach out in return. Capturing her lips there was a part of hesitation to it that disappeared and yet he drew back. She had drawn back before, every look since the moment she met him hesitant. He looked down to her, \u201cFia?\u201dFia:Oh Goddess, she thought when the kiss turned into something more than she knew how to give. Suddenly, she was feeling... heated... like electricity flowed through her veins. He was the one that pulled back and looked down at her. \"Yes?\" she asked when he queried, not even sure where to begin with what just happened.Bart:He knew better than to push, this was dangerous. Therefore he bent backwards, onto his knees, and then onto his feet, he held out his hand to her to bring her up. He found in that moment only a short bit of his humor, \u201cYou have hay in your hair,\u201d he told her but he did not chuckle this time his smile only half heartedly formed in his amusement.Fia:She didn't quite understand what was happening between them. One minute they were hot and the next, cold. She let him pull her up and she stared at him. Fia lifted a hand and picked said hay from her hair. \"So do you,\" she said with a weak attempt at humor, and then she was turning away with hands moving up to her cheeks, and again moved to touch tingling and kiss swollen lips.Bart:His hair rested just at his shoulders when free, and as it was held back in a throng it had imbedded itself and it was coming loose. He laughed then and began to pick it out of her hair, \u201cYou cannot go back in the house looking like this, especially when I look just as much of a mess.\u201dFia:\"I will climb into the loft. They would not be surprised to find me there, for I often do sleep there.\" She said, and had to bite her tongue to keep from inviting him to said loft. But then she turned again and he was there, and... she just leaned in and kissed again, this time the way he had kissed her.Bart:She was chaos in all its forms, wild, free, inviting, and if she was going to kiss him with such reckless abandon who was he to refuse. His hand captured her waist drawing her up against him, his free one embedded itself in her hair brushing it back to the nape of her neck as the straw had. Before it could become so heated that he did not wish to leave her side he would put his forehead against hers finishing the kiss breathlessly, \u201cGoodnight Lady Fia,\u201d he told her before releasing her to head inside the home. They could not both stay for rumors would start.Fia:\"Goodnight,\" she said breathlessly, knowing they had to part before tongues began to wag. She watched him start to head off and sagged against the nearest stall, heart pounding in her chest. She was shaking as she headed toward the ladder, put one foot on the first rung and held another rung well above it. Fia looked back toward him and muttered a soft oath and began climbing up into said loft to try and find hay to sleep in.Bart:He glanced back once, in the doorframe, wondering what I\u2019ll fate had driven him to find such beauty in places he could not stay. Making his way across the yard he tossed a few pieces of straw into taller grass where no one would pay it any mind. Within the room he was assigned he elevated his foot thinking of the tongue lashing he would receive if he did not. He leaned back in the chair and put his face in his hands before uttering, \u201cBart you fool.\u201d", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Fia:"}, "post-95147": {"user": "Fianna", "user_num": 3622, "timestamp": "1580774970000", "message": "The next day found her back at the road, having finished her rounds early.
