An open field that runs for miles, veiled in a deep, billowing curtain of fog that never seems to relent, regardless of the weather. This is all anyone can see of Gloaming Meadows from the outside anymore, an insignificant, mundane, downright boring little farming community tucked away in the middle of nowhere. An unnatural silence permeates the place, as if the trees are unshaken by the gentle winds that roll over the field, the birds silenced, no song nor caw heard, even the trickle of rain when clouds roll in overhead seems muted here. The plain is dotted only by withered trees, piles of hay, rotting crops, and that stark, scarlet line. The line, the line on the grass that runs all the way along the field's edge, a deep crimson, black in some places, one could mistake it easily for paint, if it didn't stink of that ferric stench, like rusting iron: the smell of blood. The closer you get, the more sinister it seems. The breath in your lungs fighting to find it's way up your throat, a tingling in your finger tips, the hairs on your body bristled as goosebumps cascade across your skin. Something is wrong with that unsettling, though seemingly innocuous trail of blood. As you pace the unnatural barrier, it quickly becomes apparent that overwhelming sense of dread is far from ill founded. The line is littered with refuse. Abandoned carts, carriages, and plow equipment, some of it clearly quite expensive and exquisite in craft. Clothes, tattered, torn, as if something snatched the wearer right out from underneath them. Weapons, left shattered, and splintered, useless, sinking into the mud. Then there are the bodies. Corpses, animal, human...dozens of them. Cows which like once roamed these green pastures, stomachs sloughed open, guts spilling out to stain the earth that malevolent red. Deer, wandering off from the sparse forest lands just beyond the border, bisected, dismembered, in all stages of decay. A leaf-litter of feathers, like the birds were plucked right out of the sky. Some of the corpses seem fresh, barely days old, others are nothing more than bone and tendon, one can rarely even find a creature or poor soul still gasping their final breaths, strewn about the field, crying out for help, but if they've passed that line....it's too late. Sometimes you can see it, them. The things that paint this crimson line and adorn it with the corpses of anything that wanders too close. Shapes in the fog, standing upright, like people, but with too many limbs, or legs that bend one too many times, or looming figures that stand far too tall for any man, or creatures on all fours...or six...eight...more limbs, animals with shapes that don't match anything, mundane or mythical, you've seen before. Then there are the bumps in the earth, these unnatural bulges, bubbles beneath the dirt that zoom across the field, tossing up dirt and stones as they go, burrowing mounds that patrol the line, waiting for something or someone to wander just a little too far. Sometimes they try to lure you in, the sounds of cries for help or sobbing, or friendly voices....familiar voices, people from the outside, people you know couldn't possibly be in that fog, screaming out for help, screaming your name. Is there a way past? If you're insane enough to have some reason to try and get beyond the line, then there's only one person who could help you: The Vivisectionist. Wandering the line, staring into the fog, scrawling notes in a leatherbound book, sampling the soil and the plants, sometimes collecting the corpses just beyond the line to be brought back to their lab set up in a little shack just a short walk from the border line. Dressed head to toe in unusual black robes and a frightening bird like mask, this questionable character is the only person to ever escape Gloaming Meadow. It seems almost unnatural the coincidental timing of the doctor's appearance at the border and adventurers approaching it's edge, as if they always seem to know when someone is trying to enter the isolated villages. Their identity is a mystery, much like the land they patrol, if you're looking to find a way past the line, they serve as your only hope. Though happy to help, expect if you ask them for their aid, they are more than likely to ask of you a 'small favor' once you're within the isolated township. Before you agree to anything, make sure you understand the terms clearly, or you might just end up agreeing to something far more grueling than you guessed, and the eccentric doctor is very particular about upholding deals, you wouldn't want to make an enemy of your only hope of ever returning to the safe side of the line.
