Perhaps not even native to this world, the landmarks are alien and unnerving. Rock and clay form buildings of uneven skew, and incongruously wrought entrances \u2013 ribbed with monolith bones and taut membrane. Fungi grow in thick, intense clusters down the jagged silhouettes \u2013 towering tall with phallic\u00a0 heads and thick stalks punctured with gills. The rapid blossom of peculiar life is startling compared to the dehydrating landscape encompassing Anguis. Bulbous tentacles spring froth from eaves, twisting with sentinel life \u2013 smaller appendages lining their fringes with glowing red hooks. Upon closer inspection, it would seem the tentacles had mouths, laced with crooked, albeit razor teeth. Porous domes loomed like brains atop the structures, pulsating with sticky nectar, lobes of grayish hue writhing. Figures marched in the expanse, shelled with large bone shields and crimson capes near the backdrop of the mountain. Ancient tales had been told of the Anguis, as though it was a fallen society \u2013 a lost city. Hidden within the folds of dunes and the acres of sand \u2013 inflamed with terrorizing stories of atrocities, and multifarious magic, it was notorious. The Chalice of Serpents, The Cosmic Cradle, Nest of Worms, Charnel Crescent; names whispered either in dread, or yearning. There were those who dared not fantasize about the archaic city, and those who agonized to be sated.

Spreading across the terrain like a liquid plague, quicksand made of trapped souls and organic decay. Spreading, stretching, spreading, stretching; grotesque growth increasing for miles, corpses of a thousand dead multiplied the mire.  Evolving with microbes, new genus of peregrine diseases flourished in the biotic bog.  In the primal fields stood a pulsating structure, shaped by lobes of dripping matter, slicked with the saliva of strange glistened beneath the full moon. Sectioned nodes fluctuated with movement as they writhed to the beat of Golgotha. Chunks of putrefaction contracted, and hit the ground with sickening splats, as the landscape developed. The clouds passing traveled with speed, manifesting fleeting shadows that obscured the bridge, allowing fear to overcome the senses without the clarity of the moon\u2019s light. The smell of death permeated the air, dominating the senses with reflex to vomit, steam rolling from the sludge as it roiled, exposing centuries of waste and desecration. The structure was domed, with the curvature and angles of a skull, mangled mouth frozen in a scream, splintered wood saturated and festering served as a strait to the iniquitous sepulcher.  Gersholm parted the algae of the frozen mouth with his scepter, revealing the inside of the structure. Gnarled vines oozed with malady, and the shifting of the structure groaned and rattled like a soundtrack of death. The inside of the sepulcher burnt the nose with pungent aroma, the sickening sweet smell of rotten meat, so strong it overwhelmed the senses and stuck on the tongue. Gersholm\u2019s eyes watered profusely as he pulled up the collar of his cloak around his nose and mouth, providing a flimsy but significant barrier against the thick scents. His boots sloshed through the muck, sinking up to the eyelets and laces. Chunks of unknown squish rocked his balance, yet he dared not reach out for the only thing around him was curtains of skin, ribbed with bone and laced with hair. The organic curtains created a foyer around him, a small area of entrance.  He heard the familiar sounds of sludge-steps approaching him, the ill noise of suction as the unknown creature loomed closer. An arthritic hand grasped the bloody curtains, and pulled them back enough for the frail frame of Ungtha to step through. The woman stood no taller than four feet five inches, swathed in black linens and Anteyx fur. Upon her head was a crown of antlers and bone, entwined together. \u201cIt\u2019s been centuries, Gersholm.\u201dShe addressed him by name, her voice sticky and raspy, as if her throat was full with the muck below their feet. \u201cYou haven\u2019t aged a year.\u201d She neared closer, the smell of patchouli and sandalwood provided reprieve from the decay around him. Her gnarled hand took his, bringing up to clouded eyes, \u201cEven your hands remain smooth.\u201dIn one fatal plunge of his scepter, he unleashed the arcane, pulsating through her small figure with undulating light, stealing her life before she even understood the gesture. The frailty of her body did not even make a sound as it collapsed, being consumed into the manure almost instantaneously, the sepulcher hungry for new flesh, leaving naught but gurgles and bubbles were she once was. As slowly and deliberately as he entered the organic structure, he was gone. Vanished into the thick fungi growth that resembled a forest.

The night air was so still, not even the blades of dead savannah grass whispered, and the sky so clear that every star was bright enough to leave pinholes of light imposed over your retinas. There was a large plume of smoke in the distance, where the men in bone-shields marched. There was no sight of an actual fire, but the amount of smoke was alarming, and burnt the eyes even from miles away. The smell was of burning meat \u2013 not necessarily unpleasant, but peculiar. The opium stack was extinguished with her forked tongue; seven and a half feet of svelte figure filled the doorway as she ducked into the bony threshold of the membranous structure. Once inside, the warm glow of the candles coupled with the glow of crystals gave weak ambient light. The corridor was empty, with veins of crimson splaying out on the walls like arteries, the faint twitch of expansion every few seconds. One could follow the circuit of substance if they watched close enough, disappearing from sight down the long corridor but always returning to the entrance and repeating.There were small pedestals lining the hall, with deep bowls balanced atop, filled with various fungi, herbs, and blackened liquids. One by one, she removed the ornamental organs from her horns, and placed them in the bowls, as she marched down the passage.The door at the end looked much like clenched fist, multiple sections curled in toward the center; within a few moments they would slowly unfurl with a peeling sound, and she\u2019d step through the sinuous door.
