Darkhive features seemingly endless rooms and corridors, dozens of towers, crooked walls and spires and a thousand secrets and hidden passages. The entire structure is nigh impregnable by force - situated in high mountains far to the north where life is cold and almost impossible. The only access is via a single, dangerous path carved through stone that overlooks the raging ocean to the west and the uncountable forests of rocky spikes to the east.\u00a0The lands around Darkhive are perpetually covered in night; the sun shines for but an hour a day and to their north, a curtain of thick, shroud-like darkness stretches from one horizon to the next, ever threatening to engulf the citadel completely.

The boat was riding in rough waters, getting knocked around by the icy residue and raging waters.\"Shut up, boy,\" Ingsten barked back, \"I am in command of this ship, I am in command of this crew.  Keep your tongue in your mouth, lest you wish to be thrown overboard,\" the old man commanded, being the eldest of the crew.Seven longships, each outfitted with about a dozen or so Varan warriors each, had been sailing along the northern coastlines, heading west after leaving their homeland of Asgeir.  Eventually, after sailing so far west, they happened upon a giant castle, which unbeknownst to them was the Tower of Darkhive, where the Revenants stayed.  At first, this was their intended destination, but the crew captain, Ingsten, wanted to venture farther north, into the shroud of darkness that lay beyond them.  Vald and some of the other men disliked the idea.The water had picked up dramatically within minutes, tossing the ships around as they continued in the direction.  It became noticeably darker and chillier, threatening to freeze the Varan where they sat or stood.  Vald and the other men were forced to hang on tight and clutch the sides of the longships so as to not get launched off of them.\"Ingsten,\" Vald cried out, \"we shouldn't be here, our ships won't-\"\"By all the gods, boy,\" Ingsten barked off, turning around and stomping to the middle of the ship where Vald stood.  \"I've had enoough of your-\" Ingsten reached up and clamped his mighty hands around Vald's throat.  Vald was prepared to fight back, but the longship hit a sudden bump, which tossed the front of the ship into the air.  Both Ingsten and Vald was sent flying out of the ship, along with the other ten warriors.Vald struggled to find something to grab onto, but finally found a piece of plank - a broken part of the longship - and used it to float back to the surface.  He gulped for air the moment he arose, frantically looking in the cold darkness to see what was happening.Six of the longboats had been completely mauled by the raging northern waters.  The last one was on the verge of being destroyed, but it had been at the back of the party and its crew had managed to stay on.  He knew coming here was a bad idea.  A few other Varan were struggling in the water, gripping onto pieces of broken wood like Vald.  \"Come on-\" Vald swallowed a gulp of sea water, choking as he spat it out, \"get to the ship!\"The Varan frantically hand-paddled their way to the last surviving ship, whose sail was slowly tipping over.  It crashed into the water and its crew experienced a similar fate: flying out of it as if they were in a catapult.  Rope from the sail hung over the side and Vald made his way to it.The rope was frigid and hard to grip, but the strength and will of the Varan is strong, and so Vald made his way into the broken ship.  Before long, several other surviving warriors had climbed onto the ship as well.\"Row!  Row!\"  Vald cried out commands as picked up what little bit of oars remained and threw them to his compatriots.  They caught them, stabbed them into the waters, and began to row the ship back southward, towards the castle.  \"To the castle,\" Vald told them.Soon enough the waters became less-wild and was more forgiving for the intruding Varan.  Vald looked around: only eight other men had survived the disaster.  In the distance, ruins of the longships protruded from the water, and bodies of drowned Varan littered its surface.Finally, the group made it to a rocky shore some distance away from the Tower of Darkhive.  Its inhabitants no doubt saw - and laughed at - their attempt to head into the northern waters, into the darkness.  \"Settle here,\" Vald told the crew, \"pull the ship onto the shore and get some rest.\"Should the Revenants of Darkhive come to them, they would receive them.  Otherwise, they'd rest for the moment and make their own way to the castle.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"Turn the boat around,\" Vald repeated to Ingsten for the hundredth time.  \"Turn the boat around, now,\" he reiterated after being ignored.

Against one arm, a beauty lay with her chin resting and fast asleep.

The man, Leviath, had only a single part of his lower body protruding from this blanket; his right foot, which lay above the floor atop the parietal plating of a blood-stained skull. \"I hear the whispers of dark anew, my eminence,\" she said at one point, rather out of nowhere. \"Yes.

It gets so tiring here, my lord. So dull, so carefree.\"\"Not for long, I feel. I require back that which I bestowed within you.\"\"Right now?\"\"Yes.

She cringed, grit her teeth and rolled her eyes into the back of her head, but even her endurance could not stop the cries that would part from her lips. \"Ah. There it is,\" he said once more, before removing his hand from her meat. Blood began to pool, but her wound would soon close as easily as his had; leaving her gasping and recovering from the ordeal and curling up closer to the blanket for her own comfort. Leviath, meanwhile, revealed a deformed and disfigured creature sharing the qualities of snake, raven and bat. It scratched, growled and screeched, but Leviath soon opened his fingers and allowed it to spread its wings. \"It has grown much within you, my wife. This essence of your nature, this child.\"\"What will become of it?\" The beauty asked, still struggling to speak. \"The form is incomplete. I must say, I was curious as to what would happen if it were to be removed so early, but I never expected anything quite like this. Still, now that this being is free, we will send it south. To act as your eyes and ears, just as you are mine.\"The creature screeched once more, before being thrown into the room.

That somehow those doors were leading into areas that the strange attendant wanted her to see, rather than what might actually be there; if anything at all.\u00a0He climbed three sets of stairs, with each climb leading off into another corridor before twisting back around to continue upwards. When finally they reached the top, a pair of blackened wooden doors were pushed open to reveal an extremely large and empty hall, where moonlight basked the ground from the many catherine and rayonnant windows and the cool night wind blew inwards the transparent silk that covered them. The room appeared entirely empty and almost unused, for a layer of dust covered the floor disturbed only by the footprints that led towards the room's centrepiece: a large, raised throne at the end.\u00a0Stone pillars held up the high ceiling, where a shrouding darkness hid the original design...

Instead, walk forwards into the room and pay homage to your new master.\"A sudden, strange wind that \u00a0blew violently up the stairs would push her inside and slam the doors behind her.

None of it appeared to disturb her - in fact, the sight of men and women dining and making love seemed to spark the first sign of life within her, causing the faintest tinge of pink to permeate her cheeks and filling her eyes with a spark of excitement. She remained silent as she followed the mustachioed man up the stairs and into the room that was, apparently, their final destination.<br><br/>The writhing darkness above received a brief, fascinated glance, and then her gaze fell to the throne. Her heart began pounding violently in her chest, and there was the slightest hint of awe about her face as Celaena moved forward, preparing to take the final step into that room, only to find herself pushed that last distance by a strong wind. Stumbling into the room, she stiffened, then reminded herself she had chosen this.. she had chosen to pursue her destiny rather than ignore it and remain in the world of the living, unfulfilled and empty inside. Her hand rose to the clasp of her cloak, unfastening the pin there and letting it slide from her shoulders to land in a heap on the floor.

In some strange display of affection he gave it his finger, at first petting it lightly upon the head and then allowing it to sink small, sharp fangs into his flesh. \"But if you wish to know what I find interesting then I shall tell you. The land known as Helmfirth is one; an island of criminality in the south and monsters in the north.

Though do not worry, dearest 'Grandma', for know that I will not permit a faction of these creatures who do not grovel at my own feet to grow further in power or influence. I am the first of this cursed bloodline; no other Revenant came before me and none shall ever surpass me. And by that authority, if they should ever attempt to invade your mortal lands, I will cast down upon them a vengeance so wrathful that their bones will create deserts of ash.\"He smiled then, as though he found the thought amusing!\"There are more things that I do admit are of interest. The eastern men are one, for should their scheming amongst each other ever bear fruit in the form of a single, united nation then that mastery of scheming will no doubt be turned westward. The southern deserts are another, for in those ancient cities and oceans of sand there no doubt exists forgotten and mystical power. And should you look to the borders of this desert, to the place of death known as the Outlands, you will discover races of beasts whose warlike nature and lives of endless battle and bloodlust could easily sweep through lesser nations if ever they were united; they are the Orcs and Goblins, the tribes of the Greentide.\"Leviath began to expand his chest, as though simulating what it was once like to breathe. No air passed through his mouth or nose and as soon as his chest reached a certain size, it collapsed again. \"Yet none of these interest me more than Isra.

I had been hoping it might contain knowledge that could interest me, but instead, I found a place of carnal desires. Although I have nothing against those who indulge in the pleasures of the flesh, I found the lack of variety in Helmfirth a bit disappointing. I\u2019m glad to hear you are willing to judge them to a higher standard than their current one.\u201dIt seemed the Revenant had visited Helmfirth personally, or at the very least met with someone from there of importance.

Perhaps there had been a dispute on which of them was the stronger one, as that seemed to be something Leviath had a very strong opinion on himself.\u201cThe deserts to the south do contain very intriguing knowledge\u2026 I was able to see some of it myself first hand.

He had mentioned the Empress, her dearest Naoki. Eyes from all over were on her now and as time passed surely only more would scrutinize her. \u201cAh yes, Isra, the city which I currently call my home. From the sounds of it, you seem to view it in a rather negative light. Perhaps some of the people who first helped build Isra also view it similarly to you. The majority, however? The majority, for the moment, are happy or at the very least pacified. How long until people rise up? I\u2019d say that depends on how long the current Empress lives and what kind of successor she leaves behind. The people of Isra say they want freedom, but what I believe many of them want is simply stability. If they can continue to live in safety and go about with their daily task, they will remain happy. The illusion of democracy also still remains to ease the consciences of the less discerning citizens, which as I\u2019m sure you can guess, is also the majority.\u201dThe old woman coughed rather dryly, her response to the Revenant\u2019s question regarding Isra finished.

What illusion had hidden them for so long might well seem impossible to grasp, but so effective it was that once Grandma dared to blink or look away, this army of ghouls seemed to fade back into the realm of invisibility and silence; non-existent like shadows in the dark.

Thus, perhaps it is more sensible to say that I became a traveller when that home was lost?\" A moment later he turned, walking towards the main keep of the castle until there was at least a few metres between them. \"You sound like a person who might enjoy a good story, Grandma. So allow me to tell you this one, for it is so rare in these endless nights for me to have the opportunity, and there is a question I like to ask afterwards that always gains interesting answers,\" he said, looking into a window of the keep that, as expected, lacked his reflection.

Perhaps you will have heard of him, though if not then you will soon become familiar with him,\" he explained, before closing his eyes to begin the tale proper.\"Many moons ago, when the old kingdoms had just passed the height of their power and that world had not yet been torn asunder, a great king named Aethelwulf became aware of my presence in this place. Aethelwulf was considered a wise and mighty hero by his people, who conquered his enemies with his mind just as easily as he did with his sword, and always treated those he bested as though they were his own beloved countrymen.\"By the time he was nearing forty years of age he became suddenly aware of his own impending mortality, as well as how far he had come in his life and how far he felt he had left to go before he could be satisfied. Aethelwulf wished to become Aethelwulf the Great, you see; to conquer all lands and end all fighting between them. With this dream and this knowledge constantly on his mind, Aethelwulf woke one day and told his family and his people that he would don a simple cloak and go on a pilgrimage to pay homage to those old gods. His loved ones, thinking nothing more of this than how much they loved him for his piety, bade him farewell and let him go on his way.\"Aethelwulf crossed valleys, rivers and mountains. He passed great poverty, crawled through miles of untamed thickets and walked along roads in the most dreadful state of disrepair. After many weeks, the road of his pilgrimage bade him turn to the west and follow it to a great and secluded temple, but instead of taking this road as others had expected of him, he continued northwards and into the harsh cold and the dark where only most fierce and savage dare to live.\"That place became known as The Wylds. The story of Aethelwulf's journey through the wylds, with nary more than a stick to protect himself, is a tale in of itself that I will not repeat here. What is important to note is that when he finally walked along the same path that you took to reach this citadel, Aethelwulf was wounded, rugged, stronger and possessed of greater wit for his efforts. Once he reached the gates, I had them opened so that he might pass undisturbed to my great hall and come before me on my throne. And once he reached me, this great king went down to his knee and knelt on the floor in the moonlight. I asked who he was and how he had come to this place, at which point he regaled me the tale of his life and the journey he had taken in great detail, a tale that I in turn have just briefly described to you.\"With a grin, I then asked him to explain the purpose of his journey and what he wished to gain from it. 'Master Leviath', he said, 'I am fearful of my own death and of the collapse of my kingdom once it catches me. I have heard of the great power of the blood that is held here, and wish to ask you to share it with me so that I can complete my duties and safeguard what I have made'.\"I asked him how I could be sure that he wouldn't simply abuse this gift, that he wouldn't use it to become a great evil, a being of power and endless thirst. He could offer no answer, so I then asked him what he would do with the time that I could give him. 'I would improve my kingdom,' he told me. 'I have walked through untamed wilderness, so I will clear it for farmland. I have walked on crumbling roads, so I will repair them and make new ones. I have passed people in great poverty, so I shall provide them with riches. I have crossed rivers without bridges, so I shall build them. I have climbed over impassable mountains, so through them I shall build tunnels. I have seen kingdoms without peace, so I shall annex them and create it.'\"I found all of this amusing, and had almost made an decision in my mind of whether or not to grant his request. Yet even so, there was one more thing I wanted to know and so I asked him the most interesting question that I have perhaps ever asked. 'What can you offer me in return,' I said, 'that I could want but have never had?'\u00a0\"'There are many things,' Aethelwulf replied. 'I can give you endless riches and power!'\"'But do I not already have these things?' I asked him. 'Then I can find you the most beautiful woman in my kingdom, and deliver her to you to take for a bride,' he answered. 'Is beauty not in the eye of the beholder?' I questioned, 'And are my current wives not beautiful enough?'\"'Then I shall make you beloved by my people, with a name that shall never be forgotten for all of history!' He exclaimed. 'And what need have I for such immortality, when I am already immortal?' Came my answer. 'Then I shall gather the architects of my kingdom and build you a great castle that no enemy will ever be able to conquer', he boasted. 'What use is that when no enemy can march here?' I quipped.\u00a0\"'How about knowledge; everything in the great libraries that are tended by the scholars of my kingdom?' I smiled at this, but never-the-less replied, 'but Aethelwulf, what if I already know everything that your scholars can offer?'\"By this point, the king was becoming desperate to succeed. 'What about the blood of my people?' He asked. 'An endless supply of food for you and your loyal revenants.' I gave a laugh, then pointed out that we keep our own slaves for such consumption and treat them like kings in return for their willing use as cattle.\"'Then what about my kingdom?!' He cried. 'I shall make you the legitimate heir, so that should I die my country will pass to you!'\"Leviath stopped speaking for a moment in order to slowly walk back over to his bench and sit himself down. After looking back up at them, he moved on to the final part of his story. \"I told him such a thing alone would not interest me, and that I was growing impatient with his grasping for whatever could hold him. 'I will give you one more chance to make an offer,' I said, 'after which I will give you my final decision',\" explained the revenant. \"And so we come to the questions I have for you.\"\"What final offer do you think King Aethelwulf made me?
