Built out of stone sourced from Mount Tearwood, in which the town lies in the shadow of, as well as the Ironwood that surrounds it, the buildings of Mason\u2019s Bay have stood for generations. Until recently many of these buildings have stood vacant and decrepit as the people of the Bay have slowly left. Now there is a rush to construct additional buildings as the burgeoning population begins to outpace the space available. Taverns, warehouses, hotels and trade halls are once more packed with people and goods which has made the original population overjoyed and welcoming to all that come.

All five of them were built an ox. Only half of them wearing any shirt at all, letting the cool river breeze cool their aching muscles. It was hard work cutting and moving the stone in place. Even harder to move the enormous iron wood logs. All of them looked tired to the bone, eyes with dark bags and bruises marking their bare skin. Yet they looked content, a look of satisfaction on their faces could be seen. One of the group, a dark skinned giant of a man turned his body around to face the stranger. His chest was a battleground of scar tissue, plainly visible against his dark flesh. \u201cDepends on what you can do friend.\u201d He said, his voice deep and reverberating, a strange accent could be heard. The worker looked down and up, inspecting the foreigner, his eyes rested on his cane for a moment. \u201cWe\u2019re always in need for skilled craftsmen or scribes.\u201d He said after a moment. He raised his hands to the man; each one could easily wrap themselves around Xyrix\u2019s head. \u201cThese aren\u2019t made to be delicate!\u201d Behind him the other men laughed uproariously, stomping the ground or slapping their knees.

She\u2019ll know what to do with you.\u201d He leaned in close to the stranger, talking quietly. \u201cWord for the wise friend. Be careful what you say around her.

They never broke her you know, something she paid dearly for.\u201d He shook his head sadly. \u201cThe marks on her skin aren\u2019t the only scars they gave her.\u201d One of the other men raised his giant tankard. \u201cFor Cyrene! He yelled, trying to lift the now ruined mood. \u201cTo the Red Death!\u201d  \u201cTo the Red Death.\u201d The group of workers replied, lifting their tankards and drowning them. \u201cAnyway, my good friend. Spoke Calar, wiping froth from his mouth. \u201cYou should find the Isran Garrison about hundred meters down that way.\u201d He pointed down one of the main roads. \u201cCan\u2019t miss it, full of fancy Isran Guards.\u201d \u201cThank god they don\u2019t leave the town.

I plan to extend my hand to whatever is needed done.\" He wore a smile once more. Progress always felt nice.\u00a0The Isran garrison building was striking different from the surrounding infrastructure. Although originally a tavern, several additions had been made by their new occupants. The first and most obvious being the liberal application of the Isran colours and flags which drape over the building in all directions. The second being makeshift fortification additions. Several windows had been boarded up or reinforced while a small barricade had been erected around the premises made from a combination of crates, planks and other such materials. As Xyrix asked his question to one of the guards, who looked down at him as the strange spoke. His plated armour and great shield reflecting the new day sun back onto Xyrix. He could hear a deafening shriek coming from inside. \u201cTen men?! We asked for support and all you send is ten men?!\u201d The guard winces at the sound. \u201cThat would be her.\u201d He replied to Xyrix. \u201cShe\u2019s currently pre-disposed\u201d\u201cI will not calm down! We ask for a hundred and you send us ten! How are we supposed to defend the fort with this!\u201d The shriek continued, along with several sounds of wood being smashed. The guard winced again. \u201cShe\u2019ll be out in a minute I assume.\u201d Almost on que the front entrance flung open with a crash and a figure emerged. A woman of middling height wearing leather straps and iron plate could be seen lowering her foot after kicking the door open. Blazing long red hair covered her face as she left, which she quickly began to retie into a bun behind her head. \u201cMy lady.\u201d Spoke the guard quickly. Standing to attention as she reached the edge of the property. \u201cThis man is here to see you.\u201dAt this close range Xyrix could see that the woman\u2019s features better. Green eyes shone with great intensity as she inspected the newcomer and a light smattering of freckles dotted her face. She would have been stunningly beautiful if it wasn\u2019t for the scars. Deep and jagged they criss-crossed her face in multiple directions. Like a painter ripping his masterpiece to shreds from frustration. Deep blue tattoos of strange spiralling patterns could be seen on her exposed flesh, of which there was much. Her armour seemingly made to only protect the most vital of areas. The faint lines of further scaring able to be seen beneath the blue ink.\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d She said bluntly as she stormed off from the property.", "link_list": ["/post/91684/thread", "/user/3461"], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/7ApRiwK.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@xyrix\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/91684/thread\" timestamp=\"1561458069\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-3461\" title=\"Xyrix\"><img alt=\"Xyrix Avatar\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/7ApRiwK.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/91684/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1561458069000\" title=\"Jun 25, 2019 2:21:09 GMT -8\">Jun 25, 2019 2:21:09 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-3461 group-0\" href=\"/user/3461\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@xyrix\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Xyrix</span></a></span> said:</div>These men were friendly and kind enough to answer his questions and Xyrix was more than thankful.
