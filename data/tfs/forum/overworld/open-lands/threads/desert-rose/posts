A priceless artifact that have been sot after by many. Those who have tried to take the rose have ended up dead within the temple or dead from the exertion required to reach this sacred temple. If one comes into possession of the desert rose it is said that it may grant the owner great power and can be sold for thousands upon thousands of gold. The price obtained from selling this desert rose is so much that they and their children will never have to work a day in their life. It is not easy to find the temple, but those that have heard of its location have only said to follow the path void of life. No one knows who built the temple or why it was built. For those that reach the temple, it is an impressive sight. A large stone structure lay nestled against a study sand dune. The faint glow of a torch can be seen from inside. The torch never seems to go out. Some say the temple was recently built while others say the temple has stood for many centuries. All that is known of the temple is that it is filled with unknown power.Dart was lucky to find her way here on camel back. She has dressed herself accordingly as to not die by the desert heat. Going out into the unknown desert is one thing but going out unprepared is a death sentence. She hated doing her thieving in the daylight but with this temple she would rather it be light out. Who knows whats lurking in the darkness. There is something beautiful yet unpleasant about this place. Dart has learned that other jeweled roses have been found in different temples but the desert rose is the hardest to obtain. She knew by that statement alone that she had to try.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5e/0f/7e/5e0f7e92c64b1161aca3472f8397bd5f.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5e/0f/7e/5e0f7e92c64b1161aca3472f8397bd5f.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}, "post-95139": {"user": "Tassarion Genroris", "user_num": 3680, "timestamp": "1580743701000", "message": "His journey had been one of self-reflection.
