Frankly she appeared more a pauper than nobility and given her way she would keep it in that manner for she rough housed more often than necessary. Feet firmly planted Vith had just spoken about their belongings when hers landed within the tree. Her companions barely concealed laughter was frowned upon her expression one of inconvenience. Climbing a tree was not difficult, she often did it along the way to gain her bearings and the first time she had been traveling to the dwarves she would sleep at night in the tall branches in order to avoid weary travelers on the road. By herself she was formidable but frightening weary peasants was not her intention. The second that the orb with Vith\u2019s belongings fell from the sky landing quite heavily upon him she lost it. Her poker face was much less developed than his and she dissolved into outright laughter where she had to hold her gut as he cursed Kacien for being so reckless, or purposefully mean. Either way it was one of the few times he\u2019d been pranked in such a manner and it broke his normally bright self. Placing one hand upon the tree to keep herself upright there were tears in her eyes. At least he waited to explain the pathway until she finished wheezing. Wiping her eyes he had just finished when another orb appeared. This time the deer came through. He looked every bit as elegant as before his large antlers shifting and swinging slightly. He had appeared humongous in the halls but in the open it was very clear he was as large as a horse and if Myra had wished she could have rode him easily. \u201cIt appears we\u2019ll have company,\u201d she told Vith. Not perverse to the stag being present he had been on her side before and perhaps here he might also favor her. Someone other than Vith to speak to openly might be a blessing as well. \u201cLet me collect my belongings,\u201d like a spider monkey she put one foot on the trunk of the tree, reached for a branch, and she was off. Swift and quite steady the next branch just seemingly appearing where she needed it. The trees surrounding the elven forest may not respond to her own magic and her words but they did not betray her just yet. Dropping down her pack, and then her bedroll, she found her mace laying quite gently upon one of the larger branches. She hooked the sling around her right wrist and holding the line of the handle she made her way back down, half hopping and falling before landing superhero style on the ground bending her knees to prevent damage.

Still her smile and laughter was a nice change and always seemed to lighten up the room - and in this case the field. \"Oh indeed it does...\" Vithkun said surprised seeing the stag emerge from another portal and he nodded towards it friendly. \"I'm not sure it would be in any of our interests if you followed us into High Haven, but I'm sure this is a place where you would be able to enjoy yourself and find relative tranquility. Of course you may accompany us some of the way.\" Vithkun explained the stag although he didn't know if his words had been truly understood and he turned to Myra who had expertly climbed up in the tree. \"I must say I've seen mountain lions climb less skillfully than you.\" he said and nodded impressed. It was probably not a surprise that she could, but that she did it degree of natural movement was something to behold. \"Well if that was all, then we should continue. We'll have a couple of days journey until we reach the outskirts of our true borders. Anyone no travelling with me or who strays too far will no be able to pass anywhere near our borders.\" he said with a crooked smile. \"The enchantment is made by the nature elves' branch who registers sentient life forms that journeys through the Southern Forest by The Ancient Path and either rejects them by leading them astray by illusions, lets them through if they are pure elves or in rare cases confronts them if they are found important or interesting enough.\" he explained as they set foot on The Ancient Path walking through the old gate with the mossy elven letters engraved into it. The forest was old and crooked but seemed neutral at first before venturing further into. Vithkun walked as if vigilant but after a while he released the tension a bit as they continued to meet no discernible obstacles. \"This is slightly odd, the trees recognizes me of course, but they seem more curious and bewildered by your presence than I would have thought. Luckily they don't seem hostile as I might have expected and it's almost as if... you're stirring some long lost memory within them..?\" Vithkun pondered but was mostly just happy that the trees would not start giving them trouble.

Whispers carried between them, endless wonder in their wake their sleepy voices slow and long but not something she could not recongize. The ones of her home were just as ageless and she spoke to them as well by touch but now that she spoke the language of the Elves she could interpret far easier but it was kind of him to speak it aloud as she shifted away from one of the older saplings gazing up to its branches. \u201cPerhaps it is from the passage of the last Drow, it would have been some time ago.\u201d \u201cVith do you think you could manipulate metal?\u201d Using his name openly now until they met others she would address him in kind for her pretense of pretending to care about his title had wholly disappeared. Familiarity here might harm or save her but for now it was enough that she could openly address him. If he stated that he was able she would explain her plan of using the Morningstar itself, of hollowing the center and placing the jewel inside of it. Hidden and yet noticeable but any might think that the weapon was simply enchanted. It would keep it out of plain sight and in it at all times and if someone were to attempt to disarm her Vith could openly dissuade them or take the mace himself.

You may not be able to interpret their whispers, but they'll understand your answer.\" Vithkun teased.

The insecurities that Myra felt right were not shared by Vithkun but still he noticed them. The jolt of movement when he woke her up and the general tenseness she emitted was not the way she usually carried herself - but of course it was to be expected. All that was left to do was to cross his fingers hoping it would be a pleasant experience for the most part although of course some of it would surely not, they both knew of the barriers that needed scaling. But first and foremost it was his home and he knew it would still welcome him home. Vithkun then turned to the white stag and bowed. \"You've been a formidable guide and companion and you showing us the right way to the jewel is immensely appreciated. However we must take our leave now and I'm sure this forest will suit your every need and I believe we shall meet again some day.\" Vithkun said with a respectful smile although he had never really established any close contact with the stag that seemed more inclined towards Myra. The stag then lowered its head as if accepting Vithkun's words and slowly strolled over to Myra putting its head on her shoulders as if wishing her a good journey - perhaps deep inside knowing what dangers lay ahead. If Myra had parting words for it would blink slowly before turning around heading in the opposite direction again. \"Yes, let us get on our way then.\" he said and gently put a hand on her back knowing that she had already forged a bond to the stag. \"We will meet it again - there is little doubt about that.\" he said comforting leading her along the way they had to walk. As they progressed it seemed like subtle signs were telling them, that they were indeed going the right way. The green leaves and moss on the trunks looked vibrant like never before, the blue sky was deep and you could almost get entranced looking into it and animals were abundant and not the slightest bit scared of the two elves. Squirrels racing around collecting nuts and some even curious enough to climb the trousers of the drow - one offering Myra its findings in stretched out arms as it sat on her shoulder. Later that afternoon it was as if a subtle music chimed through the forest, a longing but beautiful music as if they were calling a lost kin home - which indeed they were. \"You hear that, Myra? It's the 'Echellon' which is the music that is sent into the forest to guide my kin in the right direction, although it is not for me personally. It will scare and confuse any who didn't have a good heart. But it's there always and the forest itself acts as the resonance chamber.\" he explained and boldly trotted ahead.

Welcome back.\" he said and turned to Myra with a significantly colder gaze and the air of superiority was noticeable even through his posture. \"A drow...\" he said and observed her as his eyes slowly inspected her equipment, size, muscles and so forth - but never meeting her eyes. \"I have no idea how it is, that you are accompanying our dear prince, but that is as far as you go.\" he said assertively and nodded towards the arrow that had been ever so accurately shot into the ground only inches in front of her feet. \"Garullais!\" Vithkun raised his voice firmly. \"Don't treat my honored guest with words like that. Although I appreciate your vigilance and carrying out your duty as guard captain of the Southern Woods, you should have considered that she was a guest before saying such things.\" Vithkun reprimanded him as the elf raised his brows confused. \"Guest?!? But My Lord Almear, she is of the drow race - our bitter enemies..!\" he argued. \"No matter what she told you, she is most likely a spy!\" he said looking at Vithkun turning his head with wide open eyes. \"She is definitely not - she is not even able to lie. You will consider her an honored friend of High Haven and she will walk with me.\" he insisted with an assertive voice as the guard captain slowly bowed keeping his eyes fixed on Vithkun as if he was waiting for the prince to change his mind back. \"Very well...\" he said and turned around. \"Lower your bows, she is... elf friend.\" he hesitated as the other elves complied but looked equally astounded as the guard captain. Several others stepped out of the bushes to reveal themselves as Garullais waved his hand. \"Stay on guard while we escort the lord and...\" he stopped and glanced briefly at the drow. \"What was your name again, drow-kin?\" he asked before finishing his instructions to his soldiers and nodded to Vithkun before leading the way forwards. \"I'm so sorry Myra..!\" Vithkun whispered embarrassed. \"I... had not anticipated this level of suspicion when you were traveling along with me - we'll change that I promise.\" he said and nodded assertively. At the same time the guard captain fell back a bit walking with his hands behind his back and turned towards Vithkun. \"Did you come back with what you had set out to get?\" he asked muted though Vithkun was in no hurry to answer. \"I have and I haven't.\" he announced trying to cloak the truth because the jewel would not be the dowry it was expected to be, but the jewel was found and brought back none the less. The guardsman gave a quick and restless glance towards the drow and his eyes told everything she needed to know about how he considered the drow to have something to do with this uncertainty and odd change he felt from the prince. But out of fear to insult his highness by asking the drow more questions he nodded and simply took his place a few paces in front of them again. \"We need not speak too much about the jewel if it's not necessary, I believe.\" Vithkun spoke and gave her a more light hearted smile. \"In a couple of hours or so we'll cross into our capital, Xaomere, where we'll spend the night before heading for the palace tomorrow.\" he revealed although not what kind of accommodation she could expect.

In reality he was angry that Garullais couldn't just understand what he understood about Myra, but as Myra had taught him respect was not found in ascertaining dominance but in encouraging words. As Vithkun walked besides Myra he knew that even the softest words were not going to take away her feelings of rage right now, but nevertheless he felt the need to explain.\"Garullais is a loyal elf but he doesn't trust outsiders and has a history to back it up. He was among the ones that spent years in drow prisons during the war and only made it out because we exchanged prisoners. I'm sure there are drows like him too as our prisons aren't exactly luxurious abodes either.\" Vithkun admitted as they strode forwards at a leisurely pace. After a few hours they crossed through the forest and into open lands where immediately the expanse of High Haven really opened up with the capital of Xaomere standing as a vast city a couple of miles ahead. The road leading there stretched itself through the open country with rolling hills, groves and colorful fields on its path. \"Thank you for your vigilance Garullais, we will make it to the city ourselves from here.\" Vithkun said and nodded. \"Yourselves..?!?\" he asked surprised and reluctantly nodded. It was absolutely not common that royalty would move without the aid of both servants and guards but was of course not restricted to following those exact guidelines. \"Thank you.\" Vithkun smiled and stretched out his hand looking at the soldiers. \"If you would be as kind as to lend us your cloaks, we need not the eyes upon us right now.\" he elaborated as the soldiers reluctantly handed them their cloaks and Vithkun then gazed at Myra and nodded towards the city. \"Should we get going?\" he suggested while leaving the guard captain and his soldiers in his wake and casually throwing one of them to her. \"Let's use these if we meet anyone on the road and keep them on inside the city while in the public.\" he said with a gentle smile. As they strolled towards Xaomere Vithkun eyed an orange tree with low hanging fruits ripe for the picking and with a swift jump he leveraged himself with the use of a fence post and grabbed a couple of oranges. \"Here have one of these!\" Vithkun said and started to peel his own. \"I have looked forward to tasting the fruits and berries of High Haven for so long that I can barely contain myself anymore!\" he admitted as he ate the orange in big chunks enjoying the fruity and yet surprisingly sweet elven oranges that held so much nutrition that even a stubborn ork would feel himself cheered up after eating one. \"And if you think this is good, just wait until you taste the wine... oh no wait...\" Vithkun said and chuckled remembering her preferences. \"I think we'll find you something fitting!\" he joked as the impressive wall and gate of Xaomere grew ever closer and revealed the pure scale of the city with its towers and spires reaching even above.

His name was not on her lips now but she wished something else to be. Eyelashes flickering they looked to him with such uncertainty before glancing downward. The ring was beautiful. A representation of the places they had been and a mixture of the dark and the light wrapped around one another and rather elegantly done. It fit perfectly as if it were meant to have been placed there. \"It's gorgeous,\" and it was and she had lost all control of her emotions.

The longer they went on the longer she had to plan.Assessing the situation for any sort of advantage there was not much in the area. A water barrel that she might be able to climb in order to reach the straw roof was by the building itself. A dangerous proposition because while they might fall through the thatch themselves she might as well. Dismissing it rather quickly she could not handle all three on her own without assistance. Crying out for Vith might reach him but it would mean revealing his own identity and he had been lax to do so thus far. Cons were outweighing the pros until she saw a rake. It was not useful in battle and they'd be able to cast it down quickly but the alley next to the very bar itself gave her an idea. It was barely but a few feet apart meaning that if they attempted to attack it would be shoulder to shoulder and difficult. Frankly it took away some of the advantage of the distance of her own weapon but by placing it one on one would be to her own advantage. Besides the alley had no good lighting and the elves, while able to see in dim light, would not be able to keep their sight the farther she backed in-between the buildings. Deciding on this path a split second decision made she reached out with her left hand towards the rake. She needed but a another second in order to swing it widely. They might laugh at such a ridiculous decision but all she needed was for them to be cast back a few feet away from her giving her time to swing, drop, and turn on her heel racing the ten feet to the entrance of the alley itself. Braving a knife to the back they carried not daggers and throws with a dagger had to be precise and paced off to expect a true hit. Undoing the clasp of her cloak as she turned she tossed it upward into the air as she began her run meaning that the fabric lingered in the air hiding her escape if only momentarily. Hopefully enough they did not get their wits about them to throw, and if they had it might be succumbed by the cloak itself, and enough to get her into the alley which she would rush into turning immediately and backing into the depths of the darkness walking backwards having glanced first to make sure there were no entrances into the alley itself.

The hooves of several horses and the rattling of armor and spears thundered closer the bar and the alleyway and the she would hear the horses coming to a stop right outside the alley followed by a brief commotion as if her opponents and the horsemen had a disagreement of sorts. Shortly after she would hear the armored men getting off their horses and one peeking into the alleyway. It was a soldier wearing a bronze colored armored with exquisitely ornamented silver details and a long bronze colored spear with a twisted point. \"Ahh she's in here my lord!\" he confirmed as another elf stepped in front of the alleyway wearing the same kind of armor but having removed his helmet and carried her cloak in his left hand while his right rested casually on the hilt of his sword. White strands of hair were visible and though slightly lower in stature but more bulky in build with green eyes instead of the blue Vithkun had, he looked not too different. The elf inclined his head and seemed to hesitate to speak but was also curious. \"I think you must have dropped this.\" he then spoke and threw the cloak to Myra. \"You must be the one who travels with Vithkun aren't you?\" he asked with a faint smile waving her out of the alleyway taking a couple of steps back. \"At least the errand boy told us so, and if so you are our guest - not our enemy.\" he said glancing in another direction where the three elves Myra had just fought had been tied up with hands behind their backs laying on their stomachs on the ground. \"Unnecessary drawing of blood is... unseemly.\" he said as if scolding the three elves their had caught as Myra would see eight other soldiers present. \"These do not represent our general disposition around foreigners and they must have fallen far into desperation.\" he excused on his countrymen's behalves. \"I am Duke Gandrys and I'm...\" the elf started to explain and stretched out his arm to greet Myra if she had cared to come out from the alleyway but was interrupted in that very moment. \"Cousin..!\" Vithkun exclaimed surprised but happy to see his old ally Gandrys present. \"What is this commotion out here? Weren't you just going to get some fresh air, Myra?\" Vithkun asked surprised as he gave Gandrys a hug before scratching his hair unable to glean what to think of it. \"Yes... Cousin.\" Gandry's said with a wry smile speaking in a noticeably more measured fashion than Vithkun. \"You've changed...\" he added as he reluctantly hugged Vithkun back as if surprised but not displeased of what he saw. Not answering the question about having changed he gesticulated at Myra with his palm.\"This is Myralthrine of Host, she has been my faithful companion through countless perils and on long adventures.\" Vithkun said proud to introduce her to Gandrys who was akin to a childhood friend to him - which was not always the case of family in High Haven. \"Pleased to meet you.\" Gandrys said to Myra in the same civilized yet measured fashion he spoke in normally and gave her a short bow taking her hand gently giving it a brief kiss. \"I am honored to meet someone who has endured my cousin through an extended amount of time...\" he added as it was as much as a praise for Myra as it was a friendly tease of Vithkun.

Fortunately for them, they were interrupted by another sort of intervention that involved much less steel in the end. Waiting patiently in place if the new arrival was hostile, or decided to gang up against her, she would still be better off in a position that was half fortified and while not easily exited she could climb upward and run along the edges of the roofs. If nothing else she would alienate all of the elven race and impose a different sort of magic but it had never occurred to her, even as she stood there now, to use anything other than sheer determination and a hard well aimed swing. Knees bent, eyes weary, she held the morningstar in position to swing low and across her stance fully revealed without the cloak, as was her frighteningly bright hair and eyes. The initial newcomer, his armor bright and his tone just as much so, had her furrowing her brows. When Gandrys entered the ally itself she did not shift at first from the way she was settled into place. He spoke well, in the same manner as Vith, and the resemblance was not wholly missed in her quick assessment as he tossed the cloak her direction. Sidestepping she straightened and caught it in her left hand keeping her mace at her side and him at a distance. He had rolled it to where the cloak itself did not fan out which lessened some of her suspicions but not all because she never hung her weapon back nor even bothered to take her eyes off the location of his weapon if only to glance at his face while he spoke and behind him. Her promise to watch her speech to Vith meant that she held back a wry comment about what was unseemly with a short terse, \"Yes,\" in reply to who she was traveling with. The truth would be revealed no matter who stated it unless he denied her. His word would outweigh her own but the ring resting on her finger was a heavy reminder of his commitment for the moment. He waved her forward and with the addition of his own troops she saw no easy way out of this situation, she came forward just past the beginning of the street lights but not in clear view of the street itself. The loop on the end of the cold steel of the handle was around her wrist and she allowed it to slip down until she gripped but the very edge allowing her range and reassuring herself the weapon would not fall from her grip. Muscles never untensed until a very clear voice exclaimed and she finally came fully into the light watching him embrace his cousin openly. Gandry seemed more reserved and she smiled at the exchange quickly covering the reaction as she slid her weapon back into place finding it no longer necessary to hold onto it with such gumption. \"There were a few others that thought the fresh air suited them as well,\" she told Vith nonchalantly shrugging her shoulders slightly before he praised her and Gandry finished greeting her taking a gloved hand which she almost shook in the human fashion before he bent downward. Unused to being treated as a lady she understood the expectation but not the willingness to do so but concealed her confusion well.

Well, saved 'the situation', because Myra had likely won against such scum, but not necessarily a clean victory - and how would a drow drawing elven blood look when contorted by the most sly of tongues? Luckily that didn't come to pass. \"Really..?

It could also be the relief to see someone accepting her as she was within these lands as neither Garullais nor those three elves had made the best first impression. \"Ahh yes, he's a galant man when everything comes down to it.\" Vithkun answered politely although he was surprised that she referred to him so specifically. He was holding her hand and she was holding his yet he sat with the feeling that it was neither tight nor firm enough and might slip at any moment. Their kiss had been only hours ago and yet he no longer felt her embrace or touch of lips. As if she had turned from him and her words weren't currently reaching out for him - but someone else. He might have disappointed her at that moment - but was his words not clear? Perhaps she did not wish for the same thing as the elf. From inside the wagon the visibility wasn't great into the dark night and the two elves could only just see that they were passing through a walled gate and into a courtyard - but not stopping there and instead proceeding into a secondary courtyard where a smaller wing adjacent to the large mansion was situated and the cart came to a halt. \"I think we're here...\" Vithkun said softly although his thoughts were still somewhere else as this feeling couldn't stop haunting him. Stepping out they would notice how large the main house was with several stories but the guest house wasn't small either with two stories and plenty of room along with balconies for each. Both the large house and the guest house had flower cases and vines decorating their front and roses in particular seemed abundant everywhere they looked.\"The guest house you'll be staying in has its own walled garden and courtyard here and access to a common garden from the backdoor. You're welcome to roam both, but I'll ask you to stay with the outer wall to avoid any misunderstandings...\" Gandrys said and nodded towards Myra with a knowing smile. \"The two rooms on the first floor are already prepared for guests so you may use those. There are bathing facilities within the guest house and the servants and maids are there if you need them but will not roam your wing in the night and guards are only posted outside and will be discretely present if you should need their advice.\" Gandrys said bowing for both of them and holding his bow a little longer for Myra. \"Thank you. Gandry.\" Vithkung said politely but also without the banter in his voice as when they had met. \"Breakfast is in the main house in the morning and I'll be taking my leave now.\" Gandrys said with a faint smile and turned to leave the both of them glancing briefly back at Myra. \"Well... It's been some day.\" Vithkun said and crossed his arms looking straight forward. \"We've both deserved some rest I think.\" Vithkun said and proceeded towards the rooms stopping only shortly giving Myra a longing gaze he hoped was not noticed before a short sigh stopped his line of thoughts and he entered. As always Gandrys was taking care of his guests and nothing was lacking. There was plenty of fresh fruit placed in a few bowls along with spring water in a bronze pitcher and wine the silver pitcher. Vithkun sat down in the chair next to the small table and looked around the room a few candle lights to give a faint orange hue to the room. He reached for the silver pitcher and poured some in his cup. What was he to do? He loved Myra from the depth of the earth's core to the highest star - but there was no way he could just blurt it out. For such a thing would come back stabbing him in the back when his parents, brother and fiancee found out.

Just as soft as before, just as kind, as she found her way to her own quarters. Bathing first and foremost she slipped into the warm water allowing it to encompass her and ducking under she held her breath til the last possible moment. Rising upward and splashing the floor she felt a sting at the eyes but ignored it. Spending some time the excitement of the day itself had not left her and she found herself dressed and wandering out to the garden. She was without her cloak, without the ornamentation of her bracers, wearing only a loose linen shirt, the jewel around her neck, and a long grey skirt that she rarely wore due to the fact it was unsuitable to fight in. Her Morningstar was left beside the door, leaned against it, for she felt it in bad taste to carry it in the home of her host. She caught the moonlight as she walked, hair brushed and left own to dry falling in gentle waves. Finding a bench she took the opportunity to expand her mind. Settled with her hands in her lap she closed her eyes and began to search. Quiet moments were so rare after she\u2019d discovered this ability and seeing as it should go unnoticed unless one was truly prepared she felt it safe to expand and test her limits.

Vithkun felt his pain slowly relieved and with a deep sigh he bend his head down into his hands. \"I'm a pathetic excuse am I not?\" Vithkun said as his he looked up and eyed Gandrys whom he had sensed coming into the room. Vithkun was not normally great at sensing other people, but with Gandrys they went back so long that it was almost second nature. \"For what?\" Gandrys asked unimpressed. \"I came because I sensed a lot of strife in you.\" he said and his words comforting but also clearly not impressed with the standard of words Vithkun used about himself. \"With not being able to travel the right path no matter what I do - and since I'm only one elf I must pick one but I cannot.\" Vithkun replied to Gandrys.\"Oh come on...\" Gandrys said and rolled his eyes, slowly pacing into the room. \"I know why you left - but I'm unsure why you came back.\" \"That I am too...\" Vithkun admitted. \"Because why would I? I have the jewel... or rather she has it because I gave it to her, but arriving back here I can't keep the promise I made for my fiancee and thus I must renounce the claim of the throne and even risk being an outcast...\" he spoke feeling a stinging pain in the stomach again cringing slightly. \"I see... so you've come to love the drow with whom you traveled with - even to a degree that you would give her the jewel which is your key to the throne.\" Gandrys seemed to ponder deeply at the remarkable change Vithkun had been through. \"This is no small thing I see, but if there is any advice I can give you it is that you can't manipulate love. I'm not sure old Vithkun would understand - but you might.\" he said and smirked. \"Good night, cousin.\" he said and just before exiting he turned to Vithkun again. \"You look like one who could need some fresh air.\" he said and winked at Vithkun. Vithkun frowned surprised as he put the letter into his shirt for safe keeping. Perhaps it was time that he finally stepped up and announced what needed to be announced. He knew that she was no manipulator of love, but Vithkun was certainly trying to manage the outcomes in such ways he was steering towards inevitable failure on both accounts. He did need fresh air and drew the thin curtain away from the balcony stepping out taking a deep breath... seeing someone in the common garden. \"Gandrys...\" Vithkun said silently cursing the perception his cousin had been born with that he hadn't when he saw the white flowing hair of Myra moving around soon to be covered by the trees. He felt a pull of something... an urgency of going down there joining Myra. But why would he? What was there to be said that he hadn't already? The letter perhaps..? He felt it through his shirt clenching it as he battled his emotions. As Myra walked around the garden the wind would quietly rustle her white hair and the trees almost waving her in the direction she chose to walk. A certain kind of respect was shown towards the drow from the nature and as she sat down it was as if the leaves and the wind went quiet - wanting to see what happened because as she closed her eyes an elf with white hair as her own would stand before her. \"Myralthrine of Host.\" the voice said as the elf stood only a few paces away from her. \"My scout saw you kissing. Why have you come here?\" he asked his tone of voice accusing and disappointing but not threatening. \"The prince is a very important man to High Haven and one I myself would support as king - yet you seem to be forgetting your place and is doing your utmost to unsettle him with your shenanigans. You hope to rise above your stations and life a long life of comfort at Excelmere?\" Garullais asked and paced back and forth somewhat agitated as he spoke to her. \"Tell me how long you have been knowing each other? A couple of months? Half a year? Even if you met as he departed a year ago one could not dream of forming a bond that important in that short a time.\" he said biting his lower lip in anger. \"You are a drow of Host! I say to you now... Go. Leave High Haven if you care anything for his highness and if you do not...

Why should they not when their very sight was meant to allow them to see even in the darkest of places and be blinded in the brightest.Wandering the garden she like Vith had much to ponder. He worried about what his love might do to him and she worried about what her love might do to him as well. They were not opposites completely as both worried for the outcome of something that should have never occurred. How it had occurred was a mystery to her but her heart felt so surely about the subject that she could not deny it. Speaking the words out loud would show the truth of the matter and she even tried to whisper to the night air, \u201cI do-\u201c The word not would not come from her lips. It frightened her for most speech was based on intention and if she could not intend and mean the words than she could not truly put them out there. \u201cI do love him,\u201d she said sullenly, before Gaurullis had ever appeared to ruin her evening and with no one present to hear it. Brushing back drying locks they slipped through her fingers and she nervously trailed down to the ends where she kept slipping them through back and forth in order to provide some sense of relief with the nervous movement. Frankly it was not helping but it seemed natural enough to any passerby. The guards Gandrys had promised to be present were at times. Passing them they were inconspicuous and hidden well. Not enough her brighter night eyes could not find them a glint of steel here or the paleness of their skin catching her eyes. Nodding to each one she found she spoke no words. Nothing was necessary in order to give them notice that they were not as stealthy as they seemed. Taking the spot on the bench she settled downward legs crossed at the ankles and her hands upon her thighs. Before he even appeared she knew he was there, the instant that she closed her eyes to concentrate she felt his movement. He was swift, silent, as he should be and as he\u2019d been within the forest. Opening her eyes as he stopped she met his own without judgement nor car for his immediate concerns. He called her of Host and while it was her origin it may not be truly her home nor name if others were to be believed. Despite her uncertainty on the matter she knew he had no reason to lie. His concern was not of the outside world anymore as he existed outside of it for so long now that he could not possibly know the strife that existed only that it had taken long for one to solve his riddle and that the brokenness between their races still existed. Declaring her of the royal family had no implications on the matter for he possibly assumed that she had been and was downgrading her own family name in order to keep herself safe. Not from her companion but perhaps from him. But it still had never come up with the confines of the hellish puzzles they were put through. For all this she knew that the matter was never going to be settled until she discovered the truth. If the ashborn were only of one line perhaps Annonai could provide answers she\u2019d not been willing to listen to before. Never the less he was not here to argue her name, nor care for the change of it without proof, and he had other stinging words that cut to the bone carrying with it the weight of her own misjudgment. Who was she to believe she was suitable to have even accompanied him? To carry the jewel now? He treated her as an equal but as when they first met he was a Highness, it had not changed even if she had stopped calling him that, and soon enough in polite society she would have to return to an old habit. No threat but logic in his voice he\u2019d considered his argument before he\u2019d arrived wanting to give the best speech available to him even if emotion took over far before he could finish. That he cared for the Prince was truly visible, that he worried he would not take the throne was valiant, that he\u2019d even came in his defense was perhaps the most honorable thing a friend might do. \u201cI came because he asked me,\u201d she finally answered allowing him to finish before she answered. Waving at the seat beside her she invited him to it even if he would not be agreeable, \u201cWe have not known each other any length of time I might have deemed appropriate either,\u201d she admitted sharing with him more than she normally cared to with others. Gandrys had taken to her like a fish to water but he would take more convincing. That was if she even stayed after his argument and it was likely that leaving would be her next step, \u201cYou make fair points Garullais. He is destined to be placed on the throne and when we found the jewel I granted it to him. I could have fought or argued against his plans for it but I chose not to do so. I allowed him to walk unchallenged for I believe that his path is that which shall make him a true ruler. One that is respected and loved by all for I have seen him truly behind that which he shows the world.\u201d Not allowing for interruptions she would let out softly at the end, as soft as she\u2019d said thank you and as soft as she\u2019d said goodbye, and so softly that it was as if her heart could not handle it now, \u201cBut it seems I only interfere in his own destiny...\u201d", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The garden was the same as the exterior of the house.

It hit the coast with the ability to destroy all that had been established and it did. It destroyed her uncertainty, their inhibitions, and a loneliness neither knew existed within one another.

There was much they still needed to learn and while he had shared the meaning of his scars she felt that the lines ran much deeper than the past. The night before when she had touched them, lingered over them, it had been in adoration of his own suffering but there was more connection than she might ever know in the depths of magic that ran within him, and her, and of the past that connected them so truly it existed within her name as well.

Seek us out when you're ready.\" the dolphins said as the floated up to the boat bridge for the elves to dismount and climb up.

As he came back the servants had already been there and outside the room he would find morning robes, and a wooden rack outside the door with all sorts of clothes in it that they must have just put there for he didn't remember it being there before. Myra would find the same waiting outside her room the clothes being casual for wear but of very high quality the cloth smooth as silk and it's touch feeling like embracing a warm summer's breeze. After having bathed Vithkun found a set of clothes that he liked - not wildly ornamented but a light white shirt and an earthly dark green vest with subtle curved brown markings and grey pants to match. Walking down the hallway in the guest house he was heading for the door that lead into the main house where - at this time - Gandrys would surely be up and waiting.

Bathing rather quickly she washed her hair clean of the lake and one of the servant girls took to braiding it a much more elaborate style than she preferred. It was drawn upward and twisted about until it sat upon her crown a weave of silver thread drawn throughout the updo. None touched her shoulders but it only left them clear of the more elaborate clothing. Silk was not her style but the woman insisted that it would be inappropriate to wear rags and armor. Sheepish when it came to dressing she required help in piecing together the underdress, than the top one which was tied in the back with a corset tie up but not tightened to where she could not breath.

All things she\u2019d never consider wearing but was now convinced to by the expectations of others. Ones she was attempting to humor if only for Vith.

They had looked a mess - both of them. \"Are we back to 'your highness' again?\" he said and putting both hands in the side before sighing. \"Oh well, I bet that I can live with that as long as it doesn't come with the frown..!\" he said jestingly. \"Let us enter and greet my dear cousin. It won't be too formal, don't worry.\" Vithkun would say nodding towards the door and proceeded to enter through it and find themselves in another hallway very similar to the one they left. Another elf - this one notably older than both Vith and Gandrys - would bow and give a polite smile. \"Please follow me.\" the tone was friendly but professionally distanced as they were led along the corridor until they entered a mighty room with a long table. Squares of books shelves adorning most walls, large windows facing the garden and dark wooden logs extending along the walls to meet the pale orange colored roof high above them - the logs swirling in elegant patterns. \"Ahhh, there we have the sleepy guests..! I guess today's lesson to Sindry and Falael must be about patience!\" Gandrys said and smiled at his two children sitting on his side of the table to his left shyly eyeing the two elves - the drow in particular. \"We had just sat down after waiting for you, but don't worry about that and take a seat!\" he said gesticulating at the opposite side of the table. Vithkun looked at the two children with a kind smile. \"You have grown so big since I last saw you!\" he said and sat down in front of Gandrys with space for Myra to his right, closer to the children. Vithkun however only got a bit of chuckle from Sindry, Gandrys' daughter. The two children appeared to be about eight to ten years old in human years both of them.\"Don't mind them, they are a bit shy today. They'll warm up to you.\" Gandry's ascertained them - and Myra in particular. The table was brimming with delicious food as white bread, honey, fruits, nuts, cheese, berries and tea was ready for the taking among lots of other specialeties. Vithkun fixed a napkin to his collar and felt his stomach rumbling from all the great food placed before him. \"Did you find your rooms comfortable? In the heat of everything I forgot to tell you that I was called out this night, so I wouldn't have been here if you needed me. But I bet you just slept the night through right?\" Gandrys smiled sipping a bit of tea looking at Myra. \"You see I'm assigned as the warden for this city, so when things happen I'm the one they call for.\" he explained to his drow guest. Vithkun felt his heart calm down - this was luck if he knew any. \"Yes... yes cousin, I can only speak for myself but I've slept brilliantly - better than in a long time.\" Vithkun omitting the precise details here, quite on purpose. \"So what did they call you out to this time..?\" Vithkun intending to switch the topic quickly as possible and as they spoke Myra might find two curious set of eyes locked on her as Sindry had gained a bit of courage. Placing a berry on the side of her plate she gave it a discrete flick towards Myra intending to hit her plate as Falael made big concerned eyes.\"Y-you're not supposed to do that..!\" he whispered as Sindry hushed him seeing her father and her uncle busy with conversation still. \"You went out swimming with Lusca didn't you..?\" she asked exactly as muted as she knew was required so Gandrys wouldn't catch it when engaged in conversation - but the words still would appear clearly in Myra's head as if they had been placed there directly.

One meant to perhaps keep her on track more than the cousin. He bowed, and she stiffened. Servants were still perhaps above her in rank but she\u2019d never once bowed to Vith and she had no intention of doing so to a stranger. Therefore she would nod her head slightly and follow as asked to do. Entering the dining area it was more like a library in presentation. Decorated with books and windows everything purposefully drawn into and presented with the standard style of ornamentation that most elven homes possessed. While beautiful it made her long for some simplicity in style, not as much as the dwarves, surely, but closer to the high halls and dark grey stone and shale of the olden halls of her home. Gandrys greeted them not unkindly and she had the good sense to appear apologetic even if she was not, and the good sense to not comment about the rooms after it came up shortly but for now she settled upon, \u201cPatience is a good lesson, even one I fall short upon at times, thank you for waiting.\u201dPurposefully making sure the children knew her gratitude was for them as well quickly remembering their names as greeted as she took a spot across from the young boy.

Everyone has a certain capability for harm it is whether they mean any to you that you must discern on your own.\u201dWeighty words, and perhaps odd advice, especially when Gandrys\u2019s pushed instead for making sure they understood the difference between different types of writings. It was important to foster and guide the imagination into leaps of great bounds. For them it might inspire their very life to go in different directions or give them the ability to spin tales to others of moral learning or humerous jaunts. For all the worth of the world it was imagination that drove people to dream and stretch beyond their goals and she would never see it cast aside from the hearts of the young for they knew above all else how to keep it alive.\u201cIt would take much more than a few moments to explain us as I find that learning about your own is quite the undertaking,\u201d attempting to dodge some of the questioning the wide eyed looks of the children brought her back around to giving them what they desired, \u201cBut perhaps I can at least entertain you with some of our tales. Ones I myself heard as a child?\u201dIf she hear an affirmative she would continue beginning to weave a tale in a softer tone than her own usual one taking care to soften some details, \u201cIt has been some time since I heard this told and it was only in passing so if you\u2019ll excuse the poor rendition,\u201d she began with this rather sheepish about doing so to start, \u201cThe Drow Language is called Aleath and it is said that it was named after the greatest star of our own skies,\u201d little did the Drow know that the star they considered to be Aleath was also the Elves greatest star, Izale, \u201cWhen both of our races were born of the stars they were given life through their blessing and from such was born two sisters. One who was as bright as their own gleam, pale and beautiful with golden hair and a voice of the heavens themselves. The other was born of the night surrounding that very star, with skin of charcoal and hair as deep as the ravens wings. They shared for a time their aspirations growing together and learning of the very world they were given to improve. Izale being born of their spark resided in the day where she gave her voice to song that flowed through the forests and gave the very trees their own voice so they might sing with her. Aleath was of the night, she roamed the earth and touched every stone and felt the power in the dark places of the world and could see even in the darkest of pitch. They met every morning and every evening when one retired and one rose each sharing of their adventures, of the sights they saw, until one day Aleath, curious as she was, did not sleep for the day. She rose from the darkness of her abode and came into the light. It was blinding to her and took from her her sight leaving her to weep openly until Izale found her laying upon the ground. Her sister took such pity that she shared with her her own sight allowing Aleath to see within the day if she only did not look into the sun. Aleath had never seen such beauty in the light of the day, and while it overwhelmed her she found such joy. She began to stay with her sister and roamed the world to the ends of it but as she slept throughout the night there were things that rose. Dark things that had been kept at bay by her presence but during her slumber threatened the beauty of the day. When Izale found the destruction of the very trees she had taught to sing it began to bring discord between the sisters. Izale wished to protect all she had found and Aleath did not wish to return to the darkness but could see the pain her sister had endured at the very loss of what she loved. Therefore they formed a pact and Aleath granted to Izale the power to see within only a dim light so she might wonder by the light of the very stars that gave them such life. They would protect the other in their sleep and once upon the solstice they would trade places for a day and a night so that both would know of the others beauty.\u201d\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Gandrys seemed to have a tendency to insinuate easily that reminded her that he was of course elven, he may have been treating her kindly and taken her into his home but he was not unlike his cousin in making sure his speech had two meanings.

Myra almost hesitated but did not crossing the barrier into the home. \u201cIt is not only a human view then but that is not fully the view on it either,\u201d she informed him amused at the way he rambled trying to sort them out, \u201cIt is because it is the center that it is settled that way, you are never farther from one side than the other and you are able to bring all together without inconveniencing one more than the other at the edges of society. It is meant to be a symbol, of course, but we worship no God and therefore the high ground is not wholly important but in a city such as this I would assume it to be here as we have found it.\u201d Passing over the threshold they were greeted with a wide entry way. Beautiful in its emptiness there was one circular table in the center of something that ran the length of the home separating it into two wings. It was wide and graceful with floors of one stone and the walls made of a plaster like material that was textured in soft blues that might not have been expected here. Upon the center table rested an old vase nothing within it when they left. A door opened on the right leading to another hall and while down it another opened to the left. The smaller hall was the same as the first, rather plain in appearance compared to the rest of the city. Perhaps this was not what she thought it was for it to be so empty. Walking towards the open door she would say wearily, \u201cIt seems they are not quite done guiding us just yet.\u201dGrouping whatever it was that led them into a group seemed appropriate until they had a better explanation of it. The secondary door led to what Vithkun had asked for, a library. As they passed through the door a fire began to roar, coming to life instantly in the center of the room. It was laid out with a center point as most things seemed to be within Drow society. The room challenged all preconceived notions of just how far the home itself could stretch into the mountainside itself. Within the center of the room was a rounded flume, metal in appearance a wide base of two meters stretching outward in a sphere made of what appeared to be glass the edges smoothed and rounded and two feet in height. Within it were shards of the very same glass filling it and allowing flame to be dispensed around them reaching upward but a few centimeters rising to well over thirty within the center gradually. Above it about three meters high was a tube, shining metal that appeared like stainless as wide as the glass and heading straight upward. No smoke came off the fire but it might have been a flume for it originally. It only lit the immediate area as they walked inside. They could see on either side of it long bookcases, all in the same metal. They stretched upward towards a ceiling made cave like in appearance with crystal deposits that did not reflect the light well. They rose upward and out toward the rows placed about five feet from one another and going well beyond a hundred down through the hall to Myra\u2019s sight, and about twenty to what Vith could see. They extended outward at least one hundred meters. As they began to pass shelves there would be light that lit in each hall, bright ones hung from the ceiling in dropped pendants filled with a liquid that sensed their presence. It would be as if the day were inside each making every system clear to him once they passed. Vith could not see a system in the way things were shelved until he looked higher along the shelves for it rested not at eye level but at about 3 1/2 meters high, and then once again at about one meter high. Enough for a child to be able to sort it. After the first flume was a second but it did not light until they met the first. While they passed the shelves Vith could look down them and see in between them that there were seating areas full of low backed couches, tables and chairs, but they were on the far side of each. Between the first and second flume was a long table, set at counter height and made of glass it seemingly floated with no legs beneath it. Myra had not seen this type of magic before and nothing would be apparent within it until one touched the table itself.

Doing so would compromise their safety and be too great a risk and they would have to settle for a well stretched kiss. Carrying the strap over his shoulder and Myra's hand in his other hand they left the library and followed what path seemed laid out for them. A small grin appeared on his face as he was reminded of what a bloodhound she was when she caught a trail. Relentless and sure footed she would move forwards determined to find whatever was held at the end of the trail. It had been the same when they had just met - she had known the way and her feet hadn't stopped moving before they were there. It was in many ways a trait that many elves lacked, being all too easily swayed off the road picking a flower or brushing the tail of a squirrel - if really unlucky, the elf would forget himself and move in with the squirrel family. At least to Vithkun it seemed like that, but also it often happened that elves were sidetracked by both pride and prejudice not allowing truth to guide them. This truth was what he saw in Myra's eyes and even more importantly, she was willing... no... rather 'unable' to stop pursuing it. Woe to the elf who pleaded his life to following her, if she deemed the goal to be on one of the stars in the sky - because she would get there. The time for reminiscing their journey was however cut short as Myra suddenly released his hand to bend down. \"Something beneath the ground..?\" Vithkun couldn't help but look around the hall and then onto the ground. \"I heard nothing, how are you so sure?\" he asked, knowing not about her scrying, but curious to if she would also have him beaten in hearing as well as in seeing. Had he been himself a couple of months ago, that would have been slightly embarrassing. \"Hmm...\" Vithkun stomped a couple of times in the floor and made the same hollow sound. \"You seem to be right...\" he said and crouched also. \"How about we have a look then?\" he smirked and put his hand down doing a circular movement with his left palm and drawing some elven letters with the right. 'Sand' it would spell and just as suddenly as the letters had appeared, the hard stone floor would start trickling down into itself, having been turned to fine sand a round whole about four feet wide appeared. \"What can you see down there, does it look safe for us to descend?\" he inquired before putting his hands on his sword's hilt again.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"I think that I see something that goes well beyond our minds' fickle attempts to lie and scheme, when I look into your eyes...\" Vithkun added his smile wry.

Staying above the tunnel for now he waited for Myra to tell him about the outlay down there. \"Just a hollow tunnel? You sure it's not just their sewers?\" Vithkun trying to sniff the air coming from the hole, but dank and thick as the air was, it was not the reeking smell of a sewer. \"I'm coming down...\" he said swinging his legs over the hole and bringing up a single elongated piece of carved out wood from his pocket. Moving his finger across it the elven word of 'starlight' appeared, and he let it drop and as it hit the ground the walls and floor would be lit up in a silvery dim starlight so he could see where he landed. Letting himself drop Vithkun landed on the ground knees bent and hands helping him with absorbing the energy before brushing off his hands and pick up up the recently enchanted piece of carved wood. \"Starlight is amazing, it's not like sunlight that shines so sharply that it blinds and alerts everyone of our approach, rather it channels the clear, silvery light out but it's core being dim and hue being discrete.\" he explained as Myra would see a surprisingly large part of the tunnel lit up by the magic, much more effectively than a normal torch. Taking a glance at Myra he sighed. \"You want to go into the mountain, right? I know you, you want to go into the mountain. Well sure, let's go...\" he said reluctantly. It wasn't because he wasn't going to follow her to the end or was disinterested in finding out the truth, but her energy for seeing these things through to the end was daunting to say the least.

Most Drows were equally as well endowed with a loquacious personality as well if one gave them time to convey it truly. Communication was the key to insult, to frighten, to brazenly pave the way for action, Myra found none of this a comfort. For she felt action required no words to follow through but there were some words that could be added to such that were meaningful, words of love, kindness, words that inspired courage and bravery. These were ones she wished to fill those around her with and yet she was not against a well placed insult because injury did not always have to be physical. Descending into the depths the stairs took them almost directly downward, no turns for some time until they came to another landing. They were hundreds of meters within the ground. No one dared dig so deep other than dwarves which made her further question the craftsmanship. A relationship with them had once been established and hiring outside of their race was not unusual. An orc had once arranged a trading agreement much to her surprise. Then it leveled out, the width still over three meters. The ground here was wet, the outside walls weeping from water kept well underground. It was not covered, but damp, and their footsteps left imprints along the water. The cave ceilings were rougher, and this was where she felt it and gave Vith reason to pause her hand before his chest. A thing swooped low before them. Before others screeched and fled away from the light. \u201cBats,\u201d Myra knew these creatures and admitted, \u201cThis must have been what I felt through the floor, but why he was so high I do not know. Lower your light lest we disturb them.\u201d Moving forward still the water seemed purposeful now, as if to wash the floor clean and indeed there were crevices along the sides were it went into an underground river which washed it away. At the end of the long hall they came into a chamber. One that was not made from human hands but from the flow of water through the rock itself. There were stalagmites and tites that hung and rose from the ground. Picking a path that had once been placed in the center they could walk easily. It was gigantic, too large to describe the true depth of the caverns themselves. After a few more steps they found themselves in a hollowed area. There was a walkway with a depression on either side of them. It was man-made, this, the ceiling still untouched, but this area was hollowed purposefully as if it were made for a concert. The walkway leading out and the surrounding area lowered so one could look up and clearly see those who spoke or moved along it. There were stairs along it, occasionally, to allow one to walk down into the pit. Vith might raise his light and look down to the ground to see it appeared solid, but grey, as had the stone around them. Walking down the pathway to the center it was well over a hundred yards to it, and in the center where Myra expected it to be as cut out as the rest it had not been. They walked onto a mound, one that had a gradual descent into the ground around them. That was when she was able to see it. Around the mound the flooring was not so even, not as the rest, but it seemed lumped as if someone had dumped potting soil here and there in small amounts until it had been spread so evenly beyond it that one could not tell the difference in such darkness. It struck her as an odd sight until she realized. Her pallor, already pale within the starlight of the spell that Vith cast, was now completely faded. Ghostlike in appearance she forgot to breath because so many breaths had been last cast within this room. So much pain had been experienced in this room.

How could that be? \"Yes, let's not.\" he said and dimmed the light. \"However... you said you felt nothing else alive in the city, I wonder why these live here when there are no rats, birds or even plants above?\" he mused continuing a little as he kept his eyes out for more bats. \"But if bats live down here, we know it isn't magic keeping life away and we may find other living beings here.\" he suggested. The water soaking walls and floor was curious to Vithkun - this deep and they had made a contraption this meaningless? Drains and whatnot for what purpose? It had to have a purpose however and that meant that something important lay ahead. \"What is this place..?\" Vithkun initially asked and instinctively empowered the light that came from the carved wooden stick to almost fill the entirety of the room and followed Myra through the room. \"This is an odd place for a gathering room.\" he concluded quite quickly starting to think the drows making this had not been among the smartest of their kin.Approaching the mound Vithkun noticed it also and bowed down taking some of it between his fingers to feel it - rising quickly a similar pale color appeared in his expression as Myra in the same moment called out what had become obvious. Paranoid he looked around the room remembering that someone - or something - had lead them down here before looking at Myra with a face of agony. \"This is not ash, it's death...\" he said appalled by the sight which was quite likely a tomb of the inhabitants that used to live here. \"Alright, let's not get carried away, we don't know for sure, if this as any connection with the loss of life here.\" he would reason to calm himself and Myra putting a hand around her as she grabbed him, however his mind was still affixed to any movements around the room.

Vithkun nodded at Myra explaining the plan, understanding what she meant by it as he grasped his sword placing the tip on the floor. \"I'll need to carve out the pattern, but initially it will be with little strain to myself by putting only traces of light into it and then afterwards I can add the needed power to the already created symbol in the ground.\" Vithkun said, and as he traced the tip of the sword along the ground a very thin line of light would follow the carved groove. Concentrating on creating the pattern the original Myra's talking to him was but a distraction, and he continued to put most of his concentration in the work he was doing. \"You overstayed your welcome by a lot, so you may have missed a few things while being held up here.\" Vithkun simply answered - no smirk and no jest in his eyes. \"Myra is precious to me and to me there is nothing to overlook, because the faults you may see are strengths that have only served to guide her in the opposite direction of the path you've taken.\" Vithkun said and stopped just for a moment to lock eyes with her. \"I suggest you use your remaining time here to think of a suitable apology to tell, not only these people, but the great maker when you stand before that which has given you your essence.\" he said, his words hard but also covering for the sadness he felt when she spoke, no elf should be as hard-hearted as to dismiss one's mistakes when facing the time when they would be merging with the stars again.

He might neglect such honesty in the face of his own courts but his understanding now and his willingness to do so was a trait she could not deny she herself admired. \"You are wrong,\" Myra would tell her ancestor not looking to her for approval in this matter, \"We are made of light just as they are. We belong as one people who accept that there is but little difference between us than pigment of skin and our choices that led us astray. Our eyes may not adjust so easily to the light but we should be guided by theirs and they should follow us into the darkness when it is necessary.

Facing her with her back to Vith she looked to the youngling, \"Then continue to prove it.\"Myra while surprised was given little time to contemplate her surprise for she was brought back further by the hands of those around her, it seemed some were capable of still touching the living but while those were a select few all could speak. There were murmurs of thanks as they passed. One paused and spoke to her privately but Vith could not hear what they spoke to her for as they crowded into the circle, condensing themselves he received the same general comments of thanks. One woman who appeared middle aged placed a hand upon his shoulder, she spoke in a sweet gentle voice, \"We were given hope once, and it was almost lost in the years of solitude here, you give us hope again.

Such willpower and belief in oneself was admirable when used towards a worthy goal, but when guided by a misunderstanding of what was right, it could be a horrible influence as demonstrated by it bringing her to this place. Perhaps however there was equal glory to overcoming such a powerful inner drive and turning it to something better - and Vithkun could at least respect her doing that. As Vithkun continued to draw the pattern Myra would not see it, but a smirk build on his face complimenting her gainsaying her own ancestor by the right of simply 'being right'. It was will power used correctly and ironically this was a light that burned within her, a light that was of the same as his but a flame shaped differently for drow people to follow. A black flame it was, but not one to hurt. Rather the white light of the pure elves was that of ambition and truth, while the black fire inside Myra symbolized relentlessness and compassion - how would her plan of merging these perfectly compatible forces not succeed? Vithkun shook his head silently. Having carved the pattern to his relative satisfaction, he sheathed his sword, the thin lines of light remaining and just waiting the power of the jewel to run through him and start the ceremony to release the drow-kin to their lives beyond life and he nodded at Myra. \"We're about ready soon.\" he'd say and took a deep breath when he noticed a hand on his shoulder, almost jumping as it felt - alive. An old drow looked at him smiling and complimenting him. \"I'm honored - Kidred...\" Vithkun said and smiled back softly putting his own hand upon hers hearing her last words. \"I will take care of her, I believe she carries a very certain gift from the Boundless Will.\" he answered as he released her hand again and stepped out of the pattern he had drawn allowing the shades to gather inside it and on the mound. \"You carry the jewel and their fate - be their guide.\" Vithkun proposed holding out his hand for her to take in order to initiate the ritual.

To even spark hope in an afterlife and not an eternal end was enough to give them back the joy they had lost so long ago. As they had before now they willingly stepped forth and Myra took Vith's hand channeling power through the both of them. With her free one she plucked the jewel from around her neck holding it in her palm. Vith had offered his protection once but this thing, while it had been powered by the darkest of magic, had been fed the brightest of souls who volunteered their lives in order to save others. Self sacrifice was one of the greatest deeds that could ever be done and she found it not abhorrent, saddening, but it was beautiful because it had not inherited the darkness of what occurred to form it. It had kept their hope within it. As would she. Speaking in the tongue of the old Drow she would tell them, \"May you be guided by the light of Aleath,\" Vith had once told her in the night that their star, one she began to recognize as their own, was named Izale, and looking to him she switched to the beauty of elvish, \"And know it is also theirs, Izale's blessings be upon you as well.\" With that she her fingers curled around the stone the facets cutting into skin but drawing no blood as she in one deep breath reached out to each of them, it happened all at once as she found the link in the chain, Myralthrine, who lit everyone with her own light, they bathed in it and when she made contact there was a sudden release as if a pressure seal had gave way and they began to fade into nothingness, \"Now,\" she spoke with urgency but not with volume as she looked to Vith a spark of power passing between their palms.

Quite another story would it be with Myra, one of the other guards looking at the fainted drow. \"We'll just drop her there, and see if she wakes up then..?\" he said and scratched his head poking the half dead drow with the blunt end of his halberd. \"She likely doesn't deserve it, but we'll have keep her alive so we can figure out what happened and she can take her due punishment.\" the first guards answered and sighed. \"Bring a stretcher, some water and a healer..!\" he yelled, the others slightly surprised but complied nonetheless.Thus Myra was shackled on feet and legs with light yet very sturdy metal cuffs of elven make before she was relieved of her mace and what other weapons she had on her - the Crimson Ascend confiscated as well, yet as it was taken off her it neither radiated magic nor light in any way different than a normal pendant. Being not in the grasp of someone it belonged to, seemed to have it hide its powers. The drow would be placed inside a cell that contained none of the elegant features or dazzling comforts of the elves and only a wooden bench for sleeping, a bucket and a high window with bars. The main door was bared too and the walls and ceiling made of hard rock - rock that that vibrated in tune with magic and echoed back in an opposite frequency effectively suppressing magic to a minimal fraction of what it could have been. This also put an immense strain on the user to even focus it into something useful. Looking between the bars to the door to the right there would be a hallway with other prisons and the wall to the left indicating this was the last of them. Myra had been stabilized and through their skillful magic brought back to a condition where she wouldn't die at least, and a plate consisting of bread, a bowl of cold soup and a bottle of water had been placed inside the cell along with a small lantern for light. Still shackled, Myra would find herself waking up on the partly hay covered floor with the moon shining through the bared window in a room about fifty square feet and slightly rectangular. Low in energy she would need time and food to recover to a state resembling her normal, yet it was not a long time after she had awoken that the deadening silence of the cell was broken by a steel door creaking open further down the hallway.

They possible expected her to escape with magic and not with anything so simple as a needle that she could move the tumblers one by one until she felt the right amount of resistance.

The library had been sealed for a reason  and if it was ancient as he said perhaps it would contain the truth of her ancestory once and for all, or at least answer the questions about Myralthine\u2019s original fate and if it were truly the one she presented before. Rising at midnight she began her attempt, at first she was going to attempt to pick the lock but after holding onto the needle she felt a vibration of magic within it. Just a hint but it was the string that after she stretched it she felt it. Wondering at the capability of it she thought back to the advice given and it clicked. Sliding it around her ankle she pulled the string through and then upward from the needle and the opposite side. It broke the shackle like butter slipping through the metal and shearing it. \u201cGandrys you must be gifted,\u201d she murmured to no one but herself as she repeated it on her hands and the other foot. Going out the main door would be quite obvious and if the library was below her perhaps she could climb down. Going to the window bars she would worked loose the side two with just enough room to slide through and a way to set them back into place when she returned. The crimes she was being held captive for would not be easily over looked to start much less if she disappeared from her cell and never returned. Getting out through the window required a feat of strength but she did her best to muster it glancing down to a foothold before the attempt was made.Her magic was muted within the cell but once free of the cage itself she would send out her own mind mapping out the location of the guards and any of those below on the path to what she had to assume was the library as it was the largest place void of life.

As Myra fixed her eyes upon the pages she would be drawn in immediately, yet it was a gentle draw and images and words started forming in her head with far more clarity than before - surroundings and people's faces easily recognizable. Myra would see a small garden in what was definitely the citadel in Azela. A woman pregnant in her late months watering some flowers and another drow walking up behind her and wrapping his hands around her. \"Should you be doing that still?\" he asked softly kissing her on her cheek, a smile rose on the woman's soft features. \"Have you found a name yet, Yazale dear?\" he asked then as she put her watering can down as her cheeks gently blushed. \"The stars have told us that it will be a she...

But dark clouds swooped in over her vision, the music in the background playing the same tune, yet it sounded more somber and desolate as rocky tunnels deep within the ground seemed to amuse thoughts of despair and hopelessness. A drow guard marching down the hall carrying a loaf of bread and a chicken leg stopping at a cell. Another drow sits behind the bars, the only prisoner on the hallway, as the guards tossed the food into his cell unceremoniously. \"It's a gift from the council, Mithral.\" he said and frowned as the man moved quickly up to the bars grasping them with both his fists while pressing his face to it. A face very like the former scene, yet this one looked distressed and malnourished. \"Just for once tell me about my daughter..! Tell me about Myra - tell me that she's alive, and then they can do whatever you want with me..!\" he pleaded, although his eyes carried still fire in them, but the guard just shrugged and turned from the prisoner. \"The council already does whatever they want with you...\" he said and left the prisoner, as Myra would find herself being drawn back from the book's enthralling story telling yet the music still played.

He\u2019d shown her the joy that could be found in exploration of one another and even though both were unwise to attempt such with him injured and her barely moving they came together in a slow sweet exploration that was careful, and precise, and left them both snuggled beneath the covers in the cell neither having given much consideration to the location of their love making other than making sure he did not tear open that which had begun to heal and her warning him against such while he shushed her by claiming her lips and keeping her from speaking for a short while.

Listening to Myra, Vithkun was surprised and shook his head as he realized she had broken out of the jail just so that she might gain some info from an old library. She was plucky as ever, even as she had been on the verge of exhaustion. \"I will put in words for Marchus - I must have been gone when it happened, because I thought he had left again.\" Vithkun said, surprised and happy to hear that he was still alive, as he had met the human before and talked with him a few centuries ago.

Even now she was on a precipice of uncertainty when he spoke of acknowledgment for he'd eased her worries with Marchus almost immediately. Truths long denied were hard to break and her worry for a man she had never met was born out of imagery she could never forget. Within that city they had found two books that brooked no argument against her lineage. Magicked in such a way as to immediately possess a current likeness of the living within those pages there was one unable to be ignored. Her own. Before that were two others, a woman who had since left the vales and valleys of their world for another, and a man whom she had only glanced at the picture and not the dates beneath it to surmise his fate. What sort of cruel gesture was it now for her to learn there might not be a second one along with the first, and what sort of gift it could be to meet the man who she might call father. One who while he lingered in a cell asked after his daughter first and foremost. He would acknowledge her, know her to be his, and yet even now he rested within a cell and she agreed that time had to be spent here. Not wasted, no, for to seek his freedom meant a battle. Whether it was of words or blood was yet to be decided and the foundation for either would be laid here, between them as he asked of her a question in which she could only shake her head. No, she sought no acknowledgment, not before, and not after, but it would come with time. \"Before you knew of it you yourself did so,\" she reinforced her decision by rightfully pointing out what had led to this very moment, \"I seek nothing but the safety of a man wrongly imprisoned and if it means hardship upon myself I will face it. I only feel sorry for what this will mean for you in return.\" Vith seemed to pay it no heed rather taunting her about the color of her hair while she narrowed her gaze by glaring at him only to break out in a good natured smile, \"I do not think that golden locks would truly fit my disposition,\" joking again it was slid in so effortlessly as she took the bottle from him taking a small sip before answering, \"Black would be best. It is the more common color.\" When the sun rose in the morning and filtered through the bars only one shown so brightly in the streams of light. Her new hair was as black as the ravens wings were long and sucked in the light giving it nowhere to gleam upon her countenance. Bathing she would scrub dye off of her hands and take what little remained loose among her hair out but it did not change the color, and Vith had done quite the job making sure it was truly well and done all around. A few weeks would betray her original and if necessary they would redo it in order to fool not only elves, but drow, into thinking she was but a commoner. Her name was also a weakness, and before they left she looked within the book finding her father. She had surmised correctly, there was no end date beside his name but in the center of hers rested a middle name, Karise, sliding the marker down the middle she would inform Vith of the name and her recommendation that he use her own only when they were alone. It was not a common name, her first, for no one would take it by choice and it was a wonder she was allowed to keep it, but perhaps it was because it was the final wish of her mother. Settled in her saddle she noticed Vith moved with grace again, and an ease she could not have expected but enjoyed and with his good nature returned she would wholeheartedly agree, \"I will do my best to imagine it so.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Resolving her ancestry by an aversion to traveling the known path and a horse that disliked Vithkun enough to have bolted was an odd confirmation of everything had occurred.

Rather it was elegant, silent for now, but its stores beautifully painted and with many differently shaped flowers and plants hanging from the ornamented balconies and the neatly pattered facades genuinely welcoming one to step inside. \"Oh let's make a stop here, it's been so long!\" Vithkun said with a broad smile. \"I think we both are in the need of new clothes, wouldn't you say? Making the right impression is going to count for something.\" Vithkun suggested, as Vithkun had bled on his own and they had both sweat and slept in them in the hay and little spots of dye were present on his sleeves even. \"Yeah I look like a vagabond, and somehow I've managed to get to this place without caring too much.\" his eyes raising from his clothes, jestingly blaming Myra for teaching her such negligence through being so practical and down to earth. \"Come, let's go!

However moving through the the stands and mannequins a desk stood at the back of the room with no direct view of the door. Stepping out behind a mannequin with an expansive, white dress Vith would silently drag Myra along by her hand giving her a soft smile as they stepped up before the counter. An elf lady with her blonde hair done into a long, dutch braid lifting her long lashed eyes splayed out upon them and red lips curling into a curious smile. As she stepped out onto the floor to face them, the ornamented red and white dress showed itself fully with flowing sleeves tracing the elegant movements of her arms. \"Well, well... if it isn't the prince..?\" she said inclining her body a bit putting her hand in her side, painted nails showing and eyes studying the elf from top till toe. Her gaze lingered slightly longer than was perhaps decent for a shop assistant, and her expression told of subtle satisfaction. \"Ahh, Delene it's been a while...\" Vithkun said his smile half strained before he turned to Myra, drawing her out in front beside him if she was shy. \"This is...\" Vith said and swallowed his words as her was about to form his lips. \"... Karise. She's been my loyal companion for a long quest and I'm showing her my home as thanks.\" Vithkun said, his half baked excuse sure to by punched through eventually - he had to do better later, but it was a lesson. Delene's gaze moved curiously to Myra as her eyes discretely widened with her curiosity. \"Well I'm very pleased yo meet you!\" she went, her voice genuine but it was also carrying a bit of... animosity was not the word, rather competitiveness would be a better one. She looked at Myra's clothes too and then back at Vith crossing her arms and tapped her foot. \"How did you even manage to get here looking like that?\" she went, her voice serious yet friendly.

As it was now, the black locks drawn into a chignon style at the nape of her neck to keep them out of the way and to keep her from realizing they were black. When they passed a mirror or window she caught her reflection and it caught her off guard the strange color making her feel as if another was staring back instead. She shuddered to think what it might have been had Myralthrine herself had darker locks for she surely then would have felt out of character. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to keep me indoors if you want to keep that from happening,\u201d she was serious too, for the branches seemed to reach for her and nature called in ways that most elves had to work hard to achieve. Her symbiotic relationship with it was born of necessity and a childhood spent among the trees and away from people communing with nature instead of communicating. Not that she was unable, she just preferred their words to most humanoids. Other than Vith, who while quite loquacious drew her attention none the less. Entering the shop she was apprehensive to touch anything, her hands and clothing were clean but this was far beyond any of her normal wear even when she\u2019d been in her nicest. The road did not treat clothes kindly and she inwardly would have been horrified of the cost. Recognizing colors and patterns of noblemans dress clothes and dresses that would suit a lady of the lower and higher court she felt all of it was a bit to far from her normal. Then again when Vithkun pulled her forward grasping her hand in excitement she knew this would soon be her new normal, that escaping to the outskirts of the world where no one bothered her but a stray deer was no longer an option. Did she wish for the quiet of it? One look at her companion and she knew that she would follow his steps into the very darkest pits of hell and move through the fire in order to secure his wellbeing and his happiness but her own was important as well and she would not compromise who she was fully for it would negate who he began to love. Brought forward around Vith they met a slip of a girl dressed in white and red with painted lips and curled lashes. Her countenance was one of finery and her looks crafted through careful examination in a mirror. Karise, as she had to be called now, could suddenly see why Vith had called himself scruffy and might consider her so as well. It took her aback to see such so openly. A feeling of inadequacy flushed her cheeks as she glanced to the woman introduced as Delene. Delene might find her a curiosity but though she wore clothes not suitable to her station she could not find her ugly at the very least. Delene found her to be well built, the legs of a woman who used them often, arms that showed strength but were not unfeminine, and features crafted of royalty with a high cheek and sharp chin that was raised to withstand the onslaught of her gaze. Karise had found Delene to be slim, languorous in her appearance, painted and adorned, and beautifully kept together by her clothing that was made to compliment her form. Karise found her like the willow, and Delene, despite her observations, would probably think of Karise as fit for a donkey for she was stout but capable. Karise did not miss the long glance, as she had been half hidden behind her companion and able to rather quickly take in how the woman acted before she was fully visible. Unrelenting in some aspects she did not release Vith\u2019s hand for it was part of staking a claim that would start here and now. If they were to tread this path it would have to be done with as much of the truth implied as possible. Karise did not offer a hand, nor any open sign of disregard, her expression was as serene as deep water, the surface was calm and steady, beneath, well what lied in the depths was unknown. \u201cIt is a pleasure to meet you as well,\u201d she acquiesced her tone level but not unfriendly, \u201cI am afraid that his state of dress is rather my doing,\u201d she confessed this giving Vith a sideways glance her eyes falling to his lips before raising to his eyes, \u201cI insisted our travel take us on a route of exploration and it came with some difficulties as to the path.\u201d ", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\u201cI\u2019m mean,\u201d sending his words back with the same good humor that he distributed them with as he spoke of being scruffy she purposefully messed his hair in the wrong direction saying with a snort, \u201cIt\u2019s an attractive scruffy,\u201d reassuring him of this at least while he possibly was sorting out the locks that were almost tangled by her stray hand wandering over them keeping them from looking as pristine as they had when he brushed them out earlier.

Yes, she was quite the good looking girl, she had to admit that. Even for a drow she had a certain graceful presence and dignity, one she had not expected from a common drow adventurer. Nodding Delene turned around and reach behind the counter to bring out a measuring stick and a small notebook. \"It's not every day I get to match the color of blueberry with my clothes. It's a challenge, but I'll make it work alright.\" she said to Myra giving her a fair but measured smile before turning to Vith. Quite abruptly she wrapped her fingers around his arm and pulled him gently but firmly from Myra, Vithkun following Delene, as she helped him off with his outer jacket, hanging it on a nearby chair. \"Arms out..!\" the elf said before taking her time to measure him looking quite comfortable around Vithkun - eyes inspecting and gentle touches seemed to be placed a little more often than a stranger would. \"Well ehrm... thanks Delene, it doesn't have to be tailor made this time...\" Vihtkun would say, as he stood front to Myra having a difficult time knowing where to place his eyes. \"We need to be accurate in order to find the right clothes for you... your majesty.\" her last words spoken rather teasingly and her smirk attempted covered by standing on his backside with him between Vithkun and Karise. \"I've never seen the Thousand Lights Halls myself before but I've been told it was quite beautiful.\" Delene addressed Myra, but side eyed Vithkun who's cheeks blushed slightly as she casually put a hand on his shoulder. \"Once I was close though... I handsome elf promised me to show me that and much more, but it ended a little prematurely.\" Delene said casually and shrugged, though her smile had strained some - Vithkun taciturn for once. \"Arms out please.\" she'd say to Myra after having noted the last measurements of Vithkun.

Would it..?\" she asked as Vithkun nodded and he couldn't but grin. \"It would..!\" he whispered back to Delene, who moved over to Myra's dressing room and knocked carefully - opening the door just slightly stretching her arm in with the dress. \"You have to try this also.\" she insisted and glanced inside, remembering that she hadn't told Myra about the mirror - which was well known by elves bu not outside High Haven. \"You can change the light and shadow by moving your hand up and down before the mirror, so they'll appear as they would in different circumstances. Try it out!\" she'd encourage Myra and pull back out of the dressing room where she'd wait with Vith outside for Myra to pop back out - only scarce glances glances shared by the two, Delene obviously trying not to let her eyes prey too much on the elf. \"You look very handsome in that - it's a nice fit.\" she'd comment politely, a measured way she only rarely spoke. \"Thank you, it's been a while. Your craft is excellent as always.\" he returned her praise, the female elf's cheeks slightly glowed as Delene suppressed a smile.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Inside the dressing rooms, which they had not chosen to be right next to each other, simply there were only these, a large oval mirror was there for the customer to inspect one's dress and how it fitted.

It was with a heavy heart she knew that change was coming for in her reflection there were things that bore admitting.For to her dismay and joy, she did like the dress. The fabric was light and fluid around her form seeming to move with her. There were two layers with one more akin to a shift and one sheerer but a mix of purple and blue that was laid over periwinkle giving it an almost blueberry-esque hue that Delene so quickly commented upon earlier. It was not one shade but broken by the periwinkle in the center with a band that met beneath her breasts with a beweled broach before it slid downward on either side at a downward angle covering the sides of the dress and the back. Above it was the same simple two shifting fabrics with the same bejeweled style wrapping around her upper arms. It was not perhaps as complicated as the others and with a banana boat neckline, it concealed much that the other had not, allowing her to drop the Crimson Ascent beneath the fabric. Before they departed she would not only take Vith's hand but also Delene's if only for a moment, \"I will not forget your kindness, thank you.\"How rare she believed it might have been within this Kingdom and yet it was visible in everyone that Vithkun had brought her to. It was an odd trait for him to have collected friends and family who were so open to change and knew that it was inevitable when he himself was so damning at first. Then again he'd agreed to accompany her where most would have scorned her immediately and never believed her words.

Being 'on top' and asserting one's social position through dominant verbal behavior was something quite prevalent between elves in High Haven and sometimes it was so culturally engraved, that it was considered rude not doing it. However Delene had snapped out of it, as the drow's 'down to earth' demeanor had awoken her memories of the world outside, and the fact that just speaking your mind in an straight forward way was often a much less complicated and more efficient way to communicate. But her last words pointed towards the fact that complex communication was very deeply engraved in Excelmere among the nobles - even to the point where it could be mistaken as being their sole purpose for getting out of bed in the morning. Spite was woven through elegant strings of words that would almost make you say 'thank you' and you'd be finding yourself doing favors for people you've just met, only from listening to the silver of their tongues. This was on Vithkun's mind too as he left, knowing exactly what they faced. But Myra had surprised him before and if there was any chance of anyone battering right through that, it lay with the drow and he gave her a loving sidelong glance as they were mounting their horses. \"Your reservations are duly noted, and I'd advise you to not easily let them drop.\" he gave her a wry smile. \"Delene is okay, but she's an elf and this is how elves communicate and maintain social status - simply by flexing their verbal muscles. Delene has been outside High Haven, but many haven't and don't know that there is a different kind of communication. Don't judge them too hard, but also don't get taken in by either flattery nor criticism, it's only a way to position themselves politically and socially.\" he advised Myra and a long, but perhaps much needed, explanation and warning about the palace in particular. \"Only if they choose to be alone with you, are you sure that they trust you, and even then truths may be blended with half truths to serve their cause.\" he explained.\"Elves' biggest sins are not lying though, it's the sin of failing to see the other side of the coin - if you remember this, you'll be alright. An elf that admits another side of the truth, is a wise and trustworthy one.\" he said and looked at Myra with a wry grin. \"I wasn't always like that, was I?\" he asked jestingly, well aware of this. \"Be ware that calling me wise right now, might cause me to fall down the horse like a fool!\" he said and chuckled, before they passed the bridge that lead from the walled mercantile area of Excelmere to the more lush, rich and expressive part of the city.\"This part of the city is the jewel, every plant is as old as the mountains and have roots deep inside the grounds. Nobility live here, but servants and laborers live here in almost equal luxury as the nature magic of High Haven is more prevalent here than almost anywhere else in High Haven.\" he explained as they passed lavishly built houses that seemed almost knitted into the nature - yet perfectly distinguishable. They were not build for practicality nor protection, for nature here was benevolent always and beauty beat practicality any day. The structures awoke such awe, that one could easily be caught speechless just by casting eyes on the may layered and twisted monuments of elven pride and lavish, where little gardens, rivers and waterfalls of splendor arose in unique ways everywhere. The two elves were starting to get attention for the noble and common folk on the roads - no one yelling nor pointing, yet they were seen. Their prince, whom they had not seen for a full year, had returned, followed by a drow! One however that looked every bit like a drow queen as the elven horse almost proudly bore her along, the dress accentuating her noble features. To ride alongside the prince was one thing - almost impossibly rude for someone like that - yet she carried herself with such ease and elegance that the dusky woman looked like she almost belonged by his side. But as they crossed through the final neighborhood before starting their ascend towards the halls of the castle, they were met by a slim built elf on his almost completely white horse along with six elven soldiers clad in immaculate shiny plate armor that undulated around their bodies like flames of otherworldly metal. \"Welcome back to Excelmere, the Thousand Lights Hall and your father awaits you.\" he said and bowed his head to the prince, his long blonde hair falling forwards before he lifted his head again looking at Myra. \"And who... rides level with his majesty..?\" the elf's words were cold as he narrowed his eyes, presenting not even his name to her. However much Vithkun wanted to present her, she needed to do it herself - presenting her would only strengthen Head Captain Garda's silent critique of Myra. Thus Vithkun simply looked at the head captain acknowledging his presence and greeting, yet sparing him no words right now - as was expected from the prince by everyone there.

Vith\u2019s layers were drawn back slowly but almost completely causing a change in the boy who became a man by understanding a different point of view, one that now allowed him to proudly ride beside a Drow who until but a week ago had been but a poor orphan and the lowest of society.

Their journey had been spent side by side with neither taking a lead to be better than the other nor neither needing such pretense outside of the shimmering enchantments that so concealed the elven world from the human one. Pride might be the downfall of a lesser woman but it lifted her up to sit high and well within her seat, and even when she answered Vith, his warnings not forgotten, she would say softly, \u201cYou are now,\u201d taking his hand within hers by reaching across she meant her words blue eyes locking onto him with an intensity of transformation beneath their depths, \u201cWe have grown in the presence of one another, you have taught me much Vithkun Almear,\u201d she used his full name as a sign of respect and to fully garner his attention to her words, \u201cNot the least of which is that one cannot truly judge a book by its cover. Though I fear we carry one with us that will be judged thoroughly by its contents.\u201d\u00a0Speaking of her ancestors they did carry the lineage of the Drow. The spells would be tested over the pages, found to be true and bearing all that was right about her lineage as well as his own. For it would be found to bewitched by a talented castor the spellbinding not changed for thousands of years and carrying secrets many would choose not to reveal. Myralthrine\u2019s lineage did not coincide with Vith\u2019s for their ancestors had no children but were he to search hard and long enough they would find Drow intertwined with Elf in the line of both royal families within the history of the ages. Both shared more of another than the might ever realize even if it was but a truly distant relation.\u00a0Releasing him as his kin came to realize their presence among them he would face enough of their judgement without her carrying on now in order to prove a point, or lose a point in her favor. Presenting herself as well as possible included conforming to their lack of understanding if only until they could be together again, alone, where pretending need not be the order of the day.\u00a0Discovering his home was to discern what lay within the architecture of their society. The fabric of life here was multifaceted and colorful deigning to serve no purpose than to promote a lack of the unsightly. No one might claim anything to be displeasing to the eye only to the use of ones hands. Unsuitable for human use, too unuseful to dwarves, and too wild for the Drow. It was if nothing else a pure representation of how absolutely full of themselves elves could be but in such imagery lied their true seduction for elves were not meant to be serious or understood. Their mystery lied in the glamour of their presentation. In the rising fall of their voices as they sang or spoke cloaking insults in seduction and in an opposite fashion giving a compliment wrapped in so much complexity one might never uncover its true meaning. It was picturesque and while Myra was loathe to admit it she found it charming.\u00a0Entranced so by the world around her there was a small voice whispering in her mind to bring herself back down to the earth. To remember that all things were rooted and so should she be and keep her mouth shut instead of her jaw becoming unhinged in her need to seek out the line of every home as it began. Soon surrounded by elves who found her as interesting as she them she found it within herself to keep her eyes forward, barely looking to Vith unless he spoke directly to her, and but rarely looking away from the road keeping herself haughty in manner but endearing them to a view of her features that would not deny her royalty if only in looks. Approached by the guard he greeted his majesty first, the returning prince a spectacle that drew notice without a secondary rider. The recognition of a second might have been foregone if not for her pale skin the grey tinge and tinted cheeks having not been seen openly riding upon these roads for thousands of years. Much less having ridden beside a prince so openly. Vithkun prepared her as much as he was able. It warranted mentioning he had done most of it that morning as he hoped before to have impressively swooped in and saved her by making certain she was treated with respect. His naivety placed her in danger upon their arrival to the city but while blame had been openly shared and then dismissed it could not happen again. Myra spoke in a clear dialect, no fault found in the way her mouth formed the words the only accent upon her name and the way she pronounced Host, not unlike Haust in the true pronunciation, \u201cI am Karise of Host,\u201d she spoke openly, brightly, without fear nor concern for if she was to be who she was it was going to be unapologetic in every way, shape, and form, \u201cI accompany his majesty out of his kindness and intent on repaying deeds not long since passed in his absence from the hallowed halls of his forefathers.\u201d Garda\u2019s hair was long, and bright, and beautifully shimmering in the sun while her hair was of raven black painted by magic. It remained so the darker locks complimenting darker skin hiding what lay beneath but nothing could hide her eyes.

The soul was less forgiving in its display of emotions and while she kept her power tempered she had allowed it to roam freely among the crowd on their way to the palace. There was disgust, curiosity, irritation, rage fueled by misunderstanding. A few times did she feel something of true worth and beauty in their opinion towards her but it was fleeting and swayed easily by the opinions of others. Curiosity had been overwhelming and she hoped within that one fleeting moment there was the ability to change. The scenery continued to be overwhelmingly gorgeous. It was beginning to be like a single grain of sand in a very uncomfortable spot digging and irritating and unable to be gotten out. \u201cThank you,\u201d she told Garda for his part in leading them there, for even if his manners had failed him hers could not for her behavior would be scrutinized. The Crimson Ascent now openly showing upon her even if her name meant very little she carried a prize denied to most elves who sought it and it would garner her some respect if nothing else as it truly wished to be recognized now. As they departed from the two guards waiting to take them back and passed from their vision into some shrubbery blocking the entrance she would squeeze his hand lightly, for while he watched her so did she watch him and would say in muted tones, \u201cI know what it means to you to see him again under such duress but even if I cannot ease the pain of bringing me here for you I will be here for you, always.\u201dChoosing to allow Vith to enter first he might have opened the door for her but a servant did so, a wide eyed raven wonder who was blessed with more happy manners than Garda and showed them down to the veranda where he currently resided.

It held seating made of the world and of craftsman and a man who when they emerged was leaned over a rail his hands gripping the side of it. Myra observed him quietly noting his shoulders were slightly broader than his brothers, being first born he would need such to handle what he believed might be his coronation. Myra supported Vithkun for his ability to change well before it began to effect their own relationship as it were and she only hoped that with what came they would be strong enough, both his brothers shoulders and their own, to handle the onslaught of change. His hair was pale, breathtakingly bright within the few steams of light that fell through and when he turned the same haughty features of Vith seemed mirrored, not quite twins but the relation of brotherhood was seen easily. His eyes were a darker blue than his brothers, like the ocean depths instead of the clear serenity of Caribbean waters.

'Confident, ally and brother'...

Many left our fair home seeking it and of those few returned and among them they spouted nothing but nonsense about it being unattainable and unfindable. My doubt lies in the disappearance of our dear grandfather, he never returned from such a quest himself.\u201d\u00a0The moment that the boy prince had asked for wine the servant who escorted them through the halls had appeared out of an outcrop with what Cass would call, \u201cA very favored vintage as it was sung to by Celanat,\u201d Vith might recognize the name as one of the most praised in her ability to sing to nature. Such was her gift that one might begin to wander of her lineage but she could only make the vines grow full and fat and aplenty with no malice in her gift.\u00a0Myralthrine had been situated upon the side she appeared and the raven haired beauty had been intensely quiet as she floated past but a hairswidth away from the woman that Vith supported highly in word about her rather physical accomplishments. Not easily spooked, mainly for she was still keeping tabs on all around her, she\u2019d never even looked at the woman until she passed back by her elbow this time attempting to jostle her by touching theirs together. Myra avoided it easily by half turning to watch her meaning her back was to Vith and she only half faced his brother. Returning to the conversation at hand after the elf was disappointed at her failure there was a small table on which she placed a decanter and three glasses. It appeared she feared her master enough to know not to slight a guest and had poured all three in equal measure settling them very evenly across the edge of the table. It was meant to be so that Cass would take the one closest to him, Myra the one on the very left, and Vith was near the center.\u00a0Cass spoke not unkindly waving to the wine, \u201cYou are as always welcome to the comforts of my home and all it has to offer, as is Karise as my way of showing gratitude for making sure that you returned safely. I am sure you both have quite the tale to weave over the time you have been gone.

No callouses decorated the pads of his hands for he had one of the healers cover them with a layer of skin to soften his touch and lighten his soul when he took to painting for he wished to be able to feel the texture of what he worked with.

The elves were nothing if not impractical in nature their very homes barely allowing one to live in them without subduing ones own needs for the pleasure of the view.\u00a0Her flushed cheeks had faded now she began weeding and pruning the garden of understanding surrounding his brother. Cass, to Myra, had spoken so clearly and sweetly and sought his brothers good word but there was rivalry there, there must be, for both were fighting for the same crown.

A quick frown appeared on his face, but Myra dealt with the situation elegantly and he relaxed again. \"You are most welcoming, brother, however I think we will retreat to my own home.

He had however also an eye on the wine and something inside him stirred as the servant put them on the table obviously arranged for each of them. \"Oh Karise, wait a moment!\" he said and reached for her glass. \"I'm afraid a small fly has taken to land in your wine, and we can't have that be your first experience with Cass' wine, can we?\" he said with a jolly voice, pretending to pick up the fly with his index finger flicking it to the floor. \"Here take my glass instead.\" he insisted and pushed his own glass towards Myra with a polite smile hoping none of them noticed, yet Myra was probably too perceptive not to. \"Well if you think we speak too much of you, then let's have a taste of the wine!\" he proposed and lifted his glass glancing at both Cass, Myra and - very quickly - the servant girl as he put the wine to his lips and tasted it, looking for any tells from her expression.

No I shall wait to be in the same company if only to give father a chance to form his own opinions.\u201d\u00a0Myra being reluctant would not change matters and she would nod once at his words, \u201cIt will not do to keep them waiting,\u201d in all honesty she would have assumed that due regard demanded them to give first rights to his father but the decision had not laid within her hands.\u00a0\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Cass knew better than to draw insult or seek argument for further explanation for their ventures for the moment.

She felt he would be disappointed if she lost her temper again but it appeared that her powers were not the only thing that sparked the rare change in appearance. Truly it was alarmingly more apparent under stress and surprising that Vithkun had never sparked the reaction himself. Then again from the moment she'd met him there was something stirring beneath her skin and shifting in her mind to where she'd never view the world the same again, he'd turned it upside down, \"Only forward,\" she would say with a strained smile, \"It seems were developing a pattern.\"Cass before the two could make their leave had nodded once at his gratefulness at him accepting the wine before he pondered at the meaning of both their words about the dwarves. Had traveling truly changed his brother? Or did she? Cass felt confused at the show but his curiosity could be settled in other ways, \"You will fare far better without my presence there. Father has sent me away to solve the mystery that is the missing Lady Ayana. Her disappearance has certainly baffled all of us. Without the Lady Karise at your side I am sure that you would be asked to attend to it with me.\" Was that true sorrow in his voice, or something false, Myra could not tell for his emotions changed so quickly and were almost fleeting. Did the man decide on anything or was he attempting to confuse her. The way their eyes met earlier did not dissuade her of this. Settling down her glass half drank she did not wish to finish it. Instead, she would reach over her hand to Cass, she could not speak what she wished to for the truth would destroy whatever progress was made, \"I hope you find her,\" that was one thing she could honestly say for if it was foul play she needed to be found and if it was other reasoning that made her disappearance so untimely she wished to know it as well. Cass took her hand if only because to not do so would be unseemly and brought it upward kissing the back of it lightly, \"Thank you,\" he released it with a withdrawn look before he touched his brothers shoulder once more, \"Father will be pleased to see you but he is also worried for Ayana,\" he used her name informally, purposefully, \"Don't put more than you have to on his shoulders.\" Goodbyes and pleasantries abounding it appeared that even elves did not know how to say goodbye quickly. Myra might have made light of it after they left if there was not more on her mind. They would be meeting guards on their way out and speaking privately would be off the table for a short while.

'Try' was not an option with things being this important. As Myra and Vithkun bid Cassialus goodbye their purpose for coming to High Haven, and Excelmere in particular, was getting closer. The wind was in their back as if to encourage them, but they were both reluctant - and that was even as Vithkun knew that The Thousand Lights Hall were among the absolute wonders of this world. \"So Myra...\" he said and gave her a soft gaze as he spoke her name openly, the guards escorting them was a few paces behind and not able to hear their conversation. \"I love you. There is nothing inside High Haven I wouldn't share with you, but my father may not share my opinion, and even less chance of that is there among the court. So I suggest we keep this - potentially - upsetting reveal to a more private setting, right?\" he said with a wry smile as the made their way up to the large palace where the seat of power in High Haven was held - by one man seemingly, but not without the support of the many nobles on the court. Leaving the horses outside the palace both elf and drow would enter, the gate guards stepping aside well before they came close, bowing deeply as if it was expected that they would arrive. Inside they'd be lead through exquisitely ornamented tall white stone hallways and elven guards standing in the impressive mithril plated armors stood as paragons at every corner they reached. However the splendor of the hallways were nothing if not blown away by the true wonder that awaited them in the throne room. Stepping inside the would find themselves inside a gigantic orb like room, where a path of white oak tree reached out to a spacious plateau in the middle of the throne room, where a throne sat beneath a huge hand like branch of a tree extending above the plateau as if to shield it. The walls all around the plateau had small lights reflecting starlight from the bottom and sunlight from above - clear gems or crystals radiating the light which was both penetrating and life giving. Vithkun leaned to Myra to explain. \"The crystals are radiating starlight and sunlight from above and underneath depending on what time of the day it is. The throne is called 'The Crown of The World', which refers to the branch you see reaching up behind my father. The 'Crown' needs both starlight and sunlight all the time to be contained, and in The Thousand Lights Hall it is said that no true shadow can exist but the one the crown chooses to cast.\" he said and smiled briefly leading the two out on the path to the plateau in the middle, where a middle aged elf with slim yet timely elegant and firm features donning a silvery twisting crown on his head and sat, his chin supported by his fist and legs crossed. The red silken robes where exquisite and the golden details of the thread played in the light of the room, even as he sat in the soft shade of the extending branch. Well away to the right of Myra and Vithkun stood Garda quietly, and a couple of loyal guards flanked the throne while the king continued to observe Vith and the drow until they reached within proper distance to the throne - Selathil's ringed fingers tapped the wide armrest of the chair. \"Father, King Selathil Almear... I have returned to you.\" he said eyeing his father briefly, his quiet demeanor begging Vithkun for an explanation - implicitly scolding him also. \"This is my traveling companion, Karise of Host - she has played a central role in us acquiring... The Crimson Ascend.\" Vithkun said with a smirk, at least somewhat proud to return with such a treasure. \"It is a gem of such magnificence that its light outshines even this, combing both that of the stars and the sun in one light.\". He spoke and gave Myra a sidelong glance, expecting her to show the stone to his father. As he explained, and before Myra would show it, Selathil would lift a single brow in anticipation of what Vithkun had promised him, although it did not sit well with him that his son was not the one to show him such splendor. To see it from a drow was almost an insult - but those words were not spoken.\"My dear son Vithkun Almear, prince of High Haven...\" he said, his eyes crystal clear, gleaming with white, yet cool, light. \"Welcome home.\" he added after a pause to observe him further, leaving little attention upon the drow - though for seeing this amulet he did gaze at Karise. \"Karise of Host, show me what treasure my son has bestowed for your hands as safekeeping.\" he spoke, his sense of magical items already tingling at it being near, and he already desired to hold it himself and looked deep inside its light.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"Of course I understand...\" Vithkun lifted his downcast eyes and directed a genuine gaze at Cass putting his own hand on his shoulder. \"If this situation finds equilibrium soon, I certainly will help find Lady Ayana - she is a not a foolish elf, so I fear not for her safety, but rather for where her ambition and curiosity has taken her.\" he ended but waited for a moment to take the warning Cass gave him. \"Selathil has a lot on his shoulders, I'm very well aware.

His reassurances did not fall on deaf ears for when he spoke of his affections she did smile if a rather guarded one not fully looking to him as he spoke as to avoid the notice of the guards behind them. Logic in his words she found truth in them, blindingly bright truth that might threaten most, but after their journey she trusted him, implicitly, and knew he did this now only for his own sake but for hers as well. To be revealed so openly, and so soon, without giving her a chance to prove her mettle and have an opinion formed due to her own merit would destroy what progress was made. Therefore she would nod once speaking just as softly in return, \u201cI may not always appear patient but in some things I am capable.

Therefore they did so the Crimson Ascent having somehow found itself back beneath the cloth of her dress. It was as if the stone carried a mind of its own, Myra felt if she reached for it that it may possess the minds of many but she did not wish to face the onslaught so publicly nor without the aid of the man standing beside her as their practice with it would be done together. Patience had to extend to this as well.\u00a0No ill will came from the foliage of the palace itself, even the white oak tree seemed to acknowledge her presence without disdain for it. The age of the tree itself had her curious and she met its presence with her mind before the spirit of her gift. Most might commune with such a holy thing of the elves and she instantly withdrew every bit of power she had been extending the moment they passed through the doors. Left almost undefended with such drawn back her open use had been perhaps the reason her anger allowed her eyes to shift so quickly as if she might draw upon its power. The Crimson Ascent offered her a lifeline for power instead of drawing upon the world around her she could use that which was placed within it. Kacien\u2019s warning sat on the forefront of her mind, together, not apart, he had advised.\u00a0A sense of awe struck her no matter her attempt to avoid looking at the resplendent decoration of the throne room itself. Vithkun spoke of the beauty of all that existed within it. The crown may not be able to cast shadow within the realm of his choosing but it felt almost a challenge to her to prove the myth wrong of no shadows here for her own power could drive out both but for it to be so openly weilded would be beyond reproach. Made only abundantly more clear by his words for without the constant reach of the light surrounding their world the Crown itself would suffer, perhaps not a truth death if only for a short period of time but testing that theory was beyond her. Led into the light of the sun for it was cast high above the world she remained a half step behind Vithkun. Keeping their relationship out of the hands of those currently visiting the hall and his family until the time came brought some sacrifice and seeing as her position was lowly to stand beside him would be sacriligeous unless asked or motioned to do so she kept distance. Waiting for introductions to be cast when she was referred to she bowed, low and deep as was appropriate, she sought no insult just quite yet.\u00a0The amulet so hung around her neck was subdued for the moment. It had a sense of showmanship it appeared for when she reached upward taking the silver chain which was given from the deer in order to keep it safe, it would spark with life. Selathil could feel its grandeur without it being fully lit but as she drew it upward he would know his initial sense of the power within it was vastly underrated. The chain itself was brought to life shimmering as if imbued with starlight but the instant that the stone made itself clear it would take breath and sight away from all but the highest of elves. Myra looked to it openly for it did not burn her eyes to see it clearly now. The scarlet stone was multifaceted and when it hit the air it was as if it was infused with all of the light within the room stealing it and sealing it inside of the gem itself. It shone from the center before traveling outwards releasing its light back upon the branches of the tree. Then every line for which it had been cut glowed as if tinged with neon in a white light. Myra had lifted it upright to where it rested at the level of her chin. Even her gaze fell upon it while it shown with no equal but she saw not the brightness that others did, but instead it was dark, within the center was the blackest of holes until it released and then even she saw the lines of light around the cuts themselves, when she had drawn it upward she had spoken, with strength and a sense of security in her own self for the stone begged of her to present it with all she possessed and so with this held within her heart she would speak truly, \u201cWith pleasure, your Majesty.\u201d\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Recognizing the name of his father as spoken before Myra did not perk up or give the satisfaction of changing her expression to Cassialus, instead she rather politely finished their goodbyes her good form unruined by her tendency to want to punch high elves in the face.

It was absolutely awe inspiring. However Selathil did not squint - not in the slightest. Quite in the contrary he opened his eyes even wider trying to take it all in, even if he was pained trying to do so. Vithkun frowned a little. Was this his father's pride in refusing to have any drow outshine him in the way of light? Even so, it was impressive that he could look directly at it so intensely and not even blink or motion his hand towards his head. But then again he knew his father was something very special when it came to magic having peered into many otherworldly dimensions in search of knowledge and is a living oracle in the art of deducting magic and its workings from runes and inscriptions. Vithkun had not taught himself the art of inscription - his father had. \"It is... indeed a lovely gem, you've found there, my son.\" he finally said when he was done looking at it. \"I feel like I could stare into for millennia and still my curiosity would have not been sated in the slightest.\" his voice spoken was calm and measured, yet not hostile or demeaning. \"This indeed gives you the edge on your brother to stake a claim to both Ayana and the throne - yet of course that depends on two other things.\" his father stood up and gathered his hands behind his back as Vithkun frowned slightly. \"One is of course if we're ever going to see Ayana again - your brother has not been making much progress. The other being if you dare hang it around your own neck and claim it as what is rightfully yours.\" Selathil said eyeing also Myra for a brief moment. Vithkun peered down and blinked a couple of times before looking his father straight into the eyes, almost defiant. \"The gem was found by both of us and it is meant to be used by both of us - or else its powers will corrupt instead of create.\" he said firmly, his voice almost echoing through the halls and guards and even Garda himself seemed to hold their breath. Vithkun gave Myra a sidelong glance, a gaze almost asking if he had taken it too far. His father seemed to observe the situation and a few wrinkles appeared on his forehead. \"I see - so it was not to either provoke me nor showing her the honor of carrying it to its end destination, that you brought this common drow lady.\" Selathil's measured voice almost spoken as if he was chanting a spell between the words - his lips saying more than what was obvious. He started stepping down the low and wide steps from his throne and onto the general plateau Myra and Vith stood on as he flanked Myra on the opposite side of Vith turned towards her speaking to Vith. \"And what is your plan with all this - does she get to be a figurehead here in High Haven so you two can hold hands when we need the power of the Crimson Ascend?\" he asked Vithkun, who parted his lips but closed them again unable to answer in a way that did would not let all their concentrated schemes fall. Yet he did not hear what was spoken to Myra at that point - a clear projection of Selathil's voice into her head. \"So my gate guards were not wrong. Why have you come here, daughter of Beleon? I taught my son the magic that conceals your true identity - 'Karise'...\" his voice intimidating and authoritative. \"Such a trick is but a thin veil I can pull away whenever I like. What are your plans with my son and coming here with The Crimson Ascend? Is it revenge? Do you seek to challenge me with your foul magic here in the epicenter of light while drawing on the power of that amulet?

Vithkun had seen him like this before and he was getting ready to protect himself for whatever that may had lead to - but right there and then, from the corner of his eye, he saw Myra strolling over to Selathil and putting a hand on his arm. Choking a little as he tried to yell at her, no words came out. As Myra spoke to Selathil his orange gleaming eyes turned to the drow as he raised his other hand towards her. \"And I shall do that right now, if you cannot wait..!\" he said, Vithkun kicking and wriggling but to little avail as he saw his intent directed towards Myra. Yet at that point he realized that he had let Myra inside his mind before, that she had seen what even he was afraid to look upon - his own fears and self doubt. Selathil had delved into countless dimensions through his life and his mind had taken great strain from it and as such his life was - prematurely - coming to an end very soon. To see both his sons incapable of handling the transition to take over the throne had him greatly concerned and fear and guilt had been gnawing at him for a long time now. What would High Haven come to without heirs?Selathil released his powers directed at Myra as his face seemed overflowed with emotions. This drow had seen what he was afraid of, and now this connection - caused by one of his mental fractures inside his mind, due to his earlier undertakings - had allowed her a way into his mind. But not only had she done that, she was also presenting him with the truth of things - her own memories. Peering into a great sorcerer's mind was beyond dangerous, but even though he did not know what awaited his foolishness, he could not turn this offer down. Opening his inner eyes he rummaged through Myra's memories, not gently, but as one frantically trying to get all of the answers at once, turning pages of memories one immediately after the other he did not care about the psychic strain it would take upon the drow's mind. Much of this was news to Selathil, the abandoned drow city right inside High Haven was, something he had erased from his mind a long time ago - something extremely uncomfortable to him where he too had lost people he cared about. The holding spell, where Selathil had inscribed 'wooden branches' into the air with his thoughts only, ended abruptly and Vithkun dropped the five feet. Yet despite the sudden fall, he managed to take most of the grunt with his feet, yet ended up on his behind looking at Myra and his father - the young prince stunned by what happened. What he had no knowledge about was going on. \"I... had no idea...\" Selathil said to Myra as an answer to the many memories he had seen, acknowledging the truth of these along with the spell on her arm, that he knew was a truth-sealing spell. \"You fear for your people... as do I.\" he turned his head towards Vithkun, his head and spine now bent, as if he had largely given up. Selathil turns around and walks back a few paces before turning to Myra and Vithkun again. \"There are many things at play here, such will have to take a huge mental effort to...\" the elf king said, pride still covering his words, yet he was not allowed to finish his speech his lips moving but not a sound coming from his lips as everything inside the Thousand Lights Hall goes absolute dead quiet - even the breathing of oneself was not heard. Suddenly a tearing sound makes its presence heard, as if reality itself rips open and the elves are able to hear again, but the voice is one of such intensity that it is as if they haven't graced their ears with sound for years. \"Selathil you absolute fool!\" a sharp voice breaks through silence as the tearing sound stops, surely leaving the elves covering their ears. \"What is the whole idea of this theatrical performance from your side? Did you not use to bid welcome your guests in a gentle and friendly way?\" the voice continued, now way softer and warmer. \"Myerla dear...\" Selathil said and opened his eyes wide. \"You haven't been inside Thousand Lights Ha...\" his voice was cut off again as she made a gesture of closing her fingers. \"I haven't been here for a while, Selathil, but I also haven't had to cut your nonsensical drivel off for almost as long as I remember.\" her voice going slightly more firm again. \"Mother..!\" Vithkun exclaimed looking at the beautifully elegant elf, draped in green and gold robes, cupper blonde hair done into a large knot on the back of her head and standing on the middle of the bridge extending to the plateau in the middle. \"It's so good to see you again, my son!\" she said, her face almost exploding into a warm smile as she briskly strolls over to give Vithkun a large hug before looking at Myra. \"And you must be the drow that everyone has an opinion of.\" she said and looked up and down of Myra. \"Beautiful... And welcome to Excelmere! I look forward to forming my own opinion on you!\" she said and extended a hand to her. \"I am Myerla Almear, wife to Selathil - the king - and Vithkun is my son.\" she said and bowed a little to Myra with a wry smile.

He could have paused and allowed them to pass but he showed great strength and empathy in allowing himself to be overwhelmed by the spell itself to save those of the past. Whether he chose to punish her or not was of his own volition but facing his onslaught in the face of Vith being freed, which he was a moment later as he fell to the floor, was preferable. Unable to avert her gaze to him, to check on his fate, she knew much of what occurred he had no knowledge of. His brothers intentions were small in comparison to his father and when they were allowed to share what was necessary it would be without either hanging over their minds. As it were Selathil tore through hers, the intensity of his roving had never been felt and should she have been weaker in spirit he might have crippled her. Standing upright and keeping her arm upon his it took faith to show him these things and yet he yearned for more. To deny him was to suffer further consequence and yet she did clamping shut after the two she intended on showing him. Perhaps at another time he might feel the true weight of that which his son and her had fought and claimed together and that which she had suffered alone. He released her, and she lowered her hand keeping her posture erect if only for the sake of appearances, when he went to speak he was hushed but not by his own accord, but by the arrival of a woman who needed no introduction. Myra was about five feet from Vith as she had approached his father. They made an odd triangle in which his mother took center place. Myerla reamed Selathil up one side and down the other and had she the energy to have found it amusing she might have for it was familiar to her the same sort of words escaping her own mouth in an exasperated way she tore apart Vith. Relieved for her presence if only for the softening of her husbands' dramatics when she put forth her hand it was shocking, Myra had been introduced as lowly, if she had her own informants perhaps she also knew the truth. Refusing would be seen as impertinent if not rude to start thus she would reach over and take it lightly after bowing first, the same gesture as she gave Selathil before rising and speaking as clearly as she had before her exhaustion not to be taken into account for the brave face she put on when addressing her, \"Thank you,\" she said first and foremost of her compliment, \"It is a pleasure to meet you, your son speaks most highly of you.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Selathil's intent to infiltrate his sons mind might have destroyed it, the lack of trust expressed in the action was overwhelmingly clear but he believed it to be poisoned.

Since you appear to much smarter than the king..!\" he said sarcastically.\"I'd have you act like a king - that's what! And you haven't been taking rational decisions in a while now!\" she said, Selathil seemed taken aback by the non hesitating answer. \"I...\" he said trying to lift his chin to ascertain his pride, but his eyes locked with Myra's and then Vithkun's. He couldn't lie after what she had seen - and what he had seen himself and sighed deeply. \"I'm sorry my son, it was wrong of me to act like that... I'm happy to see you home.\" he said, a genuine, but slightly haunted smile, appeared before he looked at Myra. \"There's a deep purpose in your heart - I admit I felt afraid when feeling that.

Selathil looked at Vithkun, who understood little of what he meant by those last words, and nodded a couple of times. \"Perhaps I'd like to speak with you? It has been long time  since both of us have had a discussion up in The Spire.\" Selathil said to Vithkun. \"I... of course.\" Vithkun said, although these recent events were hard to just shrug off, he needed to talk to his father and straighten out a lot of things. \"Of course I'll join you but what of..?\" Vith said looking at Myra. \"I will take this young drow for a stroll and figure out the ins and outs. Perhaps then you two can 'settle the world' between you.\" she smirked and chuckled a bit gesticulating back towards the entrance. \"If you don't mind?\" she asked, her clear, blue eyes reaching into Myra's ever so inviting and gentle.

Myerla snapped her fingers and a quick clap of thunder created a small oasis a yards wide where no word would escape. \"Now we can speak. First of all, you have to tell me how you met?\" Myerla smirked looked at Myra. She was not just curious to how they met, but she did also know and care about people to a degree where the hunches she got was often correct.

Fleeting lives do the other races live, humans but a blink of our own and so easily exstinquished, dwarves tarry on for hundreds of years but it is but still a small time for us. Only Drow carry our longevity and yet it is not only distance that separates us now.\u201d\u00a0_______________________________Myerla seemed fond of the changes she saw within her son, changes that could not be explained easily nor in such a short explanation as she gave her second even worse for its openness. Vith had asked of her to keep their relationship a secret for a time and even if Myerla was overly observant she would not openly betray him. If she was pointing fingers and suggesting she would work about it best as she was able but there was only so much subterfuge she was comfortable and capable of. None of which she wanted to present for within this woman she saw warmth, motherliness, things that had been missed from her childhood and she so wished to warm to now. To cry on a shoulder of one understanding of their plight and of how it must look to others. Still her kindness could only extend so far and to openly accept the fact her son loved a Drow and she loved him was perhaps too far.\u00a0\u201cI will tell you nothing but the truth,\u201d she stated in earnest, \u201cBut in that I cannot tell you everything.\u201dMyerla spoke of a Drow then, one she was fond of, and noticed a resemblance. Myra found it unlikely that her relationship would have been formed with a commoner, for a queen would not have doted upon a peasant, especially one of an opposing race. Deducing rather quickly of who she spoke did not confirm or deny her suspicions but the ones clearly present upon the woman\u2019s face made her consider that there was much more to this story than she gave away at first for she had no given no name.\u201dDo you not speak to her now?\u201dTaking the fungi from the queen she held it delicately, considerately, she had seen common flowers here in her homeland as well but believed them to grow there for they extended across the landscape of the land and yet some were cultivated such as this. This was one she but rarely saw, and it was deep within the forest. Healers at times reappeared with it. She could not help but smile, small and sweet as she spoke of Myerla\u2019s son, \u201cVithkun carried with him a tea as well, a flower known to Azea but rare here he said,\u201d she looked to the woman still holding the distinct touch of home within her hand and one of the distinct differences between them within it, \u201cThough it had not the same harrowing effects on elven kind as this.\u201d", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Selathil like all elves was capable of deception, speaking in riddles and going about until one was confused as to what he truly spoke upon.

I will have to know the true story of High Haven or... I'll have to find it in another way - another place.\" Vithkun said, his threats not idle. Would Selathil care for what kind of version Vithkun was told?\"What is it exactly you believe separates us and drows?

It was not putting her down, rather pointing to this habit her friend had had too in only carving the truth out and leaving less vital details to the imagination. Yet of course Myerla did not know that Myra was bound to tell the truth by magic. Her face saddened a bit, and her pearly white complexion grew just slightly grey. \"She is not with us anymore, she passed when she gave birth to a daughter. She told me already before the birth, that this would be her last letter, and it was confirmed to me later that she had died. Somehow she knew what was going to happen - I still think of what have become of her child, as shortly after Azea underwent a change in leadership directly influencing her family's station.\" Myerla explained and gave a reluctant smile. \"But I'm going on for too long, am I not?\" she said apologetically. \"Ahhh yes, actually my friend told me of its purpose - she was very into alchemy of all sorts. Very useful - so useful actually that the elves here have taken credit for it already!\" she chuckled softly. \"No, it is quite benevolent when you don't take too much too often. Moon Rose Tea is apparently something drows and elves can share with equal pleasure.\" she explained, though there was definitely other uses for it as well, as her friend hadn't talked to her about. \"Now Karise...\" she turned towards the drow. \"What do you desire the most of all?\" she asked, such a blunt question would surely knock most elves off their feet.

As Vithkun heard the anger-lined words he narrowed his eyes. Selathil had always been prideful and he expected resistance, but had all this gotten worse since he left? As the thought went through Vithkun's head and answer was given and Vithkun did not have a chance to argue his before the table was abruptly flipped and a flurry of papers, documents and quills as he took a step back witnessing the growing madness of his father. \"Father, you let your emotions get the best of you.\" he said, his voice calm, though he started to feel inner turmoil. Could he even be reasoned with, had he come here in vain? \"I'll present a more measured answer for you, even if you do not care for reason right now.\" he said and took a deep breath. \"I've seen the depravity, and I've wept - and she wept.

Only a drow and an elf can wield it together, for it is meant to unite and not divide. If you have any trust in my ability, I'll ask you to show it.\" Vithkun said hoping to bridge some of the gap that had opened between them. __________________________________\"Ooh..? Is that some kind of drow magic? I haven't seen that before?\" Myerla spoke, having no direct knowledge about the seal that affected Karise, but she was quite aware that it was important in some way. Her question seemed to spark a myriad of answers pointing in vastly different directions, the emotions of this drow clearly spilling over the edge, and she suddenly felt a strange sense of care for the ashen elf. \"My dear...\" she said with a worried expression but a faint smile appearing shortly after she finished her long rant. \"Don't be nervous... Myralthrine...\" Myerla said stepping towards Karise, wrapping her arms around her in a warm, motherly hug. \"She told me your name in her last letter... If someone like my friend's daughter chose to care about my son, there is not much else I could ask for.\". Myerla was clearly much more frail than the toned and strong Myra, yet her body would embrace her with the ease of hot spring water and as she held Myra a soothing and varm voice would appear inside Myra's mind. The slightly more baritone voice revealed a self confident female drow voice - very much akin to the one she had heard when using Marchus' device. \"... I want her to be strong, I want her to live a life of purpose. I don't know what else I could feasibly hope for - Vith and Cass will content for the throne, from what you've told I believe High Haven is in the best of hands there, but after tomorrow Azea will change. I will call her Myralthrine, a name she shares with an ancestor, and a name I give her because I wish her to overcome. Her path won't be covered in rose petals and I can't imagine what hardships she'll face, but I'm sure she'll eventually find out who she is, and when that time comes, I hope she will rise and face the truth with no regrets. My only regret is not being able to give her a better start in life and a mother to care for her, but with this I hope to give her whatever she needs to forge her own path and become stronger and kinder than anyone before her. This is I said my last letter, you've been my friend for so long and if you ever cross paths with such a drow, I hope you'll recognize her. All the best to you and your sons and may the stars light your paths as I'm sure it will light Myralthrine's - or I will damn well make the gods turn their starlight on her myself. Yours, Yazale Beleon.\"The voice stopped in her head, the memory conveyed to her was not only the letter, but the letter such as her mother had spun the words in her head, spoken with all of the emotion and love to go with it that her mother felt for Myra at that time. Myra would hear a light sobbing from her shoulder, Myerla letting out a few tears after having shared this memory. \"She loved you so, and believed in you even if she never got to see you grow up...\" she squeezed Myra an extra time before slowly releasing her and stepping back. \"I... I eased your mind little too, it seemed like your thoughts from the last few days were in disarray...\" she sniveled a bit and a smile crept up her face. \"I'm glad I found you.\" a truly relieved smile appeared on Myerla looking at Myra almost in disbelief.

Then she relaxed, not often had it been she was openly shown affection and in those few short moments this woman had cut her open flaying her like one might with a dear exposing her deepest desires and her concerns and now she showed her such tender kindness that she could do nothing but embrace her in return. Her mothers voice flooded her and so did tears stream down her face.

There is a dressing room with facilities for cleaning on both sides, one for women and one for men - there will be an assortment of bathing clothes in there depending on what you prefer.\" Vithkun said and got up, taking a casual bite of an apple and smirked at Myra. \"See you in a bit...\" he said and disappeared into the dressing room on his side. It didn't take him long to pick the right clothes, a dark blue loin cloth of light yet sturdy quality that wouldn't hug the skin too tightly. Vithkun stepped out confident that he would be the first to step out. His scars were showing, and though they were no longer open, they were more pronounced than they had been through before his visit to the lost drow city. He stepped up to the spa and took a deep breath, the fresh air filling his nostrils and the view was pleasurable to say the least. Yet he could feel his scars again, it was as if something still worked to open them up and suddenly a voice in his mind called out to him. 'Vithkun, that's not the way. Turn around.' it whispered and Vithkun turned around in shock. It wasn't Myra, she was still to exit the dressing room. Vithkun felt a faint breeze coming from the large round elven carving on the rock wall - a carving he had noticed when he was younger, but was never explained. The symbols for fire, water and growth was there and yet... Those were not just put there random and he felt a strange pull towards although the voice was no longer present.

To her knowledge elves were modest but there was hardly anything that met that description in the places she looked. Finally settling upon something it was much less revealing than when they had dived back into the warm water in the caves. It was but a short time ago and yet it felt like so long since they had entered the borders of the elven kingdom. Raising up the fabric it had been treated to dry quickly and was smooth as butter against her skin. It was silver, a color that would not suit most of the elves that came here. A one piece it had a full bottom but a sharp v that came down between her breasts just beneath them. It wrapped around the sides and then dipped in the back as well. Brushing out her hair with her fingers until she found a brush there meant for the purpose she would grab a towel before heading out to the main area. Barefoot now Vithkun would get a proper look at the length of her legs, the sturdiness of her form in decent light, and the falsehood of raven hair upon her skin. Pausing as she exited to take in the view it was truly breathtaking, but another had her eyes a moment later as she walked about to the steps.

However something didn't feel right and he was unable to fully enjoy it, an anxiety settling within his body as his eyes kept darting towards the mural. What was the voice he had heard, and what was the thing about it? The signs were odd, it was if they were all connected so you could... \"Trace them with your finger!\" Vithkun suddenly exclaimed and and looked Myra in the eyes with an intense gaze and hurried up to the large mural, starting to trace the lines as a golden spark followed in its wake. \"There!\" he said and took a step back, as suddenly it lit up and the solid rock turned to a growth of vines, that turned to a burning inferno in the next moment before in the end water enveloped the fire and turned to mist in the heat, leaving only a seven feet tall circular opening that lead into the bedrock. He turned towards Myra as he felt the breeze on his skin, like the calm breathing of someone expecting him. \"This must seem very wrong considering I promised something comfortable - but I believe there is something or someone down here calling out to me.\" he said reluctantly and gave a smirk. \"I think this tunnel is leading into the heart of the healing springs, that provides Li Edhile with its water.\" Vithkun fully turned to Myra, something drawing him to walk this path, yet scaring him senseless. \"Can I ask you to follow me?

He hadn't expected her to be so willing to do it, at least they could have done it together or something. She didn't even know if there was something dangerous at the bottom - but then again why would there be? This was a land of healing, a pit of spikes was not a common elven contraption at the end of a water slide. As Myra flew down the slide she would have to pass several sharp twists and turns - some so sharply bent that she would ride on the side of the tube. Eventually though she would pass a turn slide into a small pool of water designed to stop the forwards movement. The slide was quite long and even yelling into the tube, Vithkun would only hear her words very faintly. He sighed deeply sat down on the edge of the tube and crossed his arms in front of him - he hesitated slightly yet some sort of silent calling hit his mind once again and he closed his eyes and slid into the unknown. A series of bumps and sudden bends later Vithkun was chaotically launched into the pool at the bottom, only head first and stomach down as he had been thrown around inside the tube. Popping his head up from the pool Vithkun brushed his soaked hair away from his face. \"That was downright horrible! How in the world did you enjoy that hell ride?\" he asked though he couldn't help but chuckle a little too. \"Where are we though?\" he said and looked around, as he pulled himself from the pool and up onto the grassy ground around them. \"Grass?\" he exclaimed though his surprise would not seize there as they had arrived inside a huge cave, little white glowing crystal placed all around the dome and on the ground. It complimented the flowers, vine and bushes that grew even on the roof. Vithkun bend down and placed his palm beneath a leaf. \"This is extraordinary, I've never seen this. There are tiny crystals growing from petals too..!\" he said amazed and looked up. \"Could we be directly beneath the Thousand Lights Hall?\" he popped the question to himself. As they looked around they would both however see a large lake with calm waters and a small grassy island in the middle around two hundred feet out. It was hard to see, but there was a small tree and a piedestal with what looked to be an old book placed on it. \"That book...\" Vithkun said and narrowed his eyes. \"I feel like it's important, that it can tell me something I need.\" he turned to Myra, his expression both worried and determined. \"I'm heading out there.\" he said and started dipping his feet in the water, which quickly became much deeper and would reach his chest. However the further he went out into the lake, the warmer the water got and already a few steps out, the water was almost too hot to proceed longer, Vith feeling his scars throbbing groaning from the lack of ability to go any further.
