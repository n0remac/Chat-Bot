New buildings are raised and demolished on a daily basis, the dwarves constantly finding new ways to improve them, with new techniques or new magics, new tools or new ideas. They are highly prosperous, their city nestled between a large river and a mountain. Mines and farms dot the landscapes around the city, each with a different purpose, as efficient as the dwarves can make them. Heavily-armored dwarves patrol the streets of both the city and the outlying areas, quick to put down any sort of trouble that would impede the city.\u00a0Thanks to its sturdy construction, the city escaped the ravages of the Cataclysm, emerging relatively unscathed, the industrious dwarves quick to repair the damage. In spite of their focus on efficiency, the dwarves are a cheerful lot, happy to talk to, or even better explain things to, travelers and the like who pass through their lands. The occasional giant can also be seen, for they inhabit the mountain and have a strong alliance with the dwarves. The dwarves are ruled by the Council of Crafts, comprising of the premier crafts (stonework, woodwork, metalwork, brewing) as well as others (Master of the Guard, Master of the Gold, and Master of the Farm), who rule in democratic fashion to ensure the city is in the best position possible.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://imgur.com/glTm9Vn.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://imgur.com/glTm9Vn.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}, "post-66777": {"user": "Grandma", "user_num": 602, "timestamp": "1494964069000", "message": "A rather gruff looking donkey approached the gates of Khaldaruhm, Grandma sitting on its back.

In some way their skills were admirable but on the other hand it was far from having any commendable aesthetic value Cec\u00e9lia thought. As she slowly approached the city on her lean and athletic brown Rond\u00f3n horse a small escadr\u00f3n of seven skilled horsemen followed in her tracks. Cec\u00e9lia wondered how to put it in a nice way. Normally it was nothing less than a general or the likes of rank who came to visit when picking out a potential weapons partner but the fact that the dwarven city was so far from Rond\u00f3n and the comfort and shade of the officers' casas meant that Cec\u00e9lia as young commandante had been picked for the job. Not that she doubted she was probably far more skilled for the job than most of her higher ranked brethren who used a butter knife more often than their sabre, but it just so happened that some people wanted the jirafa instead of the caballo despite the latter being the most useful.Approaching the city gate Cec\u00e9lia quite nimbly - considering wearing her armor - jumped off her horse and with her usual straightened back and dignified attitude she approached the guards. \"I am commandante Cec\u00e9lia de Amar of The Kingdom of Rond\u00f3n, sent by her majesty Queen Xiomara de Rond\u00f3n to discuss trade with your kin.\" Cec\u00e9lia stated bluntly, though she considered her direct approach with people she didn't know a courtesy on her behalf.
