Skeletons lay strewn about, splintered and crushed, covered in centuries of dust and wearing chain and gambesons, flying colors of an unknown country, lost to time.\u00a0The walls, despite their age, still stand, crumbled only in a few places due to the lack of upkeep. A few siege engines set atop the curtain wall, bearing threateningly down upon the surrounding forest, but age has rotted away wood and ropes and most are empty of any ammunition. Rats and massive spiders skitter about the fallen stones and fallen men, paying them no heed.\u00a0It seemed Fort Justice may pass into obscurity, lost to time and eventually reclaimed by the earth. That was, until Vash the Black. Flush with victory and a dragon's gold, the demon-bastard gnoll had joined a quest with two other mercenaries to investigate the place. As soon as he laid eyes upon it, however, he decided one simple fact: He wanted it. Two mercenaries don't put up much of a fight, particularly when they don't know one is coming.\u00a0Since then the gnoll has moved in a small retinue of hobgoblins whom he had convinced to follow through coercion and violence. Only about twenty in number, he has since had them find and corral the spiders of the surrounding forests, which they have spent their entire lives training before his arrival. Now the gnoll sits within a stone fortress, utilizing his new title Vash the Black and preparing to once-more strike fear into human hearts.\u00a0Defenses: Twenty Moderately armed and armored hobgoblins. With mottled greenish-gray skin and standing, generally, at about five feet tall. They are equipped with falchions, spears and bows.\u00a0Twenty well-trained giant spiders, each about the size of a large dog. They are deadly quick and have black, chitinous bodies. They apply constant traps of webbing and patrol the forest within a mile of the wall. They sense vibrations, through the ground to a degree, but primarily through their webbing. Only those marked with a pheromone specially crafted by the hobgoblins will not be attacked. Their venom is terribly potent, and can bring down a horse or deer in a matter of hours.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Deep in the woods far from civilization and surrounded by thick, inhospitable woods a squat, unimpressive fort stakes its claim.

It had been centuries since they had been maintained and as such following them was difficult and walking upon them even more so with uneven flagstones and massive roots. Vash slowed here, partially to pick over the road with ease, Khepri  tucked under his arm like a barrel and partially to keep an eye and an ear out for more danger. The woods were hardly kind, even to one who lived within them. They traveled this way for several hours until the trees around them seemed to be wreathed in white shrouds of silk. All around them the scuttling of many legs tossed leaves and sticks aside in the shadows. Large, soulless black eyes could, on occasion, be seen peering, light glinting off them in the dim light that filtered through the thick canopy.  Despite their hungry, terrible gaze, however, they made no move to approach. These weren't merely wild creatures, but tamed. The gnoll's unsettling guardians. At last they came to a number of felled tree trunks and, above them, the towering walls of Fort Justice. It had no towers, or special features, but instead was dull and ugly. The trees for a short distance had been hacked down in the perimeter, to prevent anyone from using the cover of the trees to merely stroll up to the walls proper. Heading through the large wooden gate as the signal was struck and the doors swung open several hobgoblins bowed as Vash entered the courtyard with his price and the whooped and cheered at the sight. \"I have special plans for you, pet.\" he growled at Khepri. \"Listen up, men! She starts singing or a-whistlin' you let me know! I'll cut her filthy tongue out myself!\" he declared to which the hobgoblins cheered in unison. Then, sweeping into the main fort as they opened the doors for her, she would see that not much had been done with it. Skeletons still lay about and dust covered most surfaces. Barrels and crates were clear of dust, having been recent additions to their larders and many still bore the symbol of Isra. In this main chamber, a large chair had been places. Far from a throne, but its majesty was quite unlike the rotted, rickety things that lie around. Heading down an adjoining hallway he made a few turns until he came to a door towards the inner part of the fort, well away from the outer walls which may be penetrated and, most importantly in Khepri's case, where light could come in. No, it seemed Fort Justice may very well have held prisoners in its past as the seemingly VIP cell had no windows and was left in complete darkness. A mattress, rotted into nothing and filling the small, unventilated chamber with a powerful smell of mold that seemed to cling to every surfaces. There were no lights or candles, even chairs and tables were reduced to tinder. Snapping at a nearby Hobgoblin the small thing, referred to as Ro\u1e31 began scooping out the remains of these pitiful sights, leaving a bare room which another hob brought in armfuls of rough leaves, spreading them across the floor in a makeshift bed even a dog might turn its nose up at. They had no horses, after all, and certainly no hay which might have made a comfortable place to lay. \"Like your chambers your Majesty?\" the gnoll asked, motioning to the terrible living quarters.
