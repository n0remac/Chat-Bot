Otherworldly rays of resplendent\u00a0light shine down through the trees, and the creatures who live there are without fear or predator.\u00a0Yet... There is something strange about them. A feeling of unease in the air, as though magic pervades it and casts a beautiful illusion over the eyes of mortals. Those who try to explore them only ever seem to end up back at the edge, no matter what direction they are convinced they travelled in, or what tools they used to make certain. It is possible to pass from one end of the forest to the other, but only if it is one's intention to do so - and during the journey no part of the forest looks any different from another.A river is known to run through Ellethamar, but there are no known maps that show it or any other features than expanse of the woodlands themselves. They are surrounded heavily by mountain ranges, which make up a large portion of the western, south-eastern, eastern and north-eastern borders of the woods. Though many choose to avoid venturing into Ellethamar, it is one of the only gaps that allow passage from the north side of the mountains to the south.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/Gp1fjSp.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Gp1fjSp.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}}
