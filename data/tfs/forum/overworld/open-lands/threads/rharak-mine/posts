It\u2019s a bit more like a hastily erected slum built around a massive mine than any real town or village. The living is harsh, farming is impossible, owing to its location. People here are, by and large, poor, but they\u2019re looking to change that. Because this settlement is right on top of what\u2019s said to be one of the largest mithril deposits in the Overworld. How it was discovered is anyone\u2019s guess, but word has gotten out, and the miners have arrived, flocking in from all corners of the world, looking to make their fortune in the mines. Due to the circumstances, refining the ore here is impractical -- laughably so. Instead, crates of ore are sold; 50 gold for a crate of 50 lbs of Mythril Ore -- as many as you can carry. A steal. Aside from the fact that at that point, you\u2019re up in the frozen reaches of the north with crates full of rocks. To turn a profit, one would need to find a buyer for the ore, and the goats around here don\u2019t seem very much interested. [This is a neutral location. One can come here to purchase ore and sell food, but there will not be a response posted by the setting, as it is unowned. Make your RP.] ", "link_list": ["https://000fesbra000.deviantart.com/art/Factory-645701777"], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/cYNviIf.jpg"], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://000fesbra000.deviantart.com/art/Factory-645701777\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Factory by 000Fesbra000\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/cYNviIf.jpg\" style=\"max-width:50%;\"/></a></div>"}}
