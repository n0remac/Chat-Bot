Its tulips filled the air with an intoxicating scent, and the soft drone of bumblebees mingled with the pleasantries of a well-fed and happy people going about their daily duties. Pastries lined the sills of windows, their scent wafting over the passer-by, even as they competed against the fragrance of a sea of flowers. The air was charged with the hope and prosperity of people who had carved out their little niche in the world and were all the happier for it. Had the people realized that such beauty would be the last they saw of their beloved homes they would no doubt have given it the appreciation it deserved. Or, more wisely, they would have considered keeping better watch. As a sky of warm pastels faded to its customary darkness, the people tucked themselves away. Off in the distance, however, something was approaching like a sea of mottled green and sleek black. Scuttling, spindly legs brushed through the tulips as if they weren't there, though the people would not be so lucky. Hideous spiders, each the size of a man with some reaching near the size of horses approached the city with barely a sound. The vanguard of a horrific attack. The night watch barely had time to cry out before the beasts were upon them, burying dagger-like fangs into their flesh and injecting a paralytic venom. There and then they began their evil work, spinnerets working as they cocooned their victims into convenient bundles and discarded them on the streets, setting out for new prey. Behind them, were their only slightly-more-intelligent masters. Hobgoblins marched over the flowers, trampling them in their wake. Hefting cruel falchions they descended onto the town, just as the first screams of terror broke through the formerly peaceful air. Men ran from their homes, armed with whatever they could find. Rusty swords and well-worn pitchforks did little, however, to armed and armored enemies. A brave man charged one of the spiders, the pitchfork sticking home as he drove it into a nearby wall, trying to pin the struggling beast to some effect until a hobgoblin from behind beheaded him with a wicked blow. Women and children had little time to escape, bludgeons and captured in nets or by the shackled of hobgoblins or, of they were less fortunate, making it far enough from the city that more ravenous spiders ran them down like oversized, impossibly terrifying dogs, bounding well over twenty feet to capture and pin them. The pleasant fragrances that had once dominated the pleasant village was now tainted by the coppery smell of blood and viscera. Hobgoblins smashed in doors, looting through valuables and grabbing up any humans that thought they may be able to hide away. Their keen scent let few escape. Even these creatures weren't the most terrible thing to descend on this sleepy little town, however. There among the green men, towered a single, brutish creature, face clad in black metal that glinted in the moonlight. Vash the Black surveyed the town with relish, even getting the chance to crush the skull of one would-be hero that had managed to dig up his father's old sword. This was what he loved. He didn't really have to work. Not on a town this ridiculously unprotected. He'd half expected there to be some sort of terrible wizard or yet another dragon that would defend it. (A large reason he had waited so long to make his appearance)But these were merely humans. Soft, weak, and fat on prosperity. It only took half the night to complete the raid, with only two casualties. Admittedly, those had both been from overzealous spiders attacking their own men, but you had to break a few skulls to make a skull throne. As shackled or webbed humans were hauled away in wagons, or in marching lines flanked by their captors, and bundles and chests were filled to the brim with loot to be hauled away Vash admired the extent of the damage dealt. Even corpses were brought along. You could never have too many rations, after all. The town, broken and ransacked stood like a skeletal effigy of the life and vibrance it had once had. Then, whirling Meteor it burst into flame and at last, with a sweeping blow a rolling wheel of black fire impacted a nearby building, causing it to burst into flames. The Gnoll turned, padding away after his men as the ghost town of Hollin burned with demonic fire.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "It had, as always, been a pleasant day in Hollin.
