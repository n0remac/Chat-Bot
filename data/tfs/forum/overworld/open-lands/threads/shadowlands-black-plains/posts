It is deathly quiet, and void of life. The only reprieve from the silence is the blowing of a chilly wind that stirs the black grasses, or the occasional sounds of distant thunder. Upon these dark plains, the sun never shines, blotted out by dark clouds above. A somber light emanating from within the clouds that shifts from blue to violet depending on the time is the only source of illumination across the dark fields.", "link_list": ["https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEGu9fvfqkU"], "image_list": [], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEGu9fvfqkU\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Background Music</a><br><br/></br></div>"}, "post-89209": {"user": "Grandma", "user_num": 602, "timestamp": "1550200003000", "message": "A thin line of light appears, a stark contrast to the dark plains that stretch as far as the eye can see. The thin line slowly widens, revealing something more than just a bright light. Rows of soldiers clad in Isran armor. There is a brief moment of stillness as the portal expands to its full size, wide enough for eight soldiers to stand abreast of each other. Collectively letting out a breath they perhaps hadn\u2019t known they\u2019d been holding, the first eight soldiers began marching forward.The first to exit the portal was a combination of swordsman and spearmen, alternating each row of eight. Following them came the archers which were then followed by the mages. And a great many mages it was. In almost all conventional armies, mages were outnumbered by their non-magical brethren many times over, but that was not the case here. There were one hundred swordsman, one hundred spearmen, fifty hundred archers, and one hundred and fifty mages. Finally, a handful of members for the exploration corps along with Grandma herself were the last to exit the portal. As was according to their plan, the soldiers were already beginning to set up a temporary camp here, setting up their tents and preparing fire pits. Bringing in the soldiers without first exploring the area personally was a bit of a gamble, but Grandma had a feeling a larger group such as this would cause this land to reveal its secrets in a much more timely manner than it would if she simply poked around on her own.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "A thin line of light appears, a stark contrast to the dark plains that stretch as far as the eye can see.

Nonetheless, they continued setting up camp, stiffly going through the motions in spite of the many misgivings they were beginning to have. Perhaps as just a few of them were finally beginning to grow used to their new environment, the smell of rotting flesh wafted its way into the camp. More than a few of the soldiers lost their lunch, while others with a bit stronger stomachs simply grimaced at the stench and carried on with their duties. Grandma stood a few hundred feet away from the camp that was currently being set up, flanked on either side by a pair of mages and four guards from the Inquisition. Using this many Isran soldiers as a bait of sorts was a rather loathsome thing to do, but what the more morally scrupulous in Isra didn\u2019t know couldn\u2019t hurt them. That was more than she could say for the soldiers she had brought. While she had no intention of leaving them to the devices of this godforsaken land without offering a helping hand this was a mission that was likely to require a few necessary sacrifices. Wrapping her robe more tightly around herself in response to the uncomfortable chill of the wind, Grandma began slowly shuffling her way towards the camp.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "There was obvious unrest among the company of Isran's, the soldiers especially.
