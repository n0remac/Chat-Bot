It is a lavish, multi-leveled establishment with a restaurant on the ground floor. Sitting at the end, next to the stairs, is a massive fish tank that rises up all the way to the ceiling. Filled with various sea life, it has also known to feature gorgeous merfolk with intoxicating voices, along with other mysteries of the vast oceans.On the second floor sits two other extensions of the Tooth and Tongue: a cafe to the left built with warm overtones and a gorgeous view of the Fine Eye's protective dome, and to the right, a bar built around a lantern tree that bears glowing fruit, mimicking a night sky and giving off a solemn after dark mood.The menu is vast and the cooks proficient. Rare and exotic meats can be found here, and if it isn't written down, the staff is happy to help you get exactly what you need for a pretty penny.", "link_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/DoSGfQT.png", "https://i.imgur.com/9Q53tgK.png"], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/jiRaE6W.png"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><font face=\"times new roman\" size=\"5\"><b>Tooth and Tongue</b></font>\u00a0</div>"}, "post-94904": {"user": "Maribel Correa", "user_num": 3269, "timestamp": "1580071657000", "message": "As soon as the two vampiresses and their esteemed company made it to Tooth and Tongue, a hostess showed them to a table with swift grace.

So many rumors of them attaching to the bottom of ships and eating any poor drunkard that falls overboard makes me wonder. It's certainly intelligent. A servant came over, presenting three bottles of wine. One was Gauldish by the name of Sang d'homme, another was an Isran special mixed with two other reds, and the third was from a country that recently emerged from the mists- Toragana- made with spices from nomads who had lost their city decades ago.\"An interesting selection.

Intelligent indeed...\" He echoed before looking at the waiter that came and presented the assortment of wines.

I'd prefer something more full-bodied and dry.\" He told the waiter as he crossed a leg over his knee. \"I have not had the luxury to travel to the country of Toragana as of yet. I'd like to soon make my appearance there.
