The Kingdom is renowned internationally for it's chocolates and candies along with tinker-works such as watches accurate to the nanosecond. The country also\u00a0 has a wonderful seaside, albeit frozen still at the moment. Some people also go out to the fields where there is an almost and perhaps truly magical bloom of poppies every year. Though the country has currently no King and is being ruled by a combination of parliament, mayoral authority and a regency council, it is nevertheless open to visitors. Of note to them is the upcoming festival of St. Emil, the festival of sweets and love commemorating the millennia old protest against a dark Emperor. Though the state advertises for a visit to the city, much of the real fun can be had in the snowy villages about with their ancient traditions passed down by elders.
