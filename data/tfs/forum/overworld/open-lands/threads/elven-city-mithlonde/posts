The city, once prosperous, was the seat of a massive empire, laid to waste by the Cataclysm, and hordes of enemies that took advantage of the weakness of the Elves. The remaining Elves are a dour lot, angry at the hand that fate dealt them and determined to survive by almost any means necessary.\u00a0Mithlonde sits above a great chasm, opened by the cataclysm that swallowed half the city, including the massive noble houses that once ruled over their Empire. The rest of the city was secured to the rock face, by ancient magics that have to be renewed once every ten years. The gates and exterior portion of the city defenses look out over the land approaches to the City, guarded by the vigilant Elven Warriors and Rangers.The city itself still shows the magnificence of a bygone age, with great spires atop massive, elegantly constructed towers. Everything is constructed to a geometric precision that many modern architect-mages would struggle to match, but the secret of their construction is long gone. Parts of the city are fallen into disrepair, having been destroyed in sieges or lost to the ravages of time, the remaining Elves doing all they can to stop further decay, reconstruction of anything non-critical almost impossible. The outskirts of the city feature many of these ruins, the only real life here found amongst the Elven Guards who patrol the walls and gates of the City. In the interior of the city, life continues to the best that it can. Taverns and Inns are prominent, as are training fields, for all of the Elves are required to serve in times of dire need. Great murals are painted along the streets, and the farms that support the city are located beneath the ground, ancient magics providing the crops with all they need to survive. Attacks on the city or its patrols are almost weekly in occurrence and some new threat rears its head almost annually. Getting to the city is difficult enough, for the guard patrols do not range as far as they used to, and the trails have fallen into disrepair, plagued by bandits and orcs, or other such creatures.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://imgur.com/NZOyQgw.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://imgur.com/NZOyQgw.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}, "post-66349": {"user": null, "user_num": null, "timestamp": "1494606826000", "message": "Along the once-great roads walked a lone figure- a human woman of fairly short stature wearing a red tunic and matching cloak to cover her face.
