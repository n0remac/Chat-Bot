Even so, you cannot mould it into metal or equipment with basic forges, so ensure that you have a forge available that can make lava feel like ice by comparison! Forging without kordanite tools such as hammers will be difficult, so you must anneal it first - heat it as high as it can go, then let it slowly cool down by itself.
