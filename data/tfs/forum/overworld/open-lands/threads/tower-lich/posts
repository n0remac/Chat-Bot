Nothing grows there, the ground is barren and dead, and evil magic fills the air. In the middle of the clearing is a dark, dirtied Tower, surrounded by pillars with strange menacing crystals on top. There are no windows, the only visible way in or out is a solid metal door on the western side of the tower. It is also warded against any uninvited magical means of entering.Inside the Tower isn\u2019t any more pleasant, plagued by cobwebs and strange creatures willing to devour any unwitting intruder. However they know well enough to stay out of the way of the Tower\u2019s owner, and the Lab, Armory, and the Study is relatively clean and tidy.The Tower has a few main locations:- Outside: Anything in the clearing outside the tower- Hallways: Anything inside the tower not in a specific location- Lab: Where Krahtos make his creatures and artifacts- Armory: Where Krahtos stores his creatures and artifacts- Study: Where Krahtos spends most of his time outside of his lab", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Deep in the forest there is a large clearing, reeking with decay and death.
