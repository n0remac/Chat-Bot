It's clear to any visitors that it was once at the very height of luxury, but has since fallen on hard times. It's inhabited solely by the aged Lord Waltz and a skeleton crew of maids and servants. Lord Waltz, it's said, was once the lord of the entire area. Those times are long past, though. He grew old, and his children rejected the noble lifestyle and left him. Nobody knows why they left, but they've never returned. Distraught by the loss of his children, Lord Waltz's health failed and his estate went into decline. Nowadays, he's bedridden, only kept alive by the continued efforts of his loyal staff. There's considerable debate as to who the castle will go to when he dies, but there are rumors that he has a grandson somewhere. Nobody knows who this boy is, though, as Lord Waltz keeps his will safe under lock and key.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/s2fwqDt.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/s2fwqDt.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}, "post-67251": {"user": "Sasha Pierce", "user_num": 2292, "timestamp": "1495220242000", "message": "Sasha road the distance toward the castle.

It was warm, after all. Even though it felt a little wrong to be taking a lady's coat, it was probably better than letting his illness worsen in the cold.\"Thank you, Miss. You're very kind. \"When she offered to find his heir, he paused. Could he really trust this woman? She'd admitted that she lied to get in here, after all. Still, there was something honest about her. Perhaps she just had a trustworthy face, but something about her made Lord Waltz want to trust her, to believe her. After all, she was the only one who'd actually offered to help find his heir, rather than try to pretend to be a distant relative.\"Could you really do that, miss? Could you find him? How...how can I know that you won't harm him? After I'm gone, there will be many people after him, trying to get rid of him before he can claim the castle. Could you keep him safe and bring him here? I wonder if he'll even believe that he's the grandson of a lord...last I heard, his parents died in an alchemy accident and he was sent to live with his father's family. Poor boy. I wonder what ever became of him, how he turned out. Perhaps he's a great warrior, or a courageous adventurer. I'd bet so. He's a member of the Waltz family, after all.
