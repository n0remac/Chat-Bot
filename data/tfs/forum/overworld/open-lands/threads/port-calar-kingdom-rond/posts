She was over the side in an instant, sprinting up the beach as she led the charge towards the Zephyr defenses. There was something about this that just felt right, leaping off a ship with axe in hand to raid a seaside city. It reminded her of her mother, and of her childhood home. How many times had she heard stories of her grandparents' days as raiders, or seen her mother's friends drinking and carousing as they got their wounds from the latest excursion stitched up.

He was also an excellent business man, with the skills to go with it -- but that was where his true excellence ended.A few of his ships had broken through the naval blockade, pointedly the ones with Roxanne Fletcher upon them. This was, perhaps, specific. He did not like the woman, and the sooner he sent her into the thick of things, the sooner she might find herself impaled on the end of a Zephyy pike. Little did he know, however, that his daughter, @mireia was upon Roxanne's ship, doing exactly what Lord Cordoba did not want her to do--Fighting the Rondi tooth and nail, and idolizing Dame Roxanne Fletcher as she smashed the enemy.Miraculously, three ships managed to land upon the beach outside of Port Calar -- the walled port itself was brimming to full with hostile naval ships that were suddenly engaged by the City of Khaldaruhm dwarves that had drifted out of the mists like demons from hell.A palisade of criss-crossed wooden pikes marked the beaches of Port Calar, and when Roxanne crossed the line, a magical leyline burst from the wooden pikes, making their pointed slivers explode like crossbow bolts into the line of following Rondi men.Screams of their anguish filled the air, but the trick was only good once, and as other ships landed behind them, more Rondi rushed to join Roxanne. The defense of the walls around Port Calar was a heavy one, and the gate was thick wood, clearly enchanted from strikes from an axe -- the Rondi men would need a battering ram.They had one... but every man that went to lift it was picked off by the Zephyy archers and boltmen standing on Port Calar's wall. Fire and smoke was thick in the air, the darkness of the storm making the battles glow...... in fact, it was almost beautiful to watch it all, the ships out on the dark and twisting sea like glittering stars that were exploding into each other.For the Dwarves of the City of Khaldaruhm, however, it was probably less than beautiful and yet, still glorious. Zephyy and Rondi men were just not as hardy as dwarves, their ships made of a finer wood, and considering they had never gone against these dwarves before, they weren't sure how to handle the unique make of their ships.The dwarven ships pierces like lances into their sides, and the wood of their ships was so sturdy that it burned slower than the other ships that were there. The shorter height of the dwarves worked to their advantage as well, as small as grown children, but as thick and ferocious as mountain boars.The force was so terrifying for the flank of the Zephyy naval blockade -- primarily made up of stalwart merchants -- that they began to run, drifting even further South away from the combat -- and leaving the way open for those hardy, stubborn, defiant dwarven ships to pierce right into the walled harbor...", "link_list": ["/user/472", "/user/2273", "/user/2273"], "image_list": [], "html": "<i>Years</i>"}, "post-79192": {"user": "Roxanne Fletcher", "user_num": 472, "timestamp": "1517593386000", "message": "There was no way for the Rondi troops to get a battering ram across these blood-soaked sands, that much was clear.

I need the Tibur\u00f3n run aground at full magical power, forced up over the sand. We're going to use it as a battering ram to crush the gates, so we're going to need a whole lot of speed.

As long as it got them through the gates, the lord's irritation was just a bonus. Glancing back, she saw the Rondi ships beginning to clear a path, and a faint red glow begin to form around the chosen vessel. The sea around it began to steam and boil as the mages gathered their energy and focused it on the ship, and a soft hum slowly became audible. The ship began to move slowly, then picked up speed and power as it hurdled through the sea. It cut through the waves and surf easily, spray kicking up over the bow as it flew up towards the beach. Rondi and Zephyy soldiers alike dove out of its way as it ran aground, crushing any too slow or unfortunate to be caught under its bulk. Roxanne felt a brief pang of regret as she saw men too injured to move being killed by the ship, but it was a necessary sacrifice. She ran towards the Tibur\u00f3n as it hurdled across the beach, jumping up and grabbing onto a rope on the side.

Crashing through the gate had been interesting to say the least, and although the Zephyy did not have the naval prowess that the Rondi and the City of Khaldaruhm seemed to have, they were fierce in their land combat, and had many numbers lying in wait.Roxanne Fletcher, @mireia and @eric would find themselves quickly and easily surrounded by the chaos of the Zephyy as they came into Port Calar, and with the crowded fighting in the streets, it easily became confusing. So many bodies packed together -- they were like sardines, and snipers in the taller buildings and upon the walls were picking off people easily. It at once became so chaotic that it no longer mattered where they aimed. Men were dying left and right, and fires were started to add to the over all panic of the fight.Once the Dwarven fleet hit into the harbor itself, they'd find themselves on more of an even keel, so to speak. The Zephyy were fierce fighters and warriors, and without the churning waves of the bay to throw them off, they were much more grounded in their attacks on the dwarven fleet.

However, the bloodshed and sheer brutality surprised even her. The beach had been child's play to this slaughterhouse, where troops on both sides fell in droves. Running through the streets, she saw exactly how quickly the city's defenses had been built. Signs of everyday life could still be seen all around the city, with hastily boarded-up shops and abandoned food stands. An arrow thudded into the wall beside her head, and she ducked down and ran into the melee. She was a sitting duck out here, she needed something to give her an edge. All of a sudden, she heard the thunder of hooves and iron on cobblestones behind her. Glancing back, she saw a Zephyy horseman, riding through the crowd and laying waste with a saber. Perfect. Ducking back into an alley until the rider got close, she lunged forward as she heard the sickening slice of the saber cleaving through flesh. She jumped up onto what looked like an empty bread seller's stand, using the extra height to launch herself into the man from the left right as he rode by at full gallop. He didn't have so much as a moment to turn and bring his blade around before her momentum took them both off the horse and to the ground. The man took the brunt of the impact for the both of them, mostly on his back and head. Roxanne leaped up in an instant, stepping up into the warhorse's stirrups and swinging up onto the now-empty saddle. She jerked on the reins, and the horse reared up and turned. Giving the reins a sharp snap, she coaxed the horse into a gallop, its iron-clad hooves striking sparks on the cobblestones.The call from reinforcements came from the southern section of the city. A battalion of veteran Zephyy soldiers had managed to barricade off a plaza, keeping the Rondi forces at bay with arrows and magical attacks. It seemed to be a stalemate at the moment...but it tied up Rondi troops who could be sorely needed elsewhere. As the two sides exchanged fire, it seemed that they'd be there all day...Until Roxanne rode up a side street at full gallop, having cut her way through the defenders on that side. As she neared the barricade, she urged her horse forward faster, pushing it to its limit as it sprinted towards the abandoned flower cart that served as a roadblock. Just when it seemed that she'd run into it, she jerked up on the reins, and the horse jumped, soaring into the air. Its back hooves caught the top edge of the cart, crashing right through the flimsy wood and sending an explosion of roses flying into the street. As soon as its hooves were on the ground, it took off running once more. Roxanne wasted no time, ducking low to avoid arrows and swinging her axe into any heads unfortunate enough to be within reach. It was a far cry from the clean, sophisticated cavalry saber that the horse's previous owner had been using, but it was more than effective (if a bit messy). The distraction and chaos behind the line was enough to draw the defenders' attention away from the Rondi troops at their front, and the stalemate was broken. As Roxanne rode back and forth through the square, the Rondi troops advanced, emboldened by their foreign commander's bravery and heroic feats. The position was overrun and secured within an hour, and Roxanne dismounted to take a much-needed breather and find some water. Around the city, the fires still raged and the cacophony of combat rang out. It would be quite a bit of work before the city was finally taken, but Roxanne was confident that Port Calar would fly a Rondi flag before the sun sank below the horizon.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Roxanne had expected the fighting in the streets to be harsh and chaotic, as the Zephyy were defending their home city.

The grip on her sword was slick with the red liquid, but she could barely feel it.Bodies around her were going slack from arrows shot into the crowd from above as thy tried to get down the street. Mireia's head looked up, and she saw that Zephyy snipers had taken position in a belltower.Smaller than the other men, and not as heavily armored, she squeeeezed out from the fray, breathing hard and trying not to panic. She saw that three Rond\u00ed men were already trying to get into the belltower, and Rond\u00ed archers were trying to return fire, but the Zephyy had the high ground.Mireia circled around the building, and saw a thin window near the ground, evidence of a basement.

Quietly snuck behind the distracted Archer and slit his throat.Hot tears slid down her cheeks at what she was doing, especially as she felt and smelled fresh blood slide over her fingers. Hastily patting him down, she took a dagger from him and his arrows into the quiver she had... And went to the top floor.The Archer fired at her but the space was too compact. She rushed at him as he pulled his sword and they clashed. He was much stronger than her, and more desperate, and she fell onto her back, her sword clatterin from her grasp. He moved to impale her, and she rolled to the side and kicked hard at his legs. The Archer stumbled backwards, and her hands wrapped around a coil of rope that his boot heels landed on, and Mireia tugged with all her strength.The Zephyy man went falling trough the glass of the decorative bell tower and into the men below on the street, dying from the fall and the wounds inflicted by the Rondi.Mireia was shaking as she climbed to her feet with her blade in hand and went to the shattered window, just in time to watch Roxanne Fletcher ride by on her horse, a vision to all.

The sun had set, the dark had settled, and still men fell, still ships clashed, still fires raged. The bell stopped tolling, and smoke filled the sky, blocking out the stars that sparkled above them, heedless of the lives that were lost. At some point... at some point in the early hours of the morning, the fighting had come to an end.There was not a single clean person. There was not a single person without some sort of wound, varying from blisters of armor rubbing at once place to the dead bodies that floated in the crimson bay. Even the sand was red as waves ran up along the bay, ships half-sunk and totally sunk, debris and destruction floating all around Port Calar.The Dwarves of Khaldaruhm had a hard time pushing into the city, and in many of the streets and alleys, it seemed as if there were as many dead Rondi as there were Zephyy as there were mercenaries that could have been Rondi or Zephyy, it was too hard to tell with the blood and destruction everywhere. But, the victory was not insured until the rune-plated Dwarves finally did break through, pinching the magistrate into their defensive castle where they were now holed up.Most likely, they would starve in there. The rest of the city was \"won\", safe for this one fortress that still flew a Zephyy flag. Rondi flags waved from all other towers, however, and now... exhausted soldiers became exhausted custodians, searching bodies, gathering weapons, moving debris.Mireia sat and her hair was unbound, marking her as a woman. She had a bloody mouth, and a gash of on her forehead and arm. Mages were putting buildings back together again, and helping to heal others. She licked her lip and winced, and glanced up to see a dwarf among the people, drinking something from a flask. Mireia eyed it with tired curiosity.Roxanne, meanwhile, was look at as a near saint. Blood-washed and furious, her white hair almost stained pink, men looked to her for leadership on what to do about the fortress-castle where the leadership of the city was holed up.
