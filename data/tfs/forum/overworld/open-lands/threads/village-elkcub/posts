Some days it was only up for a few hours before falling again. Other times, it would shine for days and days on end. The nights were equally unpredictable. I think the record was...five days without sunlight, if I recall correctly. People were worried, but what could they do? After a few days, a girl appeared. Not much older than you, really. She was completely mute, couldn't speak a word. The priest and his family took her in. That night, we heard that tune playing, and all sat outside to listen. That's when the screaming started for the first time, coming from the priest's home. Some of us ran to look, and found the entire family torn apart, as though their lungs had been ripped from their bodies. The girl was nowhere to be found, and they all ran home. Not all of them made it back, though. Ever since then, we hear the screaming and the music each night.

This was all just this creature's creation, a play ground for it. She was their god. Killing her would probably kill the magic that kept this place alive. The sun itself would go out. The people themselves might even disappear. It was a dark train of thought, choosing between killing a god and leaving people to suffer beneath her whims. This was not her realm nor her territory.
