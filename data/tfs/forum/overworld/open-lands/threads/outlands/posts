In it's place, this great region is now home to nothing more than dangerous beasts and warring tribes of brutal, warlike humanoids that are collectively known as the Greentide.\u00a0Consisting of the brutish Orcs, snivelling Goblins and more, the Greentide accounts for all those malevolent, tribal creatures who wish for nothing more than to fight and conquer. There may be many types of so-called Greenskins with varying biological differences between them, but all can be characterised by a skin-tone ranging from muddy to bright green.\u00a0Only one thing is for certain in these forgotten parts: do not continue unless you're looking for a fight.GeographyThe region's geography is relatively simple, with thick and near-impassable mountains separating it from the rest of the continent, while a seemingly endless and featureless desert surrounds the rest for as far as the eye can see. The actual Outlands, which have a width of several hundred miles, consist of mostly barren canyons, desert and low mountain occasionally interspersed with rivers, strips of greenery and the dilapidated ruins of ancient sandstone settlements.\u00a0Besides this, one major feature remains: a huge, active super-volcano that blights the map with a large, blackened smear. Consistently releasing magma into the surrounding canyons, this volcano is known to the Greentide as the Heart of the World and most tribes avoid it if they can.====================Thread GuidelinesWelcome to the great IC megathread of green orciness!This thread is designed to be a big, IC region for Orc roleplay between characters and tribes. Expect lots of smashin' and conquerin'!Though these guidelines are not enforceable\u00a0as rules, I thought maybe the partakers of this thread location could all agree to stand by a few guidelines to make the roleplaying here more fun. As we know, the site enforces a rule of NPC counts for armies which help bring some order to large-scale conflicts between political entities. In this thread, for those roleplaying as tribal bosses or warlords, we could agree to do away with some of these for the sake of roleplay - but ONLY in this location and with the permission of our fellow players.\u00a0Each Greenskin character who wishes to be a tribal leader may have one hundred NPC points to play with as he wishes without needing a group, even if it's only you. Each player added to your Greentide faction can raise this by another hundred, similar to actual forum group mechanics (you may wish to consider actually creating a group for your tribe, too).\u00a0Even if you have the amount of characters needed to do so and can technically do so according to the rules, I would ask you refrain from making an actual forum nation meant to ICly represent this region and all the Greenskins within unless the majority of characters/players with Greenskin characters agree to this. Nothing's stopping you from migrating with your characters somewhere else to set up an entirely new nation, though!Please respect the fact that \"The Greentide\" refers to all the greenish-coloured miscreants as a whole, not just your particular idea. Similarly, due to the nature of the sandbox, there are more than one 'breed' of \u00a0Orcs/Orks/Goblins/Snots/Gremlins/Ogres/Trolls/Etcetera, with biological and cultural differences depending on the player who made them. Though generally, characters from the same tribe will probably be the same breed unless the tribal leader says otherwise, so respect that if you plan to make a character for another tribe to start with.Outside interference from other races/nations/groups is allowed but discouraged - you'll probably get smashed! Also, please don't come in with overwhelming forces of thousands and murder us all. I mean, we can't stop you but it would ruin our fun; we're not hurting anyone here... Except each other!Try to be somewhat original with your Orks. Being inspired by is fine, but other members of the forum probably don't want blatant Warhammer Orks running around screaming \"WAAAAGH!\" and everything.\u00a0As per the suggestion of someone in the OOC thread thingy, the Greentide often use teeth as a major currency.

The smarter Greenskin tribes who lived around the edges of the region fought over them for the right of control, for every so often a rich caravan or patrol from the outside would attempt to pass through into the wasteland for a variety of misguided reasons. Chief amongst them was exploration, but every so often an overconfident Lordling from outside might lead his troops through to 'claim' the territory and bring with them supplies, armour, weapons and more. One of these tribes was the Axetooth tribe, a small and relatively long-lasting tribe recovering from a string of major defeats in battle that led many of their remaining members to desert them. Those who still followed their tribal leader controlled one such pass on his behalf; a rather unsavoury position for any Greenskin, because the best fights were always further inland - as was the best loot. The job was one of boredom and frustration, waiting for victims to sally through so that they could fall upon them from all sides and take what was likely to be a meagre load not nearly enough to satiate the greed of the tribe's warriors. Then one day, an opportunity came that was not just exciting, but incredibly rare! Two hundred armed mercenaries, escorting a caravan some several hundred more strong on a mission of exploration and prospect. Once they entered sight, the sneaky, climbing goblins passed over razor rock, cliffs and bottomless crevasses to get word back to the Axetooth camp. When it arrived, the excitement spread like a wildfire from Orc to Orc and before long, the warriors began filing out to the sides of the pass where their traps had been lying in wait for weeks. No more eating of their own dead, no more rotten meat from carrion or vegetation from the riverside; they'd get a damn good meal, a damn good fight and possibly enough treasure to make even the greediest of them happy for a time. They did not wait for the word of their Boss, for what possible reason would any Orc have to deny them the opportunity of this attack? The first group there was a group of nine Orcs wielding spiked clubs, hammers, axes and any other brutish weapons they could fashion out of the material accessible to their tribe. The tenth was their superior officer, a veteran warrior called Magotar Doomslayer whose armour was rare in that it was not just made out of metal, but had enough spikes to make any of his underlings think twice about double-crossing him. Similarly, his weapons were two large axes he affectionately called \"Hacker\" and \"Slasher\" and had enough strength and weight behind them to chop any would-be challenger down to size.\u00a0\"Keep your damn mouths shut, or I'll break 'em,\" he growled at his men, crawling up towards the edge of the high ridge that overlooked the section of the pass they had especially cleared for ambushes. Behind and around them, the other veterans and their mobs of Orcs were filling in the gaps of their ambush and up high above on the other side, the subserviant Goblins were preparing to unleash the boulders they had mined into huge balls of crushing fury.\u00a0Magotar kept his head low, looking up to the west where a lookout stood hidden high in the rocks and waved a rag around to signal the near arrival of their guests. The orc's grin widened and his teeth cut the arid air that left his lungs. Within the next several minutes, the majority of the tribe had arrived, bar several of the higher-ranking officers and the Chief himself, who had no doubt been in the middle of tasting the Orc female who had recently come of age. His loss, Magotar thought as the first of the enemy stepped into view. It was a relatively standard formation, with the caravan's leaders at the front on the back of horses while the unarmed men were spread evenly between each third of the armed mercenaries hired to protect them.Perfect. The enemy would make easy pickings! The rocks would crush the middle section of the caravan, while Magotar and the other brutes around him dropped down onto the remaining, broken formation and killed as many as they could. Meanwhile, the separated front and all their officers would be swarmed by the rest of the warriors and devoured like a lizard in a den of snakes, only for them to all turn towards the rear and finish the final few off with the overwhelming, unstoppable force of a battle-starved Greentide.\u00a0They were getting closer...Magotar's patience was running thin, but he knew not to break too soon. Yet the desire for battle was greater than the desire for any Orc woman; the lust for the feeling of blood dripping from his axes filling his mind and the minds of those around him. The caravan continued to move, step by step; they were right under him now, the opportunity at it's greatest and their formation most susceptible to the waiting ambush. Then finally, as though the order to attack came to all green minds like a hive instinct, the warriors stood atop the ridges and released a roar that would shake the human warriors to their cores. The rocks were dropped, archers released their barbed arrows and Magotar kicked one of his men off the ridge and down into the fray of the coming battle; himself following shortly as he leaped from the rock and down into the bodies of his foes, all the while releasing a battle-cry of \"KILL 'EM ALL!\"The ambush went just as Magotar expected.\u00a0---------It was roughly an hour later when Gotrut, the chief of the Axetooth tribe, came down to see the results. He was a huge greenskin, at least seven foot tall and built of solid, rock-hard muscle. He wore little armour except his scars and his weapon was a huge hammer that, though Magotar could likely wield with both hands, Gotrut could swing with one.\u00a0\"What's goin' on 'ere then?\" The chief asked, his voice deep and full of growling teeth as he began to inspect the huge piles of armour, weapons, food and shiny coins his warriors piled into their wagons for transportation back to camp. Yet as soon as they were piled up into the wagons, groups of warriors would go and take their pickings; a shiny new sword, a helmet to protect their already thick skulls, or a trinket of gold or silver to trade for whatever it is they felt like buying but couldn't take. Magotar was amongst them, taking his fair share of the loot he helped to gain even as his green muscles were smeared red with the blood of those he had killed.\u00a0\"Gimme that, you runt,\" said Gotrut, snatching a bag of booty from one warrior, only to them kick him away. The moved to another, doing the same and leaving the underling frustrated and snarling. The third one he tried to take from was Magotar, who clutched tightly onto his bag and stared at his chief with a eyes that were wild like a beast.\u00a0\"Whaddayou think you're doin', boss?\" Magotar asked, his fist tightly clutching one side of his loot bag while Gotrut held the other.\u00a0\"Takin' my loot,\" Gotrut replied. \"You got a problem wit' that?\"\"This is my loot, I fought for it. We all get a share, don' we?\" Magotar replied.\u00a0\"When you do good and follow my orders, ya do,\" said Gotrut, suddenly pulling the bag away from Magotar and slapping him down to the sandy ground with a snarl. Then, he turned to the warriors of the Axetooth tribe and slammed his fist through the side of one of the wagons, allowing the gold to spill out into the pass once more. \"Listen up you puny gits, all o' this loot is mine now!\"The witnesses all let out cries of protest, but Gotrut shut them up by slamming his fist into the skull of the closest warrior and killing him instantly. No-one cared that one of their own had just been murdered by their chief. \"You get loot when you do what I tell ya to do! I neva said to kill t'ese paleskins, so as far as I care you all went against my orders an' forfeited the right to take from my stash o' booty!\"More growls of protest, but no-one did anything about it. \"You all got somethin' ta say?\" Gotrut asked, taking his hammer from his belt and wielding it menacingly. \"I'll kill every last one o' ya, you useless shits!\" He then waited for a reply, but none came except for grumbling sounds of submission. \"Good. Now get all dis back to my hold an' we can use all dis food to 'ave a feast and eat like Orcs!\"That was all he had to say. They were all hungry for a good meal, so did they really care about the weapons, armour and gold when they were promised a feast that would leave every one of them stuffed to the brim with good grub? No - and just like that, Gotrut proved himself just enough of a good boss to get nearly every warrior back on his side.Every warrior except Magotar. As the Axetooth tribe started pulling wagons back towards their camp, the one orc who had long felt the desire to take over the reigns of chief finally found his loyalty for Gotrut broken. \"Take my loot, will ya?\" He growled under his breath during the journey back. \"Slap me around? Threaten me? Take what I earned with my axes?\" He asked, looking up at the back of Gotrut as he led the orcs back to their camp.\"...

The raiding party itself was small for a Greenskin mob, only a couple dozen strong (a fraction of what was back in the swamp), and not one could be bothered to observe the natural beauty around them; dead or not.The crack and snap of dried branches could be heard as the mob brutishly and heavily barged through the wood, some Splitkulls stopping to rip down branches or pull up roots for improvised weapons. All of this could be heard above the normal quarrelling of the tribe amongst themselves.Brotgok was a mountain of a Greenskin at just a shade over 8-and-a-half feet tall in his normal hunched-over posture, with several hundred pounds of raw muscle clinging tight to his broad frame. \u2018Might makes right\u2019 in the Splitkull world, and it was because of his size and strength that Brotgok led the Splitkull, and of course the raiding party. This mountain of green flesh, covered in thick mud, was the undisputed Boss of the Splitkull Tribe.A familiar sound took the Boss\u2019 attention for a moment, and looking to his left he saw two of his tribe embroiled in a fight against one another. Two smaller Greenskins rolled on the dried forest floor, scratching, biting and throwing blows. The fight was the apparent product of one trying out his new improvised club on the other\u2019s skull, and for his experimentation the instigator of the fight found his own skull bashed into a tree. The tree shook as the thick bone of the Greenskin\u2019s skull stopped the rest of him with a hard crack. It was then that a glowing orb of yellow light escaped from a hole in the tree, flapping its bug-like wings in quiet panic as the slightly confused Splitkull watched on.After a few moments the initial novelty of watching the glowing orb wore off. In the tiny creature\u2019s escape it happened to fly within arm\u2019s reach of a Splitkull, who promptly reached out, snatching the pixie out of the air and shoved it in his mouth. He chomped the creature with a crunch, chewing as the other Greenskins looked on. The Splitkull smiled, letting out a laugh as he showed off sparking bits of yellow in his teeth.Immediately and in unison the other members of the tribe began thumping the trees. They cracked the large dead tree trunks with their fists, blades, axes, and clubs, occasionally getting lucky and driving more of the creatures out of the trees. The luckiest of them were able to catch the glowing orbs before they either escaped or were stolen by their tribe mates.

Magotar had enough cunning to know that waiting until his support grew was definitely the right thing to do, but until then his only choice was to continue following orders. Not long after their victory, those orders changed to him venturing from the relative safety and boredom of the pass and into the Outlands in order to hunt for boarphaunt meat and more goblin slaves. It was a welcome respite from the tribe hold, but it also offered Magotar the opportunity to improve his standing with the rabble of thirty orcs that had been sent out with him. It was a significant number, almost one-sixth of all the warriors in the Axetooth clan were under his command that day and would make a significant portion of his fighting force when he finally moved to take over the tribe himself. \"Boss, what's dat noise?\" One orc asked, pointing to the distance where the sound of chopping, smashing and cracking came from a forest of dead trees. \"Don' know,\" Magotar replied as he lead them closer to the source of the sound. \"Get yer weapons ready boys.\"As the patrol grew closer to Brotgok's position and passed into the woods, Magotar and his orcs instinctively lowered their postures and began to try and move a little quieter. Being orcs they weren't particularly great at moving unheard, but their background in ambushes made them rather good at knowing which things they could effectively hide their bulking green forms behind. He led them closer to the source of the sound and it wasn't long until Magotar's eyes noticed a few of Brotgok's orcs in the distance, apparently attacking the trees. He signalled for his own orcs to stop moving and take cover, then began edging closer and peeking between the drywood trunks in order to better assess the situation.

Raising his giant fist, the Boss decided he too would like some tasty glowing morsels, and so put his fist through the trunk of a dry hollow tree.

This, Brotgok thought, would at a minimum keep the boys of the two tribes from squabbling and fighting before the actual war was to begin. It may or may not have been a major problem for the Axetooth tribe, but if the Splitkull boys weren't fighting someone else they would certainly fight amongst themselves. Brotgok did not fear losing the other tribe by giving them a lead; it was easy enough to track creatures like orcs.The Splitkulls would trail behind the Axetooth until night fell, at which point Brotgok called for one of the smaller, more agile of his tribe. He gave the Greenskin orders to run ahead and tell the first Axetooth he encountered that the Splitkulls weren\u2019t going to stop; they would press on through the night and make the bulk of the two day journey before they rested. To humans this may have seem foolish, going on a force march the night before a battle was expected, but for Brotgok it made perfect sense. His Greenskins were strong and did not tire easily, and if they stopped none of them would rest knowing what lay ahead of them. It was just as well that they press on and try to make as much of the trip as possible.The sun was in the sky again as the Splitkull Greenskins approached the jagged mountain rage that separated The Outlands from the rest of the world beyond; this would be where the Axetooth tribe proper, headed by Gotrut. It was only now that Brotgok would order a stop/rest, and give the Axetooth detachment time to go ahead into their camp.Brotgok sat perched on a rock, looking in the direction of their target as one of his Greenskins approached.\u201cBoss,\u201d the boy began \u201cYou fink daze goin\u2019 ta do wot daze sayin\u2019? Wot if dem Axeteef iz layin\u2019 us a trap?

If daze no armors in\u2019ner, den we takes it off the dead Greenskins.\u201dThe boss\u2019s assumption quickly proved correct; even when his mob had a chance to sit or even lay down, they were restless. The boys picked at each other, fighting and in one or two cases literally butting heads. The promise of a real fight, a \u2018war\u2019 even against other Greenskins had them all on edge, chomping at the bit like dogs before a hunt. There may have been no rest, but the Axetooth detachment did have time to rejoin their mob, and that\u2019s all that mattered.As the sun listlessly drifted higher into the sky, Brotgok stood, and began walking towards the mountains and the camp that was undoubtedly at the base of them. Of course his mob followed. As the Axetooth camp came into sight, Brotgok stopped.\u201cBOYZ!\u201d he screamed, \u201cLEZ SEE IF WE\u2019Z CAN GET DAZE ATTENTION!\u201dAnd with that, chaos erupted once again. Guttural screaming, howling, and cheering carried across the clearing between the Splitkull Tribe and the waiting Axetooth camp. The boys thumped the ground, stomped, and quickly whipped themselves into a frenzy. Brotgok pulled the hardened bone club from the rope tied around his waist and joined his boys, crashing the heavy club into the ground and adding to the thunderous disturbance his mob was making.\u201cWAR WAR WAR WAR\u201d a continuous and clear chant carried across to the Axetooth camp.

His tribe may have been known in recent years to lay ambushes, but at one time Gotrut led a far larger and more powerful clan; one that roamed the wastes and fought everything it saw with a ruthless ferocity comprised of gnashing teeth and sharpened axes. They were orcs, after all, no stranger to great effort even if such efforts had been lax for what had been far too long. On top of this, the warriors led by Magotar were often sent on long treks to find sources of food to bring home - which was a point he'd have to explain; the food they had caught was no great haul and Magotar would have to explain why.\u00a0When the agile member of the Splitkulls came to him during the night, Magotar sent him back to Brotgok with a warning: \"Gotrut is cunnin' and fierce. Make sure your boys are ready for an 'ard fight.\"As expected, the Axetooth Renegades re-entered their camp in the side of the mountain; a medium-sized, rather impressively decorated fortified camp that was one of the only dots of note on an otherwise blank and arid map of rocky hills and sand-covered mountains. The camp itself was located on a large plateau with only one entrance in the form of a wide slope leading up to it that had obviously been mined into shape by strong, green muscle. At the top of this slope was a heavy, wooden gateway made out of scavenged wood and pieces of metal that had no actual close-able gate aside from a length of sharpened Cheval de frise that was clearly designed to be dragged in front of the opening in the event of an attack. Four sentry towers stood at this slope; two at the back flanking the gatehouse and two further forwards, at the top of the cliff-walls either side of the slope. All four had orc archers looking out for trouble, or simply shooting from them out of boredom.Behind this gate, an orc camp was in full swing. Several large bonfires dotted the location, with each surrounded by huts that were once temporary, yet made permanent with the addition of wagon-parts taken from raids or logs cut from the scarce trees they could find. The largest hut was at the very back, towering over the others by at least twice the size and made further notable by the large, horned orc skull painted across the entire front in white. It was clearly the home of the chief, Gotrut Axetooth.\u00a0Yet for all of this, it had it's weaknesses; females, children and resource stockpiles. If the plan went correctly? They would all be in Magotar's hands, while Gotrut stood outside with his warriors knowing they were no longer in his reach. Gotrut was chief, a position that entitled him to many wives and children and as sadistic and psychopathic as the Greentide often were, any of them who wasn't a fool would recognize why such things were worth protecting.\u00a0------------Several hours of waiting passed for Magotar's men, who huddled around the bonfire in their section of the camp and waited for the attack to begin. Magotar himself spent that time roaming, scheming and calling to arms all those who would actually consider following him against the orc who had led them on a steady, sloping decline since they first settled that accursed plateau. It was quite the success, with the orcs pledging themselves to Magotar roughly doubling in number on account of the respect many of the Axetooth had for his battle prowess and his ways. In addition - Gotrut did not even leave his tent to greet the returning hunting party, meaning their lack of food was questioned by no orc worth listening to.\u00a0And then it happened: the appearance of the Splitkull, the chanting of the challenge to war and the guttural roars of Brotgok's warriors that reached all the way to the inside of Gotrut's hold. Within moments, orcs and goblins began beating the heavy drums of war and several orc archers filed into the sentry towers and the top of the plateau to prepare to shoot down on the coming force. Yet the punishment for acting without orders was still fresh on many of their minds and not one of them fired their arrows or threw their spears...\u00a0From the Splitkull perspective, nothing seemed to happen for several minutes except the rallying of the Axetooth warriors to the top of the slope. Many of them were well-armed, armoured and brimming for a fight - yet equally dangerous was their number, dozens upon dozens of them, possibly a little over a hundred all itching and clawing for blood. Their chants echoed down over the others, chants of \"KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL!\" beating through the mountains louder than even the war-drums made to inspire them - chants that slowly began to die down as a figure taller than them began to push through from the back until he reached the very front of his tribe.\u00a0\"GOTRUT! GOTRUT! GOTRUT!\" The chanting changed as the chief made himself known, a ferocity on his face that looked unmatched. Yes, it was true that Brotgok was about a foot taller than he was, but this meant nothing to the veteran Greentide boss. Gotrut's teeth were sharpened, his tusks reaching out from a jaw so square it looked like he could chew through solid steel! And one eye, though blinded by a horrifying scar, was far prettier than the rest of him; an orc covered from head to toe in decades old battle-scars of stab-wounds, slices and hacks. Oh yes, Brotgok was bigger than he was, but Gotrut was had clearly earned his position through a string of wars and battles that would leave the most rugged veteran of Greentide kind feeling queasy. Gotrut was not just rare because of his power, he was rare because he was old.\u00a0A huge, muscled arm raised his great warhammer to his shoulder with a thud that seemed to reverberate down to his feet and shake the ground beneath him. Slowly, Gotrut stepped forwards and pierced the enemy mob with a glare that looked positively scarlet. \"An' 'oo are 'dese gits?\" His voice came, like a bone scraping against brick in a growl so deep his entire tribe suddenly went silent. \"You 'ere to kill me? Kill my tribe? Take my t'ings?\" He asked, finding the largest orc in the enemy mob - Brotgok, whose size didn't matter one bit to him. \"You boys better turn aroun' an' run right now or I'm comin' down t'ere an' I'm gonna crush every one o' yous myself an' use your bones to make bread!\"Magotar wasn't lying about Gotrut's shrinking popularity, yet it was clear he was fierce and orcish enough to keep a hold like an iron fist over a large portion of his warriors. The total size of his tribe's fighting boys must have been at least one hundred and fifty - and one hundred of them began to follow Gotrut as he began a slow, intimidating march down to the bottom of the slope.\u00a0Yet back there, in the camp, Magotar's own followers were rallying. Sixty good warriors, all ready to spring and take over the plateau the moment Gotrut's orcs were drawn out of it. For a moment, Magotar considered betraying Brotgok too - but he decided against it, knowing he was an ally worth having if he was orc enough to stand against Gotrut.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "As with the Splitkull, the Axetooth renegades marched on through the night with a similarly tireless determination.

Brotgok didn\u2019t bother shouting back an answer to what little bit he may have heard the opposing boss say. He wouldn\u2019t even bother to exchange names with Gotrut, seeing as there were only two possible ends to the day; one in which the Axetooth boss was dead, in which case names no longer mattered, and the other in which the Splitkull Boss was dead along with his mob, in which case names no longer mattered.What the Greentide Boss did do, however, was charge.As soon as the last Axetooth boys were clear of the camp, Brotgok synched his club back into the rope around his waist, and set off in a flat, fearsome gallop towards the Axetooth.

The battle on the side of the Axetooth immediately turned into chaos, caring not for orders, formations or anything other than the desire to destroy what clearly seemed to be a weaker force. All of Gotrut's orcs were outside the camp at this point, save the few archers who stayed behind to man the towers and plateau walls. This presented Magotar with his opportunity, who climbed one of the towers overlooking the battle and, as the greenskins besides him shot their arrows towards the enemy horde, slowly retrieved his axes from his belt and swung them into the backs of those old companions until their shoulders were bereft their heads.

The advantage of Gotrut's numbers fell immediately, for they were now surrounded and lacking a direction to retreat. A sure victory for the alliance? Absolutely not, for while they had the technical and tactical advantage in the battle, Gotrut's orcs now had no choice but to fight as fiercely as possible.

Their home, such as it was, must have looked increasingly abandoned as the Greenskins started to file out of the swamp in bursts, the departing war bands seeking to follow the steps of the tribe's Warboss Brotgok Bul-Krozak . The Boss had some days ago led a couple dozen of the Orks out to look for materials with which to make some more conventional armor, and had not since returned. Being Greenskins, and Splitkulls to boot, the members of the tribe who searched for their Boss didn't do so out of any emotional attachment to Brotgok; it was because if Brotgok had fallen, the tribe needed a new Warboss, and one might even be named immediately upon his discovery. Changes of power normally happened quickly and brutally in Greentide culture, and the simple act of being absent from the discovery might disqualify an Ork from having his say before\u00a0one of the bigger Orks\u00a0swept in and claimed power for himself.The mob that made the point of the spear that was the staggered groups of unorganized\u00a0Greenskins was perhaps a dozen Orks strong, with about half as many Greenlings in tow. Each and every one of the Greenskins were, of course, covered head to toe in the thick, foul smelling mixture of awfulness that was the contents of their swamp; a blackish brown mud/tar mixture that the Splitkulls believed protected them in battle. Covered in their protective 'armor' and armed with their looted or improvised weapons, the mob would eventually happen to see something they had never seen before. It started as a dot in the sky, and the Orks all at once stopped and gaped at the shape as it soon came into focus. They watched until\u00a0the creature\u00a0descended out of sight over a ridge, obviously headed for one of the only sources of water (or even life) in the Outlands.After a moment, one Ork, one of the largest in the group,\u00a0spoke up. \"You'z fink daz de Boss?\"\"Da Boss don' 'ave wings ya git!\", another would quickly answer. This elicited laughs from the other Orks.The big Ork would growl. \"I know da Boss aint gots wings!\" he shouted, obviously not pleased with being laughed at, \"Wot if dat wot\u00a0does got wings can see da Boss?!\"After another moment of silence a third Ork would add, \"Wot if dat wot gots wing killed da Boss?\"The big Ork began walking towards the ridge that would lead them to the oasis. \"Den 'eez got some big teef.\" he said, alluding to the\u00a0Splitkulls' proclivity for the use of 'teef' as currency.The rest of the mob would follow. The Splitkull didn't even have a word for 'dragon', but if this winged beast killed their Boss, each and every Ork among them would jump\u00a0at the chance to face it in battle.

This seemed strange to Brotgok; in his mind he couldn't imagine being on either side of this equation, being either the Gotrut loyalist or the one taking them prisoner. In Gotrut's death, the statement Magotar had put forth was proved to be true; Gotrut was no longer fit to lead Greenskins. If he was, he'd be alive and fighting. Being loyal to a dead Warboss not fit for his station was outside of the Splitkull way of thinking entirely. Additionally, taking them captive was just as absurd. You kill your enemies, not capture them, and any Ork willing to be captured (meaning, not willing to fight) should be killed anyway. Again being of the same species seemed to matter little, differences between the tribes abounded.The words of the newly minted Axetooth Warboss reached Brotgok.

There was a lot of insecurity going around, mostly coming from the women and children of those whose orc sires had been killed in the combat and whose loyalties lay with Gotrut. However, Magotar's rather imposing form and stature of domination and chieftainship put at ease many of the disturbances he saw - it was rather obvious to all that the Axetooth Tribe had a new leader: Magotar Doomslayer.Gotrut's great hold was now held by Magotar's boys, who pushed open the large, heavy wooden doors and allowing their new chief into the large, open space inside. A large throne of wood, metal shards and bone was the centrepiece at the far side, besides which Gotrut's remaining family were bound and waiting to hear their fate with an air of spite about them. \"I'll deal with 'dem later,\" he told his mob, instead turning and following a guide out into one of the few side rooms that led down into a dug-out basement. Inside he found all of the 'loot' that Gotrut had been hoarding; arms, armour and shiny things, all piled from corner to corner, floor to ceiling. Magotar was sure there was enough to reward his tribe three times over, bringing him to sigh in relief that it was even still there. If it wasn't, if Gotrut had somehow traded it away or 'spent it', he would have had to have killed Brotgok and his mob. Now, at least, he could be known as someone who honoured his word.-----An hour later, several wagons filled with weapons, armour and fancy trinkets were rolled out to Brotgok and his boys. Magotar gave a nod to the boss, then gestured to the wagons with a large hand. \"Let me be known as a chief who keeps his word.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"Soon as we get it,\" Magotar told Brotgok, watching the final few Axetooth orcs being led back into the camp. \"I ain' been in 'is longhouse in over a year, so 'e must keep it in there I reckon.

The Splitkull boys set about digging through the wagons on the spot, putting on armor they'd been missing and testing the shiny trinkets with their teeth. Of course there was the requisite squabbling over spoils. More than one boy ended up on the receiving end of a punch or clubbing over a trinket, weapon, or bit of armor.\"Push 'em down da hill. We'z goin' back.\" Brotgok instructed, and soon the boys would be dragging the wagon loads of loot to the ramp, and pushing them down the hill; the first step\u00a0of what would likely be a longer trip home and the journey there had been.As the Splitkull Warboss turned to walk down the ramp after his mob, he would have one last thing to say to Magotar.\"I'z radder you be knowed as a Chief wot leads proper Greenskins. You'z a Boss now, an' if you'z go da way of Gotrut, I'z be back ta put your teef on my pole right next ta 'iz.

Powerful jaws and claws ripped into and broke the poor animal, snapping the limbs off with relative ease as her teeth continued to shred the meat from the bones.Granted, neither of the animals held much on them - but it was better than nothing. It filled her belly. That was the main goal. There was a point that her head whipped violently from side to side, snapping the head clean off the neck in a pure display of strength. It helped curb her aggression a little bit... and boosted her ego in the case that something or someone was watching.The corpse almost stripped clean, Aepessa dropped the remains and turned her head with maw open to bite into the second beast - stopping as her gaze caught just a flicker of movement coming over that ridge on the other side of the pitiful watering hole.

Anyone could guess and speculate. For now, it continued to descend for a low mountain bearing a river that supported a descent little savanna. At least there was likely to be a little game here, and she was hungry.<br/><br/>Her shadow swept over the land and it stirred a heard of something into flight in panic. The dragon, herself, made into a bank to come around and chase after the fleeing prey - gliding in low as she watched what appeared to be a thin number of gazelle bounding their racing hearts out to get away. As she neared in she stretched out her claws, and she went into a fluid swap of flight into a hard gallop of her own as he wings snapped in.<br/><br/>She did enjoy a good chase occasionally. She was gaining easily on a couple of the beasts, and with a rounded lift her head she would make a hard throw of her skull to bash into one of them and send it flying into another - two for one. The rest of the herd ran for their lives, and she pounced on the two helpless ones scrambling to find their feet.

Being Greenskins, and Splitkulls to boot, the members of the tribe who searched for their Boss didn't do so out of any emotional attachment to Brotgok; it was because if Brotgok had fallen, the tribe needed a new Warboss, and one might even be named immediately upon his discovery. Changes of power normally happened quickly and brutally in Greentide culture, and the simple act of being absent from the discovery might disqualify an Ork from having his say before\u00a0one of the bigger Orks\u00a0swept in and claimed power for himself.</p><p><br/></p><p>The mob that made the point of the spear that was the staggered groups of unorganized\u00a0Greenskins was perhaps a dozen Orks strong, with about half as many Greenlings in tow. Each and every one of the Greenskins were, of course, covered head to toe in the thick, foul smelling mixture of awfulness that was the contents of their swamp; a blackish brown mud/tar mixture that the Splitkulls believed protected them in battle. Covered in their protective 'armor' and armed with their looted or improvised weapons, the mob would eventually happen to see something they had never seen before. It started as a dot in the sky, and the Orks all at once stopped and gaped at the shape as it soon came into focus.

This elicited laughs from the other Orks.</p><p><br/></p><p>The big Ork would growl. \"I know da Boss aint gots wings!\" he shouted, obviously not pleased with being laughed at, \"Wot if dat wot\u00a0does got wings can see da Boss?!\"</p><p><br/></p><p>After another moment of silence a third Ork would add, \"Wot if dat wot gots wing killed da Boss?\"</p><p><br/></p><p>The big Ork began walking towards the ridge that would lead them to the oasis. \"Den 'eez got some big teef.\" he said, alluding to the\u00a0Splitkulls' proclivity for the use of 'teef' as currency.</p><p><br/></p><p>The rest of the mob would follow. The Splitkull didn't even have a word for 'dragon', but if this winged beast killed their Boss, each and every Ork among them would jump\u00a0at the chance to face it in battle. In the span of not more than 15 minutes, the Orks\u00a0would be able to\u00a0be seen cresting the ridge that separated them and the oasis.<br/></p><div class=\"quote_clear\"></div></div></div>"}, "post-62126": {"user": "Splitkull Tribe", "user_num": 2116, "timestamp": "1490744427000", "message": "As the small Splitkull mob crested the ridge, the large winged beast in the oasis below would be impossible to miss.
