Wolves were following the two men, but hunting was not on their minds. Their eyes were hollow, entranced almost. \"The power of this wood, that which we have to kill, it senses when something comes in and its sending its sentries to have a look at us. We're still just on the edge, so for now we pass, what with being alive. Deeper in though....\" He said, putting an arm forth to stop Chance. There was a thick root on the wood's trail in an almost perfect line across. Vidkun drew one of his pistol crossbows, and put it across the root's line. Quite suddenly one of the following wolves ran forth and infront of the pair, growling, while others closed in. Vidkun retracted the weapon, and they stopped, but now watched. He put an unarmed hand across the line, and although the wolves watched it there was no reaction, a state that remained when he slowly crossed the line with all his weapons holstered. \"This is in part for me to gauge your skills and behaviours for how we are to work in the future; thus, you choose: do we force our way in to our quarry, or do we try for the soft approach until right upon it?\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<div>Vidkun looked into the eyes of Chance and saw nothing in them.

Oh,\" He switched to a whisper, \"When hunting a deer you get close enough to make the shot while trying not to startle it. When hunting a man you'd stay on the defensive until 'ya fuck 'em at the very end.'\" Chance had heard that from someone in the past but couldn't remember who, \"But I don't think either of those situations apply now. If our game is not startled we should proceed with caution. Though if the foe knows we are coming it would be best not to walk into a trap. I guess we should get closer and hope we are lucky.

That gives us an advantage over a threatened animal.\"The old ranger knowledge and wiccan war logic came back into the young man's memory as he thought through the situation.

The eyes of the wolves were upon him, but once Chance came over and advanced with him it would seem the creatures wouldn't follow, instead remaining at the magical border of the wood.\u00a0As the pair progressed their surroundings got strange. Glowing butterflies flew by, blue deer with two heads ran across their path, snakes intertwined with each other like rope slithered alongside them for a time. Trees twisted in long loops, while a few seemed to be growing from the sky, leaves down near them whilst the trunks extended ever into the sky. Clearly someone here forgot about following the rules of physics, a fact confirmed in finality as a fox ran straight through a boulder, one which would be as hard and solid as expected if touched. A soft pink and green mist rolled across as even more time passed, warming but never hot. A sound like a knife drawn across a cymbal would echo in one's ears, before at last a singing could be heard. It was quiet, but with every step getting louder exponentially. One would get tired, comfortable and happy, feeling the draw of sleep as it went on and even Vidkun - long since trained to resist similar malefic blasphemies from witches or vampires - skipped a step before he drew a dark side-sword in one hand and a hand-crossbow in another. \"She is here, push forward!\" He shouted, bringing his sword down on one of the thick coils of snakes going by them, some twelve creatures cleaved through in one swing before raising his hand crossbow to fire it's two bolts behind at the wolves swiftly running to them. Two went down, but there were several more going alongside. Vidkun replaced the unloaded weapon with a vile knife and sprinted forward. Yet, he would not go far before from the top of a palm-like tree a tiger with a glossy rainbow coat dropped upon him. It tried to bite off his knife-arm but its razor teeth screeched upon a steel vambrace. He grunted in pain as its claws dug into his shoulders, but he couldn't get it off; as he swung the sword in his other arm there wasn't enough space to get either a heavy slash or stab. The light slices and stabs he had space for weren't very effective, the creature clearly not caring about pain and still having a large reserve of blood. \"Help me!\" he shouted impotently, as more creatures closed upon them.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Vidkun listened to the lad, a judgmental eye upon him with little to no emotion upon his face.
