Lanterns in lead-like metal illuminate green light which is warm on skin but makes conscious, thoughtful people a little unnerved. Plants all around emanate smell of wet mint clearing one\u2019s mind with sharpness of its smell.The double door of manor itself is made of smooth ebony with silver inscribing similar to one on the iron gates. There is no handle outside of the door. Windows from outside are covered with heavy curtains of purple velvet. There is a small clock tower atop of the roof with ornate, mosaique windows beneath.The weather around the manor is consistently cloudy and wet with often precipitation however, not cold to the point of discomfort.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/014/291/861/large/dimitar-marinski-estate.jpg?1543356082"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/014/291/861/large/dimitar-marinski-estate.jpg?1543356082\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}}
