Icy winds howl through the rigid peaks of the snowy mountains, concocting a panoply of perpetual snowstorms and avalanches, which make it easy for any traveler to get lost.  Very few outsiders dare to tread here, and those who do rarely make it out alive.  If it isn\u2019t the horrendous weather or environment which kills you, then it will be the ancient beasts which lurk beneath the surface of the mountains.  Despite the dangers, however, the Mountain Tribes call this place their home.Historically, the Mountain Tribes sweep down into the lowlands to compete with the Varan of Valland, only to be beaten back time and time again.  Legends say Hemhildr of Wulfenheim ventured into the Shattered Peaks to slay Slivr, a great serpent which dwelled in the depths of the mountains.
