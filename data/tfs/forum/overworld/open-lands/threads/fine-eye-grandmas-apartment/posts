Upon entry one will find themselves in a relatively spacious foyer. High ceilings leave enough room for a small balcony to overlook the foyer while massive windows coupled with some magic illusions give the appearance of sunlight shining in. In the middle of this room sits an oaken table with eight chairs surrounding it, a number of papers and books along with the occasional auction item can usually be found resting on it.\u00a0Underneath the balcony, there is a hallway leading to several bedrooms, a washroom, a small study, and even a vault for goods purchased at The Fine Eye.
