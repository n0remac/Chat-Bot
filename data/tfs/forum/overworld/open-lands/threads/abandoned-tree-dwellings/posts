His eyes scanned the trees below, searching with intense scrutiny. He shifted his weight and dipped down towards the canopy, letting his feathers skim the leaves. He had one talon curled in towards his body, claws dancing with antsy discomfort for something that was missing.Eventually, he came to perch on a high branch, fingernails digging into the skin of his thumb. These massive trees bathed the land below in shadow, and through the greenery was rather inviting, the seeker could not summon any excitement within himself to dive down where the sun could not guide him.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The sun was high in the air, and with it, a companion."}, "post-89275": {"user": "Kari Valkyrja", "user_num": 3168, "timestamp": "1550689205000", "message": "Kari herself wandered along the forest floor, aiming to do a little hunting that day.
