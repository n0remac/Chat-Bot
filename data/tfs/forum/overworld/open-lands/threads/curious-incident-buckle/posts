Nel was surrounded by darkness, with just a tiny circle of light up above her. The pit was completely silent, save for her own breathing and the sounds of the rope and metal on stone. However, the calm was soon broken by a sudden earthquake. The tunnel shook and rumbled, bits of brick falling down on top of her. It shook for a solid minute, by the end of which Nel found herself hanging upside down by a rope. The arrows she was using to climb had fallen out of the stone, and had been lost. However, her lifeline back to the surface still held strong.Back on the surface, Mordane and the others would feel no such tremor. The crowd buzzed with excitement as Nel descended, and Ollie chattered happily to anyone who would listen about how he was going to write her story and become a best-selling author.
