She was very lucky the tree decided to fall the way it did.It had been a long day. Tarik\u2019s back and arms were sore from the almost ceaseless labour he was exerting. His team had just finished felling one of the iron woods in the area and was heading back to the lumber village of Forest hill. Before such a task was done maybe once a month at most. Tarik shook his head at that concept, only once a month. Now ever since trade has picked up with the outside world his team was cutting down one of the great iron woods at least once a week. The pay was good sure, he was able to buy new clothes for his daughter and a new bed frame for the house. His back on the other hand, protested anyway. It was while massaging his back as he walked that his team and Tarik heard it. The almighty snapping of wood as loud as a crack of lighting, followed by a crash similar to that of a thunderous roar. Tarik and his teamed stopped, craning their necks trying to find where the sound came from. \u201cIs anyone else got a tree in the area?\u201d Tarik asked one of his workmen, a younger man, sixteen and just starting to grow the great muscles of his trade. \u201cNope, Balson\u2019s team is to the north.\u201d He replied, shaking his head. \u201cThen what the in The Place Beyond just felled a tree?\u201d Tarik replied, readying his might axe. \u201cCome on lads we gotta find out.\u201d He pointed in the general direction of the sound. Begrudgery the rest of his half a dozen team complied and readied their woodsmen axes. Although the Silent Militia had combed through these woods and cleared out any bandit camps, you never knew when a small band might slip through the roving patrols.  Spreading out into a straight line it took them just over 20 minutes to reach the location of the recently fallen tree. Tarik was marvelling at it, an old tree at that but still too young to fall under its own weight. \u201cSpread out\u201d He commanded. \u201cLook for tracks!\u201dHe was inspecting what seemed to be burn marks at the base of the tree where it had snapped when he heard a cry behind him.\u201cTarik!\u201d one of his men yelled, feverishly. \u201cGet over here quick!\u201d He turned and sprinted to where the man was yelling from, mounting a hilltop from where the tree\u2019s roots resided he saw it. \u201cShit.\u201d Is all he could say. Below him, in the arms of one of the lumberjacks was a woman. No older then eighteen, dressed all in white, stained in red and unconscious. A bolt or arrow protruding from her shoulder. The man cradling the girl, quickly ripping his shirt and bandaging the wound, she had lost a lot of blood, the forest floor around her sticky with it. \u201cMust have gotten shot by a bandit and ran off.\u201d One of the others said trailing off, his face in shock. \u201cQuick, bundle her up, we gotta get her to the fort!\u201d Tarik said loudly, snapping several of the men out of their shocked silence. \u201cBoy\u201d He turned to the youngest of them, the still athletic one. \u201cRun ahead and get us a cart from the village, along with the herbalist and the fastest mules. We\u2019ll meet you at the cross roads.\u201d The boy looked dumbfounded at him. Tarik reached the boy and smacked him rough on the head. \u201cNow boy, now!\u201d Tarik yelled. At that the young man nodded and sprinted back into the forest, dropping his axe. \u201cQuick, lets get back to the road. She\u2019s lucky she\u2019s so close to the place to begin with. He was about to head off when he saw a small orb on the ground next to the woman, which had obviously tumbled out of her hands. \u201cTake that too.\u201d He pointed at the strange sphere, directing one of the lumberjacks to pick it up. \u201cIt might help tell us who she is.\u201d Bundled up in the now ragged cloth of the lumberjacks she was quickly transported to the forests edge. Where the boy as well as the mules pulling the cart he rode on were out of breath. In the back of the cart was the village herbalists, a older woman almost as old as the tree\u2019s around them. She directed the girl to be laid down on the carts back and quickly began working on the wound as best she could. \u201cShe\u2019s lost a lot of blood\u201d She stated \u201cShe needs proper care. You were right to get me.\u201d She said, looking at Tarik now. \u201cWe need to get to the fort, as soon as possible. Get in.\u201d She commanded him. Without thinking, Tarik obliged. Once in the passanger seat at the front of the cart he turned to his compatriots. \u201cReturn home, I\u2019ll come back when I can.\u201d He turned to one of the men. \u201cGive me that ball we found.\u201d One of them handed him the device. It was heavy and as big as his fist. That was all he could understand of it before the mules were commanded forward, hurdling as fast as they could to the Fort through the forest road. \u201cShe\u2019s beginning to come to.\u201d Spoke the herbalist behind him, he turned to look back. The girl was indeed starting to move, groaning and instinctively grabber her wounded arm.\u201cWhy hello sweety the herbalist said softly. Your in a safe place, we\u2019re taking you to a place where you can heal.\u201d", "link_list": ["/post/90181/thread", "/user/3394"], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/oLuitO3.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@nine\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/90181/thread\" timestamp=\"1557644319\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-3394\" title=\"Nine\"><img alt=\"Nine Avatar\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/oLuitO3.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/90181/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1557644319000\" title=\"May 11, 2019 22:58:39 GMT -8\">May 11, 2019 22:58:39 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-3394 group-0\" href=\"/user/3394\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@nine\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Nine</span></a></span> said:</div>A flying crossbow bolt, an explosion of pain, and a flash of light.

She feared she had been recaptured already, and desperately hoped she that wasn't the case.The cart was hurdling through the rough dirt and gravel road towards the fort. The young boy at the reigns only barely able to keep the mules under control as they turned quickly at sharp angles. Occasionally he would have to yell for people to move out of the way moments before passing them. Leading to many a passing traveler or peasant throwing themselves to the road side in desperation to get out of the oncoming storm. \u201cWhat did she say?\u201d Asked Tarik, trying to both turn around in his seat in the front, as well as not get thrown from the cart in its desperate rush through the woods.\u201cSomething about a garden.\u201d Replied the old Herbalist mid-way through removing the roughly tied bandages of the lumberjack. Removing the bandages the herbalist tried to remove the underlying cloth as slowly and delicately as possible as the cart bumped and swayed on the path. \u201cWe\u2019re taking you to Fort Silence, it\u2019s a nearby, uh..Fort.\u201d Spoke Tarik to the girl as the herbalist was busy crushing some sort of leaves that she had retrieved from a satchel she carried and quickly grinding it into a paste. \u201cJust a little way up now.\u201d\u201cNow girl,\u201d Spoke the herbalist rubbing the area surrounding the crossbow bolt with the paste, \u201cThis is going to sting.\u201d The cart by now reached the crossroads to the fort. The road here was smoother than the surrounding roads. Tt had only recently been placed in the last few weeks as the fort became more of a hub of activity in the area. \u201cWe\u2019re almost there.\u201d Shouted the boy from the front, glad to be off the rough and windy roads and onto the straight and smooth recently laid gravel path.After applying the herbal paste, the old very delicately held onto the crossbow bolt and snapped it in half, with now only the bottom half still implanted into the young woman\u2019s arm. \u201cPull it out!\u201d Yelled Tarik to the herbalist. \u201cIf we do that, we\u2019ll kill her.\u201d Replied the herbalist tersely.\u201cYoung lady, do you remember how you got shot?\u201d Spoke the herbalist, applying a clean bandage to her wound quickly and concisely. The Fort was now starting to appear in the horizon through the great Ironwood trees. Mostly hidden within the mountainside itself, the odd turret or window could be seen poking out of the jagged edges of the mountain. A great cave mouth rapidly coming into view like a giant mouth ready to swallow them whole. The boy was yelling now, not at traders, but armored militiamen, wielding plated armor and pikes that were walking down in formation to their patrol locations, or returning from them. The soldiers appearing both surprised, confused and hostile by the sudden and rapid arrival of the lumberyard cart. Once Tarik joined his louder voice in the boys warnings and alarms eventually a bell could be heard in the distance, signifying that someone at the fort had heard them. \u201cWounded, I have wounded!\u201d Yelled the boy as he barreled up the hills to the entrance to the cave mouth which served as the entrance to the fort as well.

The opposition from the guards becoming more coordinated now as their surprise and confusion was beginning to fade. Eventually one militiaman, a squad leader by the looks of his dyed red left shoulder plate, was brave enough to step in front of the cart, his long spear held tightly in his hands, pointed directly at the charging mules, causing the young boy to quickly slow down. \u201cWhat in the gods do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d He bellowed at the young boy at the helm of the cart, now trying to desperately sooth the horses from trampling the guard. Tarik turned now to the squad leader and bellowed back. \u201cWe found a slave girl shot by a bolt escaping her masters not far from here. She\u2019s barely alive.\u201d \u201cSlavers? Here? So close to the fort?\u201d He said in shock and surprise. \u201cHow did they get so close?\u201d He said to himself quietly. Moving quickly out of the way he spoke once more to the cart. \u201cOur healer isn\u2019t here right now, he\u2019s out on a relief mission further north. \u201cCorvus is here though, if you want to risk it.\u201d The young boy began to spur the mules on once more, past the guard. \u201cCorvus?!\u201d Yelled Tarik back at the guard as he passed him. \u201cHow in the beyond is a witch doctor gonna help a bolt wound?\u201d \u201cHe knows his stuff\u201d Spoke the guard, now behind them. \u201cEven if he is a bit, strange.\u201dThe cart was now back to its old pace, but it seemed the guard\u2019s message was faster, the men ahead swiftly got out of their way. With several of them quickly heading down the path in patrol formation. It seemed the arrival of slavers this deep into the valley was of serious concern to the Militia. As they rose to further up towards the mountain base proper, and the cave mouth becoming larger and larger, they noticed individuals waiting for their arrival. Two seemed to be medics from the militia, carrying a stretched between them, and a tall, thin man wearing what seemed to be an old, ragged and patched up medical coat, stained with time a dark brown shade. \u201cWelcome to Fort Silence!\u201d spoke the thin man as they approached, and the cart slowed. His voice high and some what excited. He instructed the two medics to load the now lightly breathing girl into the stretcher. He inspected the girls wounds, tsked to himself and faced the herbalist. \u201cWe\u2019ll take it from here Lorien, your care has been most adequate.\u201d The old woman nodded in reply, now storing what remained of her supplies back into her satchels. \u201cSomeone better pay for all that, I used up a lot of my stock for her.\u201d \u201cSomething will be arranged.\u201d Spoke Corvus. \u201cNow quickly move her inside, she will require, more advanced care.\u201d Corvus said, somewhat excited at the challenge. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving her with you.\u201d Spoke Tarik, still in the passenger seat of the cart. \u201cYour witching ways might kill her faster then the bolt would.\u201d The thin man turned to face his accuser as the girl was being moved to the stretcher by the two medics. \u201cI can assure you, she will be healed of her injuries, you have my word.\u201d He said quickly, annoyed at the interference.\u201cNot gonna happen.\u201d Spoke Tarik in flat reply. \u201cI\u2019m going with her\u201dThe witch doctor inspected the lumberjack for a moment as the young woman was being moved into the fort proper behind him. \u201cVery well, we may have need for you as it is.

Her mind felt hazy, and her limbs too heavy to move. The herbalist now seemed to meld in with all the other sounds that filled the air now.

Nine grimaced during the process of snapping the crossbow bolt, but otherwise there were no protests. Nine could feel the pain but she could not muster up the strength to scream now as she felt herself losing consciousness again, and desperately fought against it. She eventually picked out one sound piercing through the shouting of Tarik and the boy - a bell tolling in the distance; Her eyes drifted closed as she focused in on this one repetitive sound. She clung to this sound desperately as fear filled her heart - the ringing provided a small comfort as she thought simply,\u00a0<i>As long as I hear the bell, I am alive.<br/></i><br/>Distantly, through the cacophony of sound she heard the herbalist's voice,\u00a0<i>'Young lady, do you remember how you got shot?'\u00a0</i>\u00a0called the tiny voice.<br/><br/>\"They were trying to stop me...\" she began in a quiet and weak voice, taking a moment to take a breath before continuing, \"...Stop me from escaping.\" <br/><br/>These were all the words Nine had to offer as she clung to consciousness for a few more seconds before passing out once again shortly after finishing her sentence, it seemed her condition was getting worse.\u00a0<br/><br/><br/><div class=\"quote_clear\"></div></br></div></div>"}, "post-90710": {"user": "Nine", "user_num": 3394, "timestamp": "1559155058000", "message": "Nine's body remained limp as they transferred her over to the stretcher, her skin pallid and cold, her breathing faint.\u00a0In her unconsciousness, her mind wandered to various places.

They were coming to take her back now, they knew where she was now, the bolt would tell them.\u00a0The witch doctor was hard at work, mumbling to himself. The wounded girl had been placed on a gurney in the medical wing of the Fort, several meters underground. The room wasn\u2019t that large, holding only half a dozen beds within its space. Luckily no one else was injured, making the young woman the only occupant. Most of the equipment here was bought from the Isran Empire. Most of it out of date, bought for a low price. Saws, vices and other such tools of the trade were hanging from a nearby wall clean but well worn. Corvus did not even appear to notice these. Instead he was focused on reading through a small, ragged and barely stitched together book. Tarik was by the girls side and saw as the bolt began to glow. Although the rooms here were brightened by torch light, the faint green glow was unmistakable. \u201cThe bolts glowing!\u201d He exclaimed to the doctor, pointing. Corvus looked up from his book and saw the faint green glow of the bolt. \u201cThat won\u2019t do, that won\u2019t do at all.\u201d He said calmly, closing the book and placing it to one side. He turned to look at Tarik. \u201cI\u2019m going to need your help in this. She\u2019s lost too much blood and will die soon.\u201d \u201cWhat?!\u201d Tarik replied, shocked and surprised. \u201cI\u2019m going to need yours.\u201d Covus replied again calmly.Tarik\u2019s eyes widened, taken back by the request. \u201cI will not take part in your witching ways, you pathetic cretin!\u201d He said accusingly. \u201cYou wanted to help; this is how your going to do it. Now give me your hand!\u201d Corvus replied curtly. \u201cDo you want to save her or not?\u201dTarik looked down at the girl, who had once again gained consciousness. She looked so much like his daughter\u2026\u201cFine.\u201d He said, outstretching his arm. Corvus grabbed it quickly, dragging him over to the girl. Placing him on a nearby bed. Corvus kneeled in the gap between the two. He began to speak now, his words not in common tongue, instead he spoke in a language of full of harsh syllables and guttural tones. He was speaking the old tongue. Tarik realised, even his own grandparents only knew the odd phrase. Yet here he was speaking it like it was his first language! The witch doctor pulled out a small knife. It was amazingly ornate. The handle of carved bone, Tarik did not want to guess what animal. The blade long, sharp and etched with runes. He made a cut up on the girl\u2019s hand, deep and long. His chanting was getting faster now. He then cut both his own palms, again deep and long, blood seeping dark red from the wounds, mixing with the blood of the woman on the blade. The runes upon the blade were beginning to glow a bright orange glow now. He turned towards Tarik and dug his knife deep into his hand. Tarik yelled out in pain, trying to move his hand away. But the witch doctors grip was iron tight, not even the muscled axeman could move away. The chanting was even louder now, Corvus placed the blade upon the floor and firmly clasped both Tarik\u2019s and the woman\u2019s hand in each of his own. The dark red blood from their wounds mingling. That was when Tarik began to feel weak. He could feel the blood leaving him. Corvus was still chanting, now the same phrase over and over. Tarik looked over to the young woman. Her ashen face was beginning to gain colour again. What ever the doctor was doing, it was working. Tarik was getting even more weak now. His head began to droop, his mouth salivating, his stomach beginning to curl. Yet the doctor did not stop his chanting. If anything, he was getting louder, faster. Tarik\u2019s vision began to darken. He tried to speak, but his tongue would not leave his mouth. Sounds began to become muffled. Until all he could hear was the guttural sounds of Corvus as he drained him of blood and slowly, Tarik did not even hear that. His eye lids began to feel heavy and eventually closed and darkness embraced him.", "link_list": ["/post/90710/thread", "/user/3394"], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/oLuitO3.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@nine\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/90710/thread\" timestamp=\"1559155058\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-3394\" title=\"Nine\"><img alt=\"Nine Avatar\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/oLuitO3.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/90710/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1559155058000\" title=\"May 29, 2019 10:37:38 GMT -8\">May 29, 2019 10:37:38 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-3394 group-0\" href=\"/user/3394\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@nine\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Nine</span></a></span> said:</div>Nine's body remained limp as they transferred her over to the stretcher, her skin pallid and cold, her breathing faint.\u00a0<br><br/>In her unconsciousness, her mind wandered to various places.

Tarik\u2019s breathing begun to sound faint, his skin now a deathly white. \u201cAlmost there...\u201d Mumbled the doctor. The bolt slid free of nines shoulder and clanged to the rocky floor. No bloody wound could be seen where the bolt had been, only clean skin was seen beneath her tatted clothing. The doctor let out a gasp and let go of their hands, bending over in exhaustion. Taking a few deep breaths, he turned behind him to the collapsed lumber jack. He placed his trembling hands to Tarik\u2019s giant neck and paused. Then moved his hand over the slowly rising chest of the man and paused again, eventually letting out a low grunt. \u201cThat was close.

He patted the lumberjack on the chest. \u201cIf you had been a smaller man my boy. You would be dead.\u201d After a few seconds of deep breaths. Corvus got up from the floor, groaning as he used the bedding as support as he rose. He turned to observe the girl, inspecting her now. \u201cCome on girlie, help me put him on a gurney.\u201d He instructed, massaging his back. \u201cHe\u2019s going to wake up with one hell of an ache. \u201c", "link_list": ["/post/91040/thread", "/user/3394"], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/oLuitO3.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@nine\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/91040/thread\" timestamp=\"1559844755\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-3394\" title=\"Nine\"><img alt=\"Nine Avatar\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/oLuitO3.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/91040/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1559844755000\" title=\"Jun 6, 2019 10:12:35 GMT -8\">Jun 6, 2019 10:12:35 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-3394 group-0\" href=\"/user/3394\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@nine\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Nine</span></a></span> said:</div>Nine felt the blade slice across her hand, and she screamed, trying to pull away weakly.

She knelt next to him, though was unsure of what to do for a moment before the witch doctor instructed her to help him onto a gurney.\u00a0<br/><br/>She hooked both of her arms under one of the lumberjack's and with a grunt of effort began lifting the heavy man with the Witch Doctor onto a gurney.\u00a0<br/><br/>After some struggling the task was complete, and she turned to Corvus then, \"Thank you for healing me... but there's something that's worrying me...\"<br/><br/>She looked down at Tarik then, who was breathing faintly but steadily... perhaps that was worrying her too.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, she took out the bolt from her pocket then, <i>this was a more pressing matter -</i>\u00a0\"There's more to this bolt than meets the eye, I think the people who were trying to prevent my escape from The Garden might be able to track me down with this,\" she said, showing it to Corvus.<div class=\"quote_clear\"></div></br></div></div>"}, "post-91546": {"user": "Nine", "user_num": 3394, "timestamp": "1561102084000", "message": "Nine was quick in her answer, \"I'm going to destroy it, as soon as possible.\"She wanted nothing to do with the strange bolt, she only wanted it gone.

They pay quite well too.\u201d He winked at her. He turned and picked up the ritual knife off the floor, groaning as he bent over.

You gave the whole fort a scare when you came in saying you\u2019d been shot so close to the fort. Whole place is high strung as it is, what with the rumors of a counter attack filtering in. Kargth might even want to see you once he comes back from the relief mission.\u201d He finished cleaning his tool, and deftly sheathed the dagger. \u201cAbout that, that bolt.\u201d He nodded his head to the now ash pile on the floor. \u201cIs not something you see very often.

I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve been formally introduced. I am Corvus Moloreth.\u201d He gives a deep theatrical bow. \u201cI like to call myself a doctor. Some like our friend here. \u201cHe jerks his head in the direction of the sleeping giant. \u201cWould call me a witch. A title I do not like to use, but in some cases is apt as you probably saw before.\u201d As he was speaking, a young man not older then twenty sprinted into the small infirmary out of breath and grasping a large satchel bag full of medical supplies. \u201cWhere is she? I was told there was a girl shot by a bolt in the chest?\u201d He said between gasps. \u201cI ran ahead of the convoy as fast as I could.\u201d Corvus smirked and gave a small laugh. \u201cThis would be her my boy. Right as rain.\u201d The young doctor reached out to a nearby wall to steady himself between gasps of breath. \u201cCan\u2019t be, she was close to death. I was told so by the guards outside, left most of her blood on the wagon they told me.\u201d\u201cIndeed she did.\u201d Corvus said gravely. Turning to Nine once more. \u201cAnother minute and she would have died. Remind me to thank Lorien before she leaves.\u201d He turned back to the gasping doctor at the door, who was now starting to regain his strength. \u201cOur friend here though, does need your attention.\u201d He pointed at the resting Tarik. \u201cLost a lot of blood in a transfer. He\u2019s stable but he\u2019s going to be as weak as a small child when he wakes in a few hours.\u201d \u201cTransfer?\u201d The doctor said taking a final deep breath and walked past Corvus and Nine and to the sleeping man. \u201cWhat do you mean trans..\u201d Once closer, the doctor could see the slice mark on the sleeping man\u2019s hand. \u201cIs that?!\u201d he said in a mixture of surprise and indignation. He rounded on Corvus. \u201cYou\u2019re Corvus aren\u2019t you! You used your damn blood magic on him!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s alive, isn\u2019t he? The girl is fine too no thanks to you.\u201d Covrus responded, dryly. \u201cGet the hell out of my infirmary.\u201d Yelled the doctor. Point at the door angrily. \u201cTake the girl with you if she\u2019s so healthy. Kargth will want to speak to both of you. He\u2019s only an hour behind me.\u201d The witch doctor lightly grabbed the young womans arm and gently moving her towards the door. \u201cWe best get out of here my lady. Get you into some new clothes.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to write an official complaint about you Corvus. You\u2019ve gone too far!\u201d Spoke the doctor as they left the room.Corvus shook his head as he left the room, sighing to himself. \u201cAs you might have realised. I\u2019m sort of the man of last resort in these places.\u201d Corvus said as he guided her through the tunnels beneath the keep. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t think less of me my dear.\u201d", "link_list": ["/post/91666/thread", "/user/3394"], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/oLuitO3.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@nine\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/91666/thread\" timestamp=\"1561412756\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-3394\" title=\"Nine\"><img alt=\"Nine Avatar\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/oLuitO3.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/91666/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1561412756000\" title=\"Jun 24, 2019 13:45:56 GMT -8\">Jun 24, 2019 13:45:56 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-3394 group-0\" href=\"/user/3394\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@nine\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Nine</span></a></span> said:</div>The longer Nine was awake, the more she felt out of her depth, and the more nervous she was.

Wood crates were stacked haphazardly inside, with hash sacks piled on top. \u201cIts best you hear it from me first rather then when you see him.\u201d Corvus whispered, bending low to her head height, groaning as he did so. \u201cKargth is not human, not anymore. I don\u2019t understand much about it and I\u2019ve not had much face to face with him, but most in the militia know. Its kind of an open secret. He was found here.

What other things could be accomplished through the use of magic?Nine felt a bit worried about meeting Kargth now.\u00a0\"Not human?\" she echoed, a chill running down her spine. Her mind raced, what if he didn't like what she had to say? Kargth was probably looking for information, of which she didn't have much to offer. He was probably expecting her to tell him about her captors... but she didn't know much about them. She didn't even know where The Garden even was exactly from here, one second she grabbed that metal orb and the next she was in that strange forest.Corvus tilted his head at the girl, seeing the fear and apphrension play across her young face. \u201cJust because he isn\u2019t human, doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t care.\u201d He said, trying to comfort her. \u201cHe\u2019s more human then many people I have had the misfortune to know. You have nothing to fear. Now come, lets get you out of those clothes.\u201d He directed her out of the small storage room and back into the tunnels. \u201cThis place is quite easy to navigate once you understand the layout.\u201d Corvus said as they were coming close to the requisition office. \u201cThink of it as a tower. From what I understand its layout is very similar to one, just underground. We haven\u2019t had the manpower to explore the lower levels, but it seems to increase in size the deeper you go. Most of the rooms were empty, so they were repurposed as we went. It\u2019s a bit strange actually, its built as if it was a tower first, and then placed underground.\u201d \u201cHere we are.\u201d Corvus said as he reached a large archway with two guards outside directing and watching the flow of traffic enter and leaving. As they entered the gentle flow of people entering they were met with a scene of controlled chaos. The room itself seemed to have been some sort of function room originally. With a high ceiling and large space. The floor was an ornate combination of smoothed granite and stones, laid out in strange circles and spiral patterns. Now it served as a centre of storage. What was immediately seen were great shelves that had been placed in neat rows along the back walls, forming a maze of corridors. Each shelf three meters high and packed with crates and barrels. In front of these storage shelves where several independent counters and benches, each with separate queues. As a person reached the counter, handing over either papers, money or items the clerk would write down their name, time and item requested and send a small child into the maze. Who after ten or so minutes would reappear with either clothing, rope, utensils, maps or even great backpacks full of camping equipment. \u201cThis may take a while to get to the front.\u201d Corvus said, observing the length of the queues. \u201cNow is the perfect time to discuss what you\u2019ll say to Kargth when he arrives. Make a good impression and all that.\u201d He inspected the several lines and directed her towards the shortest one. \u201cNow, tell me everything in as much detail as possible and that you\u2019re comfortable with telling. Especially on how you came to be here.", "link_list": ["/post/91870/thread", "/user/3394"], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/oLuitO3.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@nine\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/91870/thread\" timestamp=\"1561872833\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-3394\" title=\"Nine\"><img alt=\"Nine Avatar\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/oLuitO3.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/91870/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1561872833000\" title=\"Jun 29, 2019 21:33:53 GMT -8\">Jun 29, 2019 21:33:53 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-3394 group-0\" href=\"/user/3394\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@nine\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Nine</span></a></span> said:</div>Nine's eyebrows raised higher and higher as Corvus explained who Kargth was, as well as his unique... situation.

You haven\u2019t told me where you\u2019re actually from, or who you were with. The last thing Kargth wants is to make enemies with another faction without knowing it.
