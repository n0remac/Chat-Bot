After just a moments hesitation, stemming from have to assess the sheer ridiculousness of the situation, they fired their magic.They pointed their ornate spears at the approaching insects and birds, the air around crackling with magic, arcs of orange energy traveling across their armor. The energy traveled from their bodies and down the length of the polearm, causing it to glow brightly within their grasp. The magic focused upon a point just beyond the tip and an orb of energy came into existence and grew in power, so intense that it appeared that multiple miniature \"suns\" had just appeared. The magical energies that filled the Valkyrie coalesced into these shrunken stars, and the moments before they were fired seem to extend for almost an eternity.However the spheres of power were not meant to be admired, rather they were meant to bring death upon those who opposed \u00cdskaldur. So they were fired, A deep tone filling the air as they flew towards the approaching waves of insects and birds. Upon contact they burst into flames, incinerating the creatures at point blank range and burning a considerable amount more to death. The horrid smell of burnt flesh filled the air and the charred corpses of various creatures littered the ground just ahead of the army. But even that couldn't completely annihilate the swarms of insects and creatures and what could still be considered a rather large swarm hit the ranks of the army of \u00cdskaldur.The vast majority of the army was thrown into a disarray as they attempted to fight off the swarm. Vikings flayed their arms in hopes of smashing the persistently annoying insects, and many accidents happened. Men fell upon one another and many injuries occurred as the they instinctively swung their weapons to hit the minuscule foe. Only the Mineraali and Valkyries could be considered unaffected having no need to fear the insects or birds, their largest concern being staying somewhat clean which had been abandoned as soon as the surviving birds ran their bombing runs, dropping feces upon those below. But all in all, this had been quite successful, and \u00cdskaldur would have to stay ready for such underhanded techniques from the druids in the future. The druid had indeed gained the right to blow the raspberry, and no one in the army was in much of a state to tell them to stop.ArridiaNow if only the follow up attack had been as successful. Indeed the Riders of Aridia slammed into the rear flank of the chaotic army, but they had underestimated one aspect of \u00cdskaldur's formation, that being how they had carefully guarded their invaluable healers. With only six healers present it wasn't hard at all to position a couple Mineraali guards around them, and to think they wouldn't had been a grave mistake on the Aridian side. Sure the Druid's swarm had disoriented the army, but what reason did giant beasts of crystal guarding the healers have to care about such puny bugs? When one considered all the other Mineraali who had been position within the ranks of the Archer, it was obvious how large of a mistake they had made.So as one Aridian rider was mowing through the archers, heading to the targeted healer, they would no doubt be surprised when a enormous fist of crystal sudden filled their vision. A large crack would be heard as it made contact, armor collapsing and bone being pulverized. This sickening sound would repeat again, and again, and again, as the Mineraali engaged the riders, blocking the rider's path and outnumbering them by at least fifty.Once the Aridians attempted to flee they would find no trouble from the Mineraali, as they were far to slow to keep up with the speed of the desert horses. However their attempt to slaughter the healers had been quite far from successful, only slaying one while his guards had been otherwise occupied. The remaining five quickly went to work to resurrect the many fallen archers, Mineraali standing in a ring around them as they worked their magic.", "link_list": ["/user/1532", "/user/3014"], "image_list": [], "html": "<div><span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-1532 group-0\" href=\"/user/1532\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@dumbdruid\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Huata of the Dittany</span></a></span><br/></div>"}, "post-83325": {"user": "Ingrid", "user_num": 3059, "timestamp": "1528597841000", "message": "Ingrid swings her axe forward, before raising it towards the sky.

It slowly rises to its full height, raising a single hand into the sky. A terrible blue glow, still shining from the being's hand (as it has been for a long time now) now brightens, becoming a blinding flame of horrible, ancient power.

They hang there in space, suspended by invisible wires, not so much as a pebble falling onto the Iskaldurian army.

Aylith smiles to itself.Aylith's fingers form into a little finger \"gun\" of sorts, as the creature theatrically \"shoots\" at the golem. \"I think you....\"\"...should go away.\"Immediately, the falling rocks, now frozen in space, turn. In unison they all began flying toward and bombarding the earth titan with incredible speed, too fast to be absorbed by it.

He took a moment to look away from the cliff face and survey the empty desert around them. It was relieving that there was no apparent threat at the moment. This plan effectively split their forces in two, with the segment on the ground losing power as they went to join those atop the cliff face.He admitted it was dangerous, but it was a danger he was willing to take to avoid the canyon. It was obviously a set up for something bad, although he did not know what exactly what the bad thing was. He had some ideas as to what might be there. Perhaps the enemy army waiting on the other side, or some hidden trap in the valley that could escape even magic detection.However what he imagined was quite different than the truth.He couldn't prepare for the explosion that rang through the canyon, collapsing a significant amount of the cliff walls and burying the incinerated dung. He then watched the ground churn and out of it came a enormous giant of stone, who brought his large fist down upon the men climbing the ladder.

Many knew that they could do nothing against the behemoth, their weapons mere twigs when compared to the titan. It was up to the valkyries and the other elite magic casters within their ranks to deal with it, and that they did.A cheer began to erupt as the monstrosity began to fall, but it didn't last long as they saw the golem beginning to make its final attacks. The first arm soared through the air towards the cliff top. The few berserkers who had made it up there before the initial attack dove out of the way, yet that was only so effective. A little over half of them were crushed, their entrails being smeared across the ground as the arm dragged itself off the rock, taking with it a handful of troops into the inescapable quicksand. The others that were crushed either were killed instantly, or if one weren't so lucky they would lay moaning in pain, half crushed and waiting for death to come.The arm that flew towards Einhver, Kirith, and Amaya would not be intercepted by any of the \u00cdskaldurian forces, as they would soon be busy with problems of their own.The collision between the remaining body of the golem and the cliff walls would cause a resounding crack to travel through the air. Several more of the chunks of cliff would break and fall off, and although it was considerably less than the first time it didn't mean that it wasn't any less deadly. They fell upon the forces of \u00cdskaldur, crushing a considerable amount of the vikings and a good number of Mineraali, as well as finding their mark upon five of the six healers. The surviving Mineraali guard would instantly begin attempting to lift the crushing rock off the healer, yet it appeared that one was simply too large to be moved at the moment.Finally the last and possibly most devastating from the collapsing titan was the shrapnel. This mowed through the nearest ground troops, killing many and harming more. Luckily after the first couple of rows the damage was minimized, the dead bodies of their comrades and the still standing mineraali acting as effective impromptu shields for the rest of the force. The valkyries hovering above took quite the beating from the Shrapnel, arguably worse than any of the others. However they were resilient, and despite their armor receiving more than a few dents and scratches, as well as a handful of holes, they were more or less fine and could continue fighting if there was the need.But the immediate threat was gone, and a healer still remained. The troops changed their formation to accommodate the decrease in numbers, still keeping a defensive formation around the bodies of their allies while the Healer worked it's magic.

The place where her blood had spilled was the epicenter of the quake as the earth began to slowly split apart as Amaya slowly began to move to sit up. <br/><br/>\"My father below me, send me protection against these wretched Reapers of Light.\" She prayed and the crack gradually grew larger in the ground as the earth quake continued. Amaya smirked as she spat out her blood on the ground looking up a Kirith still aloft as cry much like that of furious dragon exploded from the ground. <div class=\"quote_clear\"></div></br></div></div>"}, "post-83518": {"user": "Varden, The Grand Warden", "user_num": 2907, "timestamp": "1528945310000", "message": "Varden raises his hands, trying to decide in a split second whether to maintain the  quicksand, or try and mitigate the damage of the new threat fallen from the sky.
