It was a bit big for a falcon.The guards were mostly at ease. They sensed only a bit of tension from Atma, but that was to be expected; if the crowd was any indication these people were not used to outsiders. And priests were typically rather busy people. They dismounted, carefully leading their animals through the crowds. Speaking of which, these beasts would probably be a bit more familiar. They were a breed of tamed wildebeests, a bit like bulls, but leaner and striped, bearded and with ridges of hair on their backs.

Please inform him that the Sheikh requests his presence at the palace, and invites any of his party as the head outlander sees fit.\u201dAtma was sure Huata or at least some of his party would have questions, and as they collected around her she turned and began walking in hopes that she wouldn\u2019t have to answer many of them. She led the outlanders in a direction that appeared to be tangentially away from the city, which would seem strange until they came to a narrow pass in the cliffs that surrounded the city. Once through the pass, they would see that the small village that they\u2019d come through in their caravan was only part of the tribe\u2019s home, as a long and winding path down through yet more cliffside into a large ravine held the remainder of it, including the palace.Huts and housing partially set into the cliffside jutted out from the rockface, and rope bridges ran across from one side of the ravine to the other at varying heights above the stone floor below. As they descended, the outlanders would undoubtedly notice a marked decrease in temperature as the stone was much cooler than the hot sand above, and the sun would only directly enter the ravine for a short time every day.Once the party had reached the bottom, they would find themselves at a large set of wooden doors with ornate carving in them - obviously the entrance to the Sheikh\u2019s palace. The doors were opened for them, and Atma led the outlanders and her contingent into a foyer. The room was lined with tables on either side, and much of the same exotic fruits and delicacies the group had seen being carried about in the village were laid out on wooden or hand-blown glass platters on the tables.\u201cPlease remain here, I will tell the Sheikh of your arrival. Our Sheikh has ordered these refreshments prepared for you. There are people here to see to any other needs you may have.\u201d Atma continued her pattern of being right to the point with the outlanders. She was bound to carry out the Sheikh's wishes concerning the outlanders, but nowhere did it say she had to be friendly towards them.With a slight nod of her head, the accompanying priestess came to Atma, who handed to the younger girl her skulled staff. Atma pushed her hood back off of her head, and then pulled the robe back on her shoulders before pulling it off completely. She handed the robe to a servant who came to take it from her, and took her staff back from the young priestess.

In your sands there are but a few thousand counts of consciousness above animals and pets, in the grand world far off there are people in the millions living longer, wiser lives. In two souls there is more than in one, in any culture and land I find that greater than myself, and in more human souls I find more greatness than in the spirits of a handful desert dwellers - Holy desert or not.

Then with a snarl he drove a sharp mailed index finger across his right cheek and extended it, a single drop welling at the front and hanging off. \"You want faith? So be it. In no idol is my faith; my blood, my flesh. This drop, it shall not fall. My path is the truth, my path is right. All will align for it, fate itself will oblige. Use your witch-thoughts, sense there is naught arcane here. But I don't believe, I know it shall not fall. Winds may go upon it and in spite you may blow or use sorcery but with me it will remain. I need no desert for faith, I only need ultimate truth. But, I leave the future ever open for my faith, my will, it is greater than fate and it will change.

One of their first positive impressions was the way that the locals created homes in the rock face itself. This was an admirable and efficient use of nature to them. They refrained from asking too many questions as they traveled, since Atma seemed reticent. But they did make a few comments. \"Our compliments on how you've learned to live in harmony with the desert. This is a trait our people hold in high esteem.\" One of the elves said.\"Also I like your clothing.\" A human added.Huata periodically whispered to his falcon (which during their trek was revealed to be named Beaver), and astonishingly the falcon seemed to reply in distinctive chirps and clicks. \"Many young druids learn to speak with animals at a young age.\" The same elf explained.When they arrived at the palace's foyer, they bowed gratefully and partook of the bounty given to them as Atma left.When the Sheikh arrived, he'd find them calmly enjoying their meals.

We brought some goods for you and your people to examine if you wish. They are mostly back at our caravan, but I have some samples with me.\" She had with her several pouches. One contained semiprecious stones like hematite, turquoise, quartz, and various other crystals. The most valuable object appeared to be a small fossil, set in its stone, encase in a glass sphere. Another contained various vials of herbs and medicines. Yet a third contained dried fruit not native to the desert at all.Huata raised his head up. \"I have a strange question to ask. This food we're eating. Is it ok if we keep the seeds? I'm here not just as an ambassador, but as a representative of a group in my land called the Druidic Enclave. We are here on a... what's that word...\" Beaver made an odd click. \"Oh, right, scholarly, yah that's it, scholarly capacity. We want to learn about how you live in the desert, and if it was necessary, assist in any way we can. Our goal is to help various peoples live in harmony with their lands. Not that we'd presume to do so in your case. I think you have much more to teach us about living in the desert than vice versa.\"Beaver flapped his wings.\"Oh, right.

He was sitting when another man entered the room wearing a green tunic and tall, tan riding boots. He was much younger than the wizard, with his light brown hair shaved on the sides of his head and a thick mustache styled to points resting on his upper lip.

The rigid discipline and drilling that these men underwent ensured they maintained a close, phalanx-like formation.

These were mercenaries wearing light gambesons and kettle helmets, wielding armor-piercing Vessian crossbows.Sibrand was able to muster two-hundred ten cavalry for the battle.  Ten of those men were Knight-Brothers, while the remaining two-hundred were supporting Halbruders.  They were deployed to the right of the Order\u2019s infantry.Finally, Sibrand\u2019s engineers were assembling a single trebuchet, while his five Clergymen were spreading themselves throughout the entire army, preparing to cast defensive ward spells.Sibrand would retreat to the rear of his force, alongside his drummers, buglers, and flagbearers.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "As the army of Iskaldur closed on the town of Aridia, a relief force sent by the Vorutans arrived.
