Homage to the elders is mandatory and disrespect is met with an early death. They cover themselves head to toe in the flesh, hides, and bones of beasts they have slain, believing that this will give them attributes of that beast. Their tribe is nestled in the Western craigs of the mountainside, using the cover of the rocky shadows to keep cool from the sun.Chieftain Orva of Zhura:Orva is one of the oldest female orcs in Duradin. She has been around for many wars and conflict, using her wisdom to guide the tribe to safely traverse the sands of time. Her goal is not to gain control of the other territories, but to maintain the balance and order of all six tribes.Zhura, the Tribe of Shamans, was infiltrated and stolen from and they need you to retrieve the stolen artifact and return it.A vulture circles above you, although you are not dead nor reek of near death. It carries something in its talon, and as you peer up to view it, the object is dropped. You move out of the way, not wanting to be splattered by the bird's leftovers, only to see a scroll unfurl and flutter towards the ground. It lies face up on the dirt, a series of runes (Orcish) scrawled neatly on it.If you have the capability to read Orcish, the runes translate to:A thief has struck, stolen our sacred statuette of Movaar the Wise in the night. The coward fled the mountains, out into deserts beyond our borders where we can not follow. We of the Zhura tribe need it returned. May you be of great honor and return our artifact. -Chieftain OrvaBy the time you finish looking at the parchment, the vulture has disappeared, leaving you with a choice; to accept the quest or continue on your way.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/6HmHPcT.jpg"], "html": "<b><font size=\"4\">Zhura, Tribe of Shamans</font></b>"}}
