I knew you had a passion against magic, cousin, but I had never realized it ran this far. He went to examine the various pieces of loot in the collection, handling demons' skulls, talismans, staves, goblets, and idols. Altameir took a rib from a small dragon's skeleton and attempted to offer it to Fenrig, but the wolf denied the gift, knowing better than to chew on Smertas's trophy. He placed it back on the skeleton. After some more minutes of searching, he came across a carefully-folded flag resting on a shelf, trying to remain inconscpicuous. Unfolding the flag, Altameir discovered that it bore the colors of House Dra\u00edochta. Smertas must have taken it down for some reason... Altameir draped the flag over some other trophies and moved on.Entering the east wing, Altameir examined the servants' quarters, only to find them barren, with only the most meager furniture carefully placed in each room. A large portion of the section had even collapsed into the dungeons below, depicting an eerie allegory: living area cumbling and falling into a place of torture and death.The east wing also bore a washroom, which was entire devoid of furnishing; pantry, which was far from well-stocked but not empty; and kitchens, which appeared unused for many months. Despite the disuse, everything was organized and in order. How like Smertas.The west wing contained a large dining hall, with a banquet table. All the dishes and silverware were laid out on the table, as if Smertas had been expecting fifty-nine visitors.Smertas's own bedroom was, as expected, excellently furnished, likely from the ornate furnishings of those mages and other rich men who employed magic's services. This was at least not true of Smertas's large bed, which bore the arms of House Dra\u00edochta on the headboard: two swords crossed below a black sallet on red and white checkered field. On the front of the footboard were the specific arms of Smertas, which bore House Dra\u00edochta's foreground above a black and white eagle clutching a blue orb of magical energy.Leading from Smertas's bedroom was a long hall of portraits and other paintings, some from the Dra\u00edochta collection, most looted. At the hall's end opened another large room, bearing Smertas's more private and prized trophies: the complete and preserved body of a large dragon dominated the room, multiple human and elf bodies were laid to rest within glass-lidded coffins, the twisted and broken remains of Artificed constructs were on display on the floor, many powerful and broken staves were mounted on the walls, and on the far wall was mounted the head of a giant dragon.\"Incredible...\" breathed Altameir. \"Incredible, yet terrible.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Altameir stood in the doorway to the main trophy room, mouth agape.

She wasn't accustomed to carrying two fully-armored passengers, as each labored beat of her wings attested. The knight, who had removed his helm earlier, peered off into the distance unhindered. A decrepit tower poked out on the horizon, no more than a grey smudge to his eyes. Edyrian patted the griffin on the shoulder with one gauntleted hand. \"We're almost to our resting place for the night. Just a little further.\" He was met with a rumbling trill. Taking that as acknowledgement, Edyrian shifted his position to lean over the side. The passenger was obscured from his sight by the bulk of the griffin, but surely she was still there. He raised his voice in order to be heard over the rushing air. \"We'll be landing in a few minutes!\"He righted himself, wincing in anticipation of yet another verbal assault. The knight was fully aware of how rude it had been to leave her dangling from the griffin's claws throughout the journey, but it had seemed the best choice. She would have gotten herself killed had he left her to her own devices, and giving her a seat behind him was begging for a dagger in the neck. It would be much better to deal with her on the ground, where the massive avian creature would be able to assist.The tower rapidly grew, revealing itself to be a single portion of a larger castle. The griffin extended her wings when the distance had closed sufficiently, gliding in a soft descent. She broke into a fit of furious flapping just over the intended landing point, bringing herself to a standstill. The warrior in her claws was released a moment before the beast landed with a surprisingly soft thud. Her rider climbed off with a quiet groan. Extended flying tended to leave him quite sore. Edyrian immediately unstrapped his spear from the griffin's side. The young woman seemed quite volatile, and he'd prefer to be able to defend himself should the following conversation turn sour. \"Welcome to our temporary campsite!
