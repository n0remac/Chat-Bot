One, two-\"On two, he slid the diabolical instrument into the corner of Regal's eye socket. Strangely enough, the excruciating pain that Regal had anticipated was noticeably absent. In its place was the extremely unpleasant feeling of the man's instrument sliding past his eyeball. Once it reached the back of his eye, there was a sharp sting as the nerve was severed. Regal would see a sudden flash of light out of his right eye, then nothing. There was a sickening pop, the man stepped back. If he opened his remaining eye, he'd see the salesman standing in front of him, holding his eye by the nerve and inspecting it with a magnifying glass. He looked back up at Regal, and patted him on the head.\"There we go, that wasn't too bad, was it? Here, I'll even throw in a free eye patch.
