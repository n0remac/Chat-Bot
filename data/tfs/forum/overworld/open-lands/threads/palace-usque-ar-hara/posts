What I do know is that, not only does the tablet hold hierarchical significance for the raising of a new queen, it is likely THRUMMING with endless mana like much of the aged spectacles within the Usque. There is so much ancient magic that flows through this land like unseen water, and the older the more powerful - if not also the more dangerous. So the tablet is extremely important, and I can only hope than in it's absence it has NOT seen it's way into devious hands of any sort - and in all likelihood the very trees hid it as to avoid it leaving to become a tool in the hands of an imbecile from beyond here.\"She finally stopped to take a breath, and a rather deep one as her lungs screamed at her for the babble. \"Again, apologies.

Wow, that's really cool.\"Having spent most of her life barely literate, Mina tried not to let her insecurity show through her smile.\"Well, if the tablet radiates lots of mana, I guess we'll need some kind of mana detector. Are the sources of mana mapped out in the Usque? Could we somehow tell the difference between what's supposed to be there and what isn't? Umm, we might also need someone who's good at tracking, so we can tie people's movement to unnatural sources of mana.\"Mina was suddenly surprised at herself. She felt like she was asking all the right questions, almost as if she was a competent human being.The invisible presence which watched over Mina took an interest in Gaelira's asymmetries, both physical and gear-like. If Gaelira could sense it, she'd feel it was humanoid shaped and floating to the side, forming a triangle between the three. The presence would seem especially interested in Gaelira's gauntlet. It swayed back and forth like an inquisitive animal, observing the artifact from different angles. In fact, the vibe coming from the entity would be precisely that of a curious guard dog, though the presence would seem of a higher order of intelligence than a canine.Of course, this was meaningless if Gaelira couldn't sense its behavior.
