Wild animals rely on its freshwater, as do the great oaks anchored by deep roots.  There are waterfalls and rapids along its length, bends and curves, and points where it branches off into smaller rivers, streams, and creeks.Its greatest obstacle is Hilltop.  The earth rises at a gradual elevation into a flat-topped mound.  The river is forced to accept the dominance of the hill, and so is forced to flow around its eastern base in a great crescent before continuing its journey southward.Hilltop may be overgrown with shrubbery and small gatherings of trees, but it is also the site of a future settlement.  The location, with its natural moat on one side, access to freshwater, fish, wild game, thick woodland, and elevated terrain, is a prime location for any would-be pioneers.PopulationKaemo Oraeto Terde  - Hunter/Gatherer - Collects food for the settlement.Roan  - Lumberjack/Woodcutter - Collects lumber to help build, and chops firewood for survival.[Pending (Squid)] - Tanner/Clothier/Tailor - Fashions pelts and other items into clothes for the settlement.[Pending (Meep)]", "link_list": ["/user/3572", "/user/3573"], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/IF9mrjg.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><b><font size=\"4\">Hilltop</font></b></div>"}, "post-93094": {"user": "Roan", "user_num": 3573, "timestamp": "1566647972000", "message": "As the caravan of pioneers and settlers reaches the northern base of a great mound, Roan rejoiced at the prospect of having finally reached their destination.  They were given little information on the exact whereabouts of the area, but were told to follow the river southward, and so they trekked through the thick forest for many days.Picking up his pace, the stout fellow proceeded to climb the gentle slope of the mound's northern face.  The river had cut to their left, following the hill's eastern base like a moat around a grand fortress.  There were many bushes, shrubs, and small trees dotting the top of the hill, but these would be easily removed in time.  It was certainly the plot of land known as Hilltop!\"We have reached our destination, my friends,\" Roan called back to the group.  He would assist in bringing what little supplies and belongings everyone had and situated them at the central point of the mound.Fortunately, the weather was amicable, and the temperature was mild, and there were no clouds around to indicate a coming storm.  It would be a good time, Roan thought, to build temporary shelters.  The lumberjack chose a spot on Hilltop's eastern side, where the river's bank hugged its base.Roan gathered three strong branches and brought them to his spot, using his woodcutters axe when necessary.  Two of the branches, with tops that symbolized the letter 'Y', were drove into the ground, and the third branch was laid across them, sitting in the cradle of each 'Y'.  A series of other, smaller branches were then laid diagonally with one end on the ground and the other resting on the third branch.  A simple, primitive lean-to shelter was his objective.  Ferns, shrubs, grasses, and other vegetation were then laid across this makeshift abode as a sort of roof.When this was finished, Roan would loan his services to whoever asked for them, offering his axe and strength to his friend.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "As the caravan of pioneers and settlers reaches the northern base of a great mound, Roan rejoiced at the prospect of having finally reached their destination.
