Myralthrine felt this the instant the tower appeared in the distance, the gentle lull of its calling bringing her ever closer for rumor and want and need seemed to coincide in the monstrous contraption carved in a time long forgotten. Malevolent now, her memory served to remind her the towers had been a place of peace and prosperity for those seeking knowledge long ago. Twisted interiors and cursed passageways were a new addition, one she was blissfully unaware of as she approached the spire. As she neared the silence surprised her. No animals dared venture as close as she, a peculiar sign but one made clearer by her listening to the whispers of the world around her. Dark magic, old magic, fearful they were, wanting they were not. Turn back, they urged soft voices on the edge of her mind, and yet she persisted. No answers were to be found in the kindly places of the world, no rumors still existed of the things she sought and therefore she found it necessary to go somewhere more timeless.

Leather bracers in the same dark leather as her boots and belt graced her forearms. They were brought together with thong and fit nicely along her forearms.

Asking what the tower would take if all were freely given. \u201c It paused again. \u201c I have little sway over what you would give, any more than you have already given that is, but prices are seldom so clearly printed for things in the tower.

That it had some knowledge on what she sought but not what part, not where she could find it, for it spoke in riddles. \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d It slipped from her mouth before she could stop it, \u201cThis place was spoke of in such reverence, as a great place but now it feels as if there is illness within you.\u201d(DOne)\u201cSilence. \u201c The voice sounded tired\u2026 \u201c Firstly.

It had not been forbidden once or odd to see a couple of a Drow and an Elf where as now it would be. She had a sweet sorrow to the way she sang unaware that in due time she would be subject to the sadness of the splitting of their races, of the disappearance of the stone, for soon enough she would find herself falling for an Elf who spoke too much  and never be allowed to follow that very dream that haunted her.

Entering with soft step she barely made a sound as she glanced at the doorways that were offered to her. Each one held next to it a pillar with some sort of decoration. Looking for a pattern she wondered if the hallways were in some way related to the subjects outside of them. The obelisk that spanned upward was the center piece that drew her attention. Unable to pass beyond the hall without observing it she found herself drawn its direction merely from curiosity. Provisions in her pack and a sense of adventure and weariness she was in no hurry to make a hasty decision and after having met Kelly she believed it was perhaps the downfall of the man himself. Glancing back that way she thought she heard just the faintest humming. A coy smile reached her lips and she approached the Obelisk itself. Bending down before it she observed what was laid at the bottom? Offerings? Should she also offer something to the Tower. Gently picking up the arrow with the ribbon around it she touched the fletching in order to ascertain its origin. Most races and people had certain feathers they used and techniques. If nothing was ascertained from it she gave a look to the books themselves. Each would have different titles and each might have different eras in which they were written. Rising after giving them all some thought she once again swung down her pack, very little from home had accompanied her. Withdrawing a single flower, of which she had two, she would hold it before her hands almost trembling. One had been to remember her home by and the second had been to lay at the alter in which she found the stone. An offering then of a world long forgotten by the man who had so quickly disappeared with it. The flower itself was a rather odd hybrid of something resembling a rose that was bright blue in color. \"This is Ismeros, known as the Water Star among my people,\" she spoke aloud to the Obelisk aware it may not hear her but the eyes that watched might be curious to her actions, \"It is preserved until it is planted again and from there it shall bloom and drop seeds and spark life. It will bloom brighter when replanted for it thrives upon being given new life. It is a symbol of the Drow homeland and it is planted nowhere beyond its borders to my own knowledge. I offer it now as a sign or reverence and to increase the knowledge of the Tower itself.\" Places it gently across the other offerings she stood straight and touched the Obelisk itself.

The feathers were a bird she'd never encountered. Bright blue feathers with fine plumage trimmed into narrow vanes. The feathers were bound with red braided thread rather than glued, the knock was made from brass. The arrowhead was hammered black iron shaped like a broad head, four barbs were placed on every 90 degrees of the head. A wound from this would not be easy to threat at the very least... The presences seemed to be watching our Drow did not care one way or the other as to what she had to say, it simply watched on as she went about her task. The books ranged from cheaply made tombs with wooden covers to finely crafted leather bound editions. All of the books were written in languages that were unreadable, some had no title and resembled journals. Some were storybooks it seemed if the illustrations meant anything. The condition of the paper varied as much as what had been used in making them, some felt as frail as dried rice paper, others closer to woven cotton. The offering to the monument did not cause any stir, but as she bent down to place the gift, she'd notice the plaque that had been hidden by the stack of books. The gentle chill trailed up her arms once more as the letters danced before her eyes. \" A Monument to the Fallen, May the all mother kiss their sleeping eyes.\" Touching the monument also did not produce any noticeable effect--- though as she gazed upwards, she would notice the embers once more--- They were not embers at all.Floating above her head rising to the unseen ceiling were names--- Hundreds of them---- All of them written in a warm gold light dancing away from her...

Glancing upward to the names she wondered if these were still remembered, if anyone truly spared a thought for Kelly Farcastar as well. A man forgotten by time and trapped within the Tower itself. His guidance might save her from whatever fate befell her in here. Reading the names with her eyes instead of her lips she remained for a few moments, how long she would never know looking from one to the other watching as they flitted about.

No passing glance would settle the unease of simply choosing one so therefore she moved to each one independently.

Searching one for further answers there was no place for a key and they were built solid. Breaking one down would be but a shove in the right location with her foot. Considering it she was already halfway in the motion of putting her foot beside the handle itself and descending with the force of her weight. Then she heard the voices. They rattled on with strength and with judgement for even if the tongue was foreign to her the tone was surely not. Understanding not all was what it seemed in regards to the machinations of the Tower itself she set her torch in one of the empty brackets. Being Drow she had the ability to see in perfect darkness the pitch only a minor nuisance to her pupils which widened outward. Taking the fire itself had only been to ward away the chill of the area but as it rolled over her in a wave she figured that no false spells or warding would protect her and therefore she would leave behind the slight hope of a child and settle for the smooth feel of leather in the palm of her hand. The Morningstar was a better choice than the torch in her opinion for the moment. Creeping forward the laughter flowed through her and she straightened. She would not be cowed by fear, could not, and therefore she stepped forth into the light allowing her eyes to adjust until she could see the scene before her.

She swallowed thickly, staring at it for a long while till the shadow of the structure drifted over to cover the right side of her face. Then, without another moment wasted, she scarfed down the rest of her lunch and took up her staff that had been resting against the boulder. She hopped off the moss covered stone and hurried to the building. Whatever it was, she had to investigate it. Both for the health of the forest and to satisfy her own curiosity. The dread only continued to grow the closer she came to the Tower, but she stifled it down. Nothing was ever learned from cowardice. As she neared though, she became aware of the heavy trod of steps nearby and she faltered a bit before she stopped and looked around until she laid eyes on the small form of the fae determinedly trudging to the tower.

Aside from the heavy piles of tombs, books and other reading material there were glass display case, some smashed open and empty, others not.\u00a0 Fragments of a stone tablet were housed in a glass box hidden in the far side of the room , just passed the towering book shelves.\u00a0 The fragmented slab was only about the size of her palm , but had several small markings on it.\u00a0 A bronze plaque was sitting next to it.\u00a0 There were other things in dirty glass displays as well, maps of lands Myraltrhine had never seen,\u00a0 preserved plants, and a head dress made from golden feathers...There was no sense of magic from any of these items however.in the four corners of the room were writing desk, complete with reams of paper, quills, ink and setting sand even, though many of the jars seemed missing or empty.\u00a0There was likely more hidden within the room than her brief scouting could reveal hidden among the rows of shelves and displays.\u00a0On the ends of each and every row of storage Myraltrhine would notice a small rack, not much larger than a picture frame in size or depth. It wouldn't have been able to store a book save for one maybe leaned facing outwards--- but\u00a0 there were rows of hangers sitting empty---Save for one. A single pair of glasses sat inside--- but the lens were missing from either eye piece. the Elf like woman was nosing around underneath on such rack, digging throw a pile of books half burned or otherwise destroyed.There were the two bodies of the monsters they had slain as well to search, pouches tied to their sword belts, pockets hidden in their coats of mail or raggy tunic like apparel.Moving a stack of books over Myralthrine's eye would be drawn to a crumpled pair of spectacles, mostly crumpled, one single lens remained intact in the twisted bronze frame. The lens glittered faintly with the promise of magic...\u00a0\u00a0Perception , loot, and other non sense.\u00a0[spoilers]\u00a0*\u00a0 The small fragmented slab seems to be a sort of lunar calendar judging by the pattern of dots above the text* The bronze plaque's text was set in a langue that was unknown to Myralthrine, but she would recall it to be the same font as the markings else where in the tower , the ones that had changed into common upon staring at them.\u00a0* One map depicted what looked like islands judging by the boats and other ornate sea monsters scattered about the very stylized navigational tool...\u00a0* Another seemed to be a detailed map of a city scape, complete with a legend, each building had a corresponding number it seemed.\u00a0* The last was a map of mountainous region judging by the etchings, the paper was notably older, or at least weathered than the other two.* The mask was a simple clay mask that covered the upper portion of the face and nose, leaving the mouth exposed. The golden feathers fanned out from the upper portion giving it a 'half sun' like appearance.\u00a0The glasses : Should Myraltrhine look through\u00a0 the lens, everything text wise would be as easily read as common.\u00a0Loot and things\u00a0* pens , ink, paper, and books a plenty were about the desk, and other utility items were likely to be hidden within the draws.\u00a0* there were other frames for glasses littered about but they too were smashed beyond repair.\u00a0*On the monsters.\u00a01:\u00a0 The beheaded creature:\u00a0 Missing his sword belt and weapon. in his jacket there was a leather pouch which contained some liquid, it smelled akin to soured milk.\u00a02: The second monster: still had his weapon, belt, and\u00a0 a small leather pouch attached to his belt about seven inches wide and 3 inches deep. A faint clatter of metal could be heard when removing it from the belt.\u00a0 Another container of liquid equally as foul as the first, and a necklace made of what could only be ears of various creatures... several of them were human.\u00a0The sword laying in the monsters hand, still steamed and hissed faintly... and gave off a putrid acidic stink.\u00a0\u00a0[/spoiler]\u00a0 [/right]\u00a0\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<div align=\"center\">\u00a0 Group2\u00a0<br>Players near: Myralthrine , unknown NPC\u00a0 </br></div>"}, "post-89593": {"user": "Myralthrine Host", "user_num": 3143, "timestamp": "1553295490000", "message": "Group 2Curiosity had a way of driving her far beyond her normal searching and looking for the eyepiece that the sylph of a girl described she\u2019d come across many things.

It was dangerous to charge headlong into even known portions of the tower.   The hallway the two had been walking down gave way to a wide open space. The space was so large that the light from the torch couldn't reach the walls or ceilings. Sienna kepted moving forward.     The large room its self was empty, aside from the two's echoing foot steps, the acoustics in the room were stunning if the echos were anything to go by...  Under foot patterns had been worked into the otherwise flat stone, swirls and other geometric shapes seemed to make up a larger pattern.     After about a hundred paces the two came to a doorway.  The thick wooden door sat next to the opening, iron hinges mangled, splinters littered the ground and the smell of death oozed from the doorway...    Sienna walked in, sword ready but lowered the weapon after only a moment.     The room was not extremely large, it had likely been some sort of storeroom once upon a time.  Six corpses laid scattered about the room, corpses of the creatures not much unlike the ones they had left in the other room, 4 of the 6 were beheaded...     Sienna stepped around the chaos with very little concern, moving to a heavy shelf which she shove aside.  Two travel packs were hidden in the corner nook. She made quick work of going through the packs, consolidating foods and water, as well as some clothing, once she was satisfied she patted the second bag with a tight lipped smile and turned back to Myralthrine. She made a writing gesture. if given the pad she'd write. \" Take what you need, she won't be needing it. And please take this as a gift for saving us.\"  Sienna wrote before extending a thick leather sheath to Myralthrine with a knife in it.The blade was easily 11\" long, and heavily weighted, A deep blood groove ran down the center of the razor pointed blade, the grip was rounded with a simple leather cord binding and had an iron ball at the rear as a pommel.

The Tower existed in no known state of true laws of physics or even her understanding of what real magic was capable of. It might extend to the sky itself or down into the pits of the very hell that some humans believed in. No matter what afterlife existed her she wished to find none of it. Answers she came for and answers she would get with time and perseverance. Both of which she carried in gobsmacking amounts. Sienna was limited to the light of the torch and while it harmed the greater scope of her vision it did not completely destroy it. The geometric patterns were clear to her the range to close to get the picture fully. If there were anything in the room to climb she would make note in order to return. Perhaps they held some cryptic message that may reveal more in the future or perhaps it was nothing. Difficult enough to govern or judge the true intentions of that which remained here she gave it no true pause for her earlier one had been regrettable. Making Sienna question if it was wise to keep her within her company was one of her concerns. The girl knew much about the Tower itself and the eye piece was invaluable but not hers. Sienna knew of it first meaning either she'd found it and realized its power or brought it with her and she was not a thief.

With the blade offered to her there was the first sign of hesitation, not a gift per say but an offering for services rendered. Had she been but a bit earlier the owner of the very thing might still be with them and even the note said 'us.' The corners of her lips turned downward at first before she took it giving her one solemn nod. Nothing needed to be written or said about the gesture. Then she began to evaluate the remaining. The pack her blood sister had carried was stronger than her own, the heft was nice and she transferred her belongings. It was fair that she would not need it anymore but she still had some guilt. Placing it over her shoulder once she was finished she hoped that their next location would be a different sort of camp  because returning here with the corpses of the creatures bothered her. Picking up the paper and writing she would put down, \"We should work on your speech first,\" she suggested adding, \"Perhaps if we can find out what they are we can fix it for a start.\" Communication would take them farther when they did not have to constantly write and transfer the page back and forth, especially if it came to another fight.
