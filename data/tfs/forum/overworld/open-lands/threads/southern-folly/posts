No one knows who built it, where it came from, or who its residents were. All anyone knows is that one day it appeared, and that it has more rooms than anyone has dared to explore. A small group of merchants have made the courtyard home, along with a few rooms that have been exorcised and blessed to ward off the hundreds of ghosts that were left behind when the structure was abandoned.The southern end of Folly is dark. Vines have grown over the windows and blocked out all but the stringiest rays of sunlight. Unlike the other wings, the hallways are thin here, choking, and still.The feeling that someone is just behind, a hair's breath away, never vanishes.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/5XujRD7.png"], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/5XujRD7.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/></div>"}, "post-93758": {"user": "Scarvy little Courage", "user_num": 3609, "timestamp": "1573792350000", "message": "A small red kobold scurries throughout the dark hallways.
