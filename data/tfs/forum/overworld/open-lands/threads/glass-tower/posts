He looks out and then opens a larger portal. Out of this black gateway a tower of polished metal slides down into the dirt. img15.deviantart.net/36ac/i/2011/117/3/3/the_black_tower_by_theyearbeforetime-d1pmlss.jpgThe inside of the tower is a mass of gears and booby trapped hallways. The top of the tower contains a circular room similarly booby trapped. Traps can be activated by the Nightmare Kings command or by the pressure plates and magical sensors in the rooms. Most of the traps are fast moving iron spikes. In the basement of the tower lies the forges which are run by clockwork men powered by energy geodes. The center of the tower contains the crystal that powers the magical barrier that protects the castle from kinetic attacks.Outside the tower lie razor sharp crystalline shards which line the fields surrounding the tower. These crystals appear to also raise the dead which shamble about outside the tower looking for things to convert to their cause. If one were to look at the tower from a distance they would see a pale yellow glow reflecting off the thousands of gems. Oddly enough bugs seem to swarm to this place and while they seem to not be able to get into the tower they do join the undead hordes outside of it and can be quite the pestilence.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "A portal opens and a black being walks through stepping unto desolate planes.
