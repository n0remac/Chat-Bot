The firelight flickered off the gold hilts of the daggers at his belt, curling along the draconic pommels and reflecting in the black sapphires, and the silver dragon skull charm that hung next to them.\u00a0The Noble\u00a0and\u00a0The Smith\u00a0argued good naturedly about proper smithing and enchanting techniques, the excitement in the shared discussion as they inspected the blade bound equally with ancient enchantments and sealing wards that both granted and curtailed it's power and that hammer that contained a spark that supposedly fell from a god's forge that could release it with explosive might. The firelight flickered over the silver wolf charm at The Noble's throat and the silver hammer charm that hung from the smith's wrist.\u00a0The Healer\u00a0tended the stew that hung over the fire, occasionally adding seasoning with absent practice, knowing that it was already good, but could be better. A beautifully intricate silver charm of a bird formed of minuscule vines hung from the end of the guitar that sat near at hand, humming with quiet power.\u00a0The Bard\u00a0sat nearby, filling the air with a simple but melodic tune that complimented the warm summer night. A sword of black metal sat near to hand with the rest of his gear, the fading sunlight glinting off of the silver charm of a wolf skull with extended fangs.\u00a0", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/user/3512", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/user/3226", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/user/3513", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/user/3514", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/user/3259"], "image_list": [], "html": "The five men gathered around the campsite, each of them doing what they were want to do.\u00a0"}}
