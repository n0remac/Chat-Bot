Placing the box on the floor before the duke the servant would carefully open the chest and the duke would see a katana laying in the box lined with red velvet.\u00a0\"For the Duke I present to you a sword I had fashioned for this very occasion by the very same sword smiths that made my own.\" he said and touched his own sword. \"Duke Konrad IV von Marschburg is the name I have had engraved into it's blade in our language on one side and your on the other side.

The now much smaller group heads into the feast.Again, much effort has been spent on the aesthetic of the feast hall. From the city to the castle, right down to the amount of water in each glass, everything is immaculate. There\u2019s not a missing button to be seen among the servants, no frayed shirt tails,  all of the flowers are in perfect bloom, and the knights have evidently polished their armor for the occasion. Though she supposes that she may be reading too far into it, the state of the decor leads Naoki to wonder in what manner the servants were threatened. She makes a mental note to see about poaching the staff responsible later.In any case, it seems some of the heads of state have already arrived. There\u2019s Shintaro, along with someone who by all indications would be Tawakoshi\u2019s leader. Both of whom seem to have brought their wives, and both of whom seem to have already presented gifts to the hosts. It is at this point that Lady Naoki begins to think that perhaps she ought to have brought a gift, and perhaps she ought to have considered the implications of bringing Iulia in the manner that she has. Precedent does her no favors today. Regardless, the lack of assigned seating is an interesting choice by the hosts. And if they\u2019re not going to, Lady Naoki opts not to put much thought into where she sits, glad not to be troubled with that particular minutia of formality. With a finger-wiggling wave to those already in attendance, The Empress seats herself near the middle of the table. Surreptitiously, she then replaces one of her glasses with a black ceramic mug.

Years and years ago, when her father still believed that forcing her to attend etiquette classes would help form her into the \u2018right sort of young lady\u2019, someone had suggested that Iulia had a certain exaggerated pace. The word they used, flounced, sounded so harsh and demeaning.  This pronouncement had so shaken young Iulia\u2019s mental image of herself that she turned to practicing a soft, measured walk. The added benefits included sneaking up on just about anyone, something far more useful than carrying books on her head or not spilling pitchers of rose water. It was this walk that the Foreign Service officer used to slide up the several steps to the courtyard and towards the hall beyond. Naoki had gone straight in without a word, just the merest nod of her head and two gestures.There was the matter that Iulia was severely outranked by everyone in attendance. This bothered her little, but she wondered slightly if her presence would cause any issues with the other guests. Hopefully not. She had been invited purposefully, as had everyone else.Around the edge of the courtyard, knights stood in gleaming rows. In the very background of the scene, wait staff went about their various duties with minorly harried airs. Being more behind the scene was what Iulia did at home. If she could get a moment to meet a few of the staff, she would be sure to ask them about their work and glean any potential insights that they might offer. Snubbing a doorman or rudely demanding something from someone\u2019s supposed \u2018inferior\u2019 was the perfect way to become immortalized as a first-rate git, no matter how much political power or influence the person in question might have.Iulia smiles to a guard closest to the door leading right into the hall. Naoki had made her way through there a few minutes prior. Best to take just a bit longer before going in herself, Iulia thought. Most of the other guests who had come together seemed to be regulated, married, or some other close relationship.She tugs at her beret slightly, setting it lower over her forehead and tucking in a few stray strands of hair. She would sit opposite Naoki, several seats down so as to not be directly across from the Empress. That way she could see and hear Naoki, but not be awkwardly involved in her conversations.Her mentor, Josef Zemp, would have taken a moment to smoke and make some wry comments disguised as advice. Fortunately, Iulia did not share his slightly disgusting pipeweed habit. And unfortunately, she was alone.

There was no need, certainly, to feel intimidated by all the strangeness. They seemed to be very fond of crosses as a motif, she noticed, wondering what they represented. Following Homura into the room, Kiri was dressed in an embroidered outer kimono of black silk, that featured on its lower back and sleeves a stylised landscape of Tawakoshi, featuring the iconic cedars and maples among mountainous rock, with stands of bamboo picked out in gold that matched the bamboo leaf motif of Homura\u2019s court robe. If one looked closely, animals such as deer and birds were just visible among the trees. Gold edged its collar and cuffs, and beneath Kiri wore a kimono of Hizashi pink that ranged from a cherry blossom colour at the top to a dark maroon at the bottom. Her flowery hair ornaments matched the gold accents on her clothing, glowing against the deep black of her upswept hair. Overall the impression was sumptuous without being overly ostentatious. Shintaro and Hotaru were the first people who caught Kiri\u2019s eye as well, and she was pleased that Homura had already begun to speak to them. As he spoke, she ventured a small smile to Hotaru, who was noticeably pregnant. \u201cIf you are from Katashima, you must surely be our distant cousins,\u201d she ventured to say, addressing her comment to Hotaru but including Shintaro within it as well. The Katashima diaspora had reached places other than Kiyonai it seemed, but she was loathe to give too much away lest these people turn out to be some of the Hizashi clan\u2019s old enemies. A new war was not something she relished. She approached the Duke and Duchess along with Homura and offered them a small bow as between equals, matching her husband\u2019s. Given the opportunity to present her gifts, Kiri gave a clap and two well-dressed servants carrying an evidently heavy large chest entered the room. \u201cDuchess Audrey and Duke Konrad, in our homeland of Tawakoshi it is our tradition to present gifts to our hosts. Not knowing your tastes, I hope these will prove acceptable to you.\u201d The servants opened the chest and array of items were shown to the royal couple, with Kiri giving commentary on only a few of them. All were luxury items, art pieces that displayed the taste and restraint of Tawakoshi society, as well as the supreme skill of the craftspeople; an elaborate lacquered jewellery box with many small compartments and designs in mother-of-pearl, beautifully glazed pottery, tiny intricate carved beads in the form of natural objects - a gourd plant, a curled sleeping mouse, and other such items. There was also silken cloth, dyed and figured in many patterns. \u201cPlease examine the rest as you wish, and if there is anything unfamiliar, I will be happy to explain its purpose,\u201d said Kiri, with another bow. \u201cThank you for your invitation, Duchess Audrey. It is a pleasure to see your beautiful country and to meet with you.\u201d Kiri noticed another two women enter the room, one merely gave a small wave before seating herself, and another, who seemed dressed in some kind of military uniform. Were they together? She wasn\u2019t sure as the second woman sat some distance from the first. Catching Naoki\u2019s wave, Kiri inclined her head very slightly towards the woman, not at all sure of who she was or what status she represented, and tried to not let her eyes widen rudely as she noticed the two pointed ears atop the woman\u2019s head. Was she a kitsune? How very strange. She turned aside from where the two women had sat down and tried to catch Homura\u2019s eye to see if he had noticed the rather odd pair.

Out comes a large gold piece, emblazoned with a stylized sun of the imperial crest on the obverse, and the face of Empress Naoki on the reverse. Iulia slides it, sun side up, for Haldar to view. It is a pleasantly weighty coin, the features are stamped evenly onto the metallic surface. \u201cThe first recorded mention of Naoki in Isra is in the business charter for an establishment known as The Midnight Sun.

The tables were made of the finest wood, and the cushioned chairs were fit for the royal attendants.  Shiny silverware, plates, and glasses had been assembled with the utmost caution by the servant girls.The few guards who stood within the hall were more for ceremony than anything else, carrying ceremonial weapons, save for a pair who wielded crossbows.  The virgin servant girls were dressed in silky white dresses, and looked attentive - ready to serve the guests in some manner if they were approached.One of the guests was a nobleman from Vessia.  He entered along with a scribe.  Both were dressed in dark, royal clothing - with the scribe wearing a set of glasses and carrying a book, an ink, and a quill.  When time permitted the scribe quickly scribbled notes in his tome.  The scribe\u2019s lord - Ulrich van der Steinlund - slowly paced the room and observed the attendants of the party.Warlord Shintaro Nishida Konrad appears stoic, yet open as he receives the visitors.  Shintaro Nishida and his wife, Hotaru are the first to approach them.  \u201cYou are most welcome,\u201d Konrad replies, his voice soft but rugged.  He was a tall, imposing man with a bald head and dark blue eyes; his presence gave off an air of intimidation.\u201cAnd,\u201d Lady Audrey chirped up, her voice sweet and lovely, \u201cwe thank you for the gifts.\u201d  Two servant girls fetch the jugs of Cattle Bug nectar before transporting it to another room in the castle.Konrad motioned at the tables that lay within the great hall, \u201cplease, take a seat and prepare for the coming meal.\u201dRegent Homura Hizashi \u201cHold there,\u201d one of the Knight-Brothers prevents Homura and his retinue from entering Ritterheim.  \u201cYou and your lady are permitted entry, but your warriors and escort must remain outside.\u201d  Despite their fascination with the appearance of the men\u2019s armor and weapons, the Brothers were strictly ordered not to allow any armed guards or similar within the castle.  Although once they saw some servants carrying a gift bow, one continued \u201cthe servants carrying the box may enter, but once the gift is delivered they must retreat outside the castle.\u201dAssuming Homura complies...\u201cWell met, Homura,\u201d Konrad greets these foreigners with profound interest.  \u201cI am glad you decided to take the journey, it means a lot to my people and I.\u201d  Upon seeing the gift which Homura has brought Konrad appears impressed - which rarely happens.  \u201cI am without words,\u201d he finally says as he observes the elegant blade.  \u201cThe gift is most appreciated, as is its purpose.  I can only hope to match your generosity and thoughtfulness in the future.\u201d  Konrad orders the gift box to be seated nearby his throne at the head of the hall.Once Kiri presents her own gifts, Lady Audrey appears equally impressed as Konrad was at the sword.  \u201cHow intricate!\u201d she exclaims, barely able to contain her joy and curiosity.  \u201cIt would be my pleasure to receive such gifts!\u201d  Lady Audrey begins to plan where to display the beautiful art pieces, and has her own servants transport the fine crafts to another room of the castle.\u201cAnd I must compliment your robe,\u201d Audrey also says, referring to her kimono.  \u201cHow\u2026 elaborate and beautiful!\u201dErik Haldar \u201cWe are most pleased with your arrival,\u201d Lady Audrey assures, Erik and Freya.  \u201cAnd moreso with the food and drink you have brought.  Our chefs have arranged for it to be served during the main feast, and we are eager to try it.\u201d\u201cWelcome to Audria,\u201d Konrad finishes, \u201cplease, take a seat and prepare for the feast!\u201dThese Taingaardians remind the Duke and Duchess of the Varan from Asgeir, and being close allies with those northmen they feel quite comfortable around the nords.Once the main assembly had entered the great hall of Ritterheim an order was given to close the main doors.  As the guests found seats of their choosing and discussed amongst themselves Duke Konrad and Duchess Audrey took position at the head of the room, standing before their thrones.  Ulrich van der Steinlund took his seat at the far-end of the assembled tables, along with his scribe.  He appeared to observe the event, as opposed to actually attending it.Ding!The sound of a ringing bell would catch the attention of those in attendance.  The chit-chat would die down, and the room grew quiet; all attention was directed at the lord and lady of Audria.Konrad began to speak and his voice boomed across the great hall.  \u201cThe Duchy\u2019s finest chefs have prepared a splendid meal for our guests, and the Taingaardians have provided their own additions as well.\u201d  The Duke gave a thankful nod towards Erik.  \u201cBut before the feast begins\u2026 we will have words.\u201d  Lady Audrey seemed to take this as a que and sat in her throne.\u201cFirst, I must formally thank you all for attending the First Audrian Banquet.  I do not have the words to express my gratitude.  It represents your willingness to accept peace, friendship, diplomacy, and cooperation with the Audrians.  The Varan of Asgeir believe the strongest bonds are forged in the heat of battle; this is true, but for lords and ladies such as ourselves, who wish to avoid battle, gatherings such as this is the best we can do.\u201cI would like to extend my hand\u2026 an offer of guaranteed peace to each of you.  And above that, an alliance of nations.  The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.  So may we all stand together in this world - a bastion of peace and order against the tides of darkness and chaos.  Trade, prosperity, peace, order, and justice\u2026 this is the world Audria wants to build with each of you.\u201cThat said\u2026 I have a few announcements to make.  The first\u2026 is the absolution of the Brotherhood.\u201d  Konrad was silent for a moment as he lets the words sink in.  Ulrich van der Steinlund appeared appalled, but did not speak.  \u201cI hereby declare that all Knight-Brothers are relieved of their duties, vows, and oaths.  It will take time to spread this message and ensure an order dedicated to the Faith is peacefully eradicated.\u201d  So far, only the Knight-Brothers in Audria were aware of this move; each member, however, would be generously compensated for his service.\u201cSecond, I would like to inform you all of the Vorstuga College - a state-funded university preparing to open in the city of Vorstuga.  I encourage intellectuals from all across the Overworld to volunteer as teachers - and I invite the youth of the world to attend as students.  Let us enlighten the world with our brightest minds.\u201cAnd finally\u2026\u201d  As if on que, the pair of knight-brothers wielding crossbows prepared bolts on their weapons; they did it in such a discreet move, however, that few of the guests would notice them.  \u201cThe Duchy of Audria declares independence from the Vessian Empire.  I proclaim myself King Konrad I of Audria, and my wife as Queen Audrey I.  I ask that you recognize my state as the Kingdom of Audria - no longer shackled by the bonds of the Vessian Emperor.\u201d\u201cAn OUTRAGE!\u201d cried Ulrich van der Steinlund.  His chair screeched upon the floor of the hall as he jumped up from his seat.  \u201cAn elector does not have the power to secede from the Empire!  This is an illegal action and-\u201d\u201cStill your tongue lest we cut it from your mouth,\u201d the King threatened.  \u201cI\u2019d prefer you speak clearly when you bring the news to your Emperor.\u201d\u201cThis is a rebellion!\u00a0 You declare war on the Empire with this move!\u201d Ulrich continued to holler, \u201cyou and your people - your allies will pay for this insurrection, Konrad!\u201dBy this point the two crossbow-wielding knights had approached the Vessian elector and threatened to shoot him.  \u201cCome with us, Count Ulrich,\u201d they demanded.  \u201cWe have orders to kill you if you resist.\u201d\u201cKeep your damn hands off of me - and lower those crossbows!  You are Knights of the Black Cross!  Your allegiance is to the Emperor, not to this pretender king!  In the name of God - in the name of the Emperor - in the name of the Church - I demand you arrest-!\u201dShrikt-shrikt!Ulrich\u2019s outburst was cut short as two crossbow bolts were shot through both eye sockets.  His body fell limp and he choked on his last breath as he collapsed onto the ground.  The knights did not hesitate to grab the man\u2019s body and drag him away to another room; it was almost expected\u2026\u00a0 Some servant girls quickly removed the patch of rug which was stained with blood and carried it off to the same room....\u201cAnd now we feast!\u201d Queen Audrey proclaimed.A curtain lifted, revealing a band,\u00a0and banquet music began to play.Servant girls pushed carts filled with roasted pork, fresh bread, strawberries, pottage, nuts cheese, and other juicy and succulent choices!  They paraded around and served the food in equal measure to each and every guest.  Other servants came with various wines and beverages, offering each patron their preferred choice.  The Taingaardian addition was also served - by their own servants if provided, but otherwise served by Audrian virgins.The scribe - who so far was to stunned to make a move - eventually jumped up and ran towards the door; after struggling to open them, a knight assisted him, and he was allowed to leave.\u00a0 His message to the Emperor was quite obvious.It was at this time that KING Konrad and QUEEN Audrey sat at a table level with everyone else.", "link_list": ["/user/565", "/user/2725", "/user/3106", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_6AQA4uzD0"], "image_list": [], "html": "The great hall of Ritterheim was decorated lavishly; elaborate chandeliers hung from the vaulted ceilings; marble columns were decorated with romanticized reimaginings of Angelist saints and heroes; royal red rugs lined the walkways, and crimson curtains covered the windows and entrances to the other halls and rooms.

While chairs were not unknown in Tawakoshi, they only existed as mere novelty items and were hardly ever used. It all seemed most odd to her to be seated so far from the floor, and wearing kimono was not entirely comfortable in the straight backed chairs, but she hoped she carried herself with decorum enough that no one noticed her unease with the furniture. She was feeling pleased to have made the acquaintance of Shintaro and Hotaru, especially as Lord Shintaro expressed an interest in visiting Tawakoshi. She also believed that her gifts had gone down well with Audrians, and that the banquet generally was progressing well. From overheard conversation, coupled with the snippets of information that Lord Akagi had given her, she ascertained that the lady kitsune, or \u2013 whatever type of foreign yokai she might be \u2013 was Empress Naoki of Isra \u2013 another woman who wielded great power over this side of the globe. Kiri had earmarked Naoki for her next person to attempt to engage in conversation, and as such made sure to pick a seat near enough that they could converse. However, before she was able to give more than a nod and smile in greeting to the Empress, the duke and duchess began their introductions. The opening speech about forging bonds, and peace between nations was pleasant to hear. To be here at a time when Tawakoshi was opening up to the world, in the presence of other leaders, under a banner of peace and prosperity \u2013 of course it appealed to Kiri, and made her glad that she and Homura had made the not inconsiderable effort of attending. She did not understand who or what the Brotherhood were, but listened regardless, watching to see if anyone made any reaction to this that would give her a clue, but not gaining much from it. The talk about a college for the youth of the world made Kiri\u2019s mind jump instantly to her two children. Would Masanori learn useful tools of statesmanship if he would study abroad, that he could bring back to inform his rule as Regent after Homura? Would Miya find a foreign education helpful to not only secure a worthy prince to marry \u2013 perhaps the offspring of Hotaru and Shintaro would be an option \u2013 but also to advance her own cause once in a foreign court. Were there any wise teachers that they could send from Tawakoshi to spread their enlightened ways to others? She was rather caught up in this dream of a golden future, to the point that the power grab and sudden assassination made her jolt involuntarily. How ghastly! How immensely gauche and barbaric to kill your overlord in front of an audience! To do it behind closed doors in complete secrecy was the only civilised way. Moreover, it chilled her to hear such words of peace followed by such a display of barbarism. How could they take such words at face value when followed by a murder? Besides, what purpose did it serve? Were the Audrians merely trying to make sure that the world at large favoured their claim for independence? Did they wish the world to unite in war against the \u201cVessian Empire\u201d whoever they were. She felt as though they had been manipulated into becoming involved with some politics that had no notion of, and her countenance seemed to pale, her eyes darken, and a stillness settle on her. She was busy staring at Lord Shintaro's wife for her frankly bizarre reaction of applause when she noticed Homura trying to catch her attention. She met his eyes and nodded slowly. \u201cI will not take hospitality at the scene of a murder,\u201d she replied in an equal whisper. When Homura stood, she stood with him, only a fraction behind. \u201cTawakoshi would be pleased to open a dialogue of diplomacy with any of you honoured nobles gathered here,\u201d she said, her eyes passing over the foreign nobility who had come to the feast \u2013 the Isran delegation, the Aozorans, the Taingaarders, and others, \u201cbut we will not do so at the table of those who speak of peace and prosperity with one mouth and deal death and betrayal with the other.\u201d Her eyes locked upon the duke and duchess, demanding an explanation.

There were forces at work set in motion for quite some time, contingency plans activated and old documents pulled forth. Men in shady rooms smoked cigars, social events were quietly held with those of\u2026 incorrect allegiances not invited. Yet, it had to be given Konrad had picked an opportune moment for his seccession. In the Empire things were not too well; a plague had ravage Romulsburg and a noble coup attempt in Augustgrad was barely stifled. Armed forces of the new Kingdom would wait and muster, yet apparently no invasion was forthcoming. Fortnights passed and all was quiet. Yet if Konrad thought he avoided retribution, he was sorely mistaken, for with his wife and son absent along with other factors he was not so strong himself\u2026.Dulce et Decorum est Pro Patria MoriNone would be able to discern a single main cause of what historians would later dub \u201cThe Audrian Civil War.\u201d Though thousands would die and hatred lasting centuries would be fostered, the root of so much bloodshed would be ever elusive. The events on Kreiter Street would be one point of note. The Vessian Crossbowmen, Engineers, and other auxiliaries employed by the Order for so long did not suddenly disappear with the disbanding of the Order. Many of these men suddenly found themselves without jobs, and unable to go to their families back in the Empire. Resentful, poor, desperate, but armed, these men were not to be trifled with. Konrad\u2019s considerable legacy reputation and respect owed was forgotten by none, but this would only last so long. In but a week after secession, not a single one of these soldiers spoke favourably of the King, even among those taken into his new \u201cprofessional\u201d armed forces. They roamed the streets in bands, often spilling into taverns and taking as they felt freely, stewing in hatred amongst themselves. In truth, if one of them was asked when they really started to see Konrad in their current ways they would have an issue remembering and only a few particularly bright ones would remember a figure in a neat hat and clothing telling them just how vile Konrad was, all his crimes, what a traitor he was. For other men, they had their own issues. It wasn\u2019t just soldiers who had common folk in the Empire. More than half of the people in Audria were ethnically originating from some part of Vessia, typically Augustgrad. Even if this was to be ignored, sudden economic changes were not. People were promised prosperity with new merchants but none was forthcoming. Though shipping to and from the Empire was an arduous process the Mountains defending Audria were also difficult to navigate. In addition, it meant that hundreds of affluent traders now had nobody to sell their wares to en-masse, and at the same time many goods could not be purchased. Contracts were broken, and other such official matters. But what many forget is that when the rich suffer, it is guaranteed that those beneath them are off even worse. Whole warehouses of food were let to rot, clothes were devoured by moths with freezing children just outside the stores. Over the single night of seccession more than a thousand men suddenly found themselves unemployed. These men found much in common with the Vessian Troopers, and in pubs they let errant lips seal the future. One man said somebody ought to knock Konrad down a peg, another said he\u2019d do it if he could, a third man - perhaps with a tall hat and quite fancy clothes - said that he should. Audria was founded as a Theocracy, a Knightly Order grounded in Angelism being in effect the regime. Though things changed, the people were always religious and God-fearing, particularly of the Malleus Maleficarum - Inquisitors, Witch Hunters, Reichskommissars - who could dole out punishment whenever, wherever, whoever, and whatever a man was. Nothing would hide a man from their cruel wrath, and even if it did then in the after-life it would not. The disbanding of the Order and Audria\u2019s secularization suddenly meant that Churches went unfunded, government would not assist in defending Church caravans from delivering foodstuffs to those in need of them. Bandits across the world saw open season upon them. Not too different was the predicament of the Knights of the Order. Hundreds, thousands of men who had so much faith, so much zeal indoctrinated in them were suddenly told that all they lived for was naught. They had to put their swords away, or be enemies of this new state. Those Chapter houses outside Audria refused this dissolution outright, continuing their work. But, at the same time, this was not effective. As a result of Konrad\u2019s Order the entirety of the Erstonian Order was annihilated without reinforcements, support, or adequate means of evacuation. Who else was to blame for this tragic loss of life but Konrad? Erstonia was not the only place where opportunists struck, all over the overworld Chapter Houses were attacked with not even nuns and choir boys avoiding slaughter. Many sites fought back valiantly even surviving the onslaught, but an equal amounts burned with the only souls left to tell the tale swearing it was at the hands of those bearing the crest of the von Audria line. In anger, many of these Knights, peerless warriors with repute all across their fatherland and motherland would return home to openly declare opposition to Konrad. Indeed, one might have already discerned the Malleus Maleficarum at work but their role could not be overstated by future historians. Much was talked about Audria\u2019s future at Konrad\u2019s infamous banquet. It took a day of rumour spreading by Imperial Intelligence to insure that Konrad had indeed agreed to some sort of vassal state arrangement with Isra. Not wanting to be ruled by a foreign tyrant, this embittered even the most ardent supporter of the Audrian declaration of independence. Public figures who spoke in favour of the new King died in one way or another. In some cases a Witch Hunter walking straight through the streets of a village to perform a Mayor\u2019s Last Rites before putting a crossbow bolt in their head would find no resistance; indeed a fearful populace would silently watch the event as even bodyguards stopped aside for the men for whom it was said villages burned to end a single tainted soul. Carrot and Stick was the simplest manner to describe their actions for draconian discipline and fear made sure common folk did not turn towards the new King, while promise of a brighter future made them turn away from him. Interestingly enough, though the rebellion represented the reactionary thought of the land there was a considerable liberal element in it too. Autonomy and fact a mere Duke ruled Audria before meant that people had considerable freedoms they feared they would no longer enjoy under direct rule of a King, but this was doubled as this element interacted with others of the rebellion against Konrad. Many feared under the rumoured upcoming vassalry to Isra they would be trading one tyranny for another. It was said taxes would be raised for the preposterous \u201cprofessional army\u201d of Konrad, something that never went down well. In the past merchants had considerable leverage over the Empire because they had the card of rebellion to play, the threat of going to other nations to trade. But now with only one nation looking favourably upon Audria, the country had far less leverage with its trading partners and indeed the prices they paid and sold at would only worsen in the current state of affairs. Though people held their frustrations bottled in under pressure for much time, they were quite suddenly released all in one powerful moment. Die Gross Hund was a quite lively inn, noted for the fact every worker spoke the common language rather than Vessische to guests, and it was there that more or less every single foreign merchant and worker lived. On either side of it were the houses of Sir Albrecht von Vicht and Lord Amadeus Blutcher; both ardent supporters of the new regime. It was also located perfectly between Ritterheim and the more poor parts of Salem, a place where people of all walks of life in Audria could meet. Be they horrified Clergyman, disenfranchised trooper, jobless commoner, disgraced Knight, honour-bound noble or a merchant at the brink of bankruptcy it was somewhere that they all got a taste of each other\u2019s frustration and thus had it amplified. Luckily, they had a place to vent it\u2026.It was somewhere near late evening, the first torch was thrown. A window of the hotel shattered, and smoke billowed out. Dozens more followed suit, whole casks of inky black oil poured over the three buildings and set alight. A minute or so passed until people within began to scream. They ran outside, but they would prefer to stay inside if they knew what awaited. The lucky ones had crossbow bolts by the more calm troopers thud into their brains, all turning dark quickly and with little pain. Others weren\u2019t so fortunate. Some of the more brutal soldiers marched forth and began to do standard procedure of torture and interrogation with a few personal additions to the usual ensemble of hooks, blades, pears of anguish, and other vile items. Angry woodsmen grabbed ahold of the people escaping fire and hacked them into bits with axes. Victims were hung on meathooks (many still alive) while others had their eyes gouged out before being dragged back into the fire. Yet for all this brutality, it seemed people were happy. Soldiers sung old songs, an old man played an accordion, children giggled and pointed while imitating the actions of gruesome violence. This sentiment spread like wildfire across the whole land: people who weren\u2019t human pulled by the scruff of  their neck and let slowly hang from nooses of barbed wire, while of the humans those who could not speak Vessiche were hogtied and thrown into sewers to drown in foetid filth. Guards were called forth to stop the rioting but the fact was they were ordinary people too, the majority simply simply joining in. Of those that didn\u2019t most ran, before disappearing mysteriously it is said. Within an hour, not a single foreigner was left alive. The rioting grew stronger, but outside of the two nobles not a hair was apparently harmed of the government and its citizens to public knowledge. An armoury was broken into, and the soldiers gave out arms and armour. Warehouse locks were smashed and food was handed out, their guards not obstructing the actions in anyway. But for now at least, peace reigned in technicality. Priests and other speakers stood on upraised platforms, they called for the abdication of Konrad and a restoration of sanity to the Kingdom. Men flew Imperial flags, they assembled with banners and oaths of loyalty to the Empire in great processions. The anthem of the Empire was sung, along with Church hymns. From every direction folk marched upon Ritterheim, though many were armed (and this came as a natural part of who they were, soldier or Knight) they were a tiny fraction, less than a twelfth. As street after street was passed, there was a Knight on horseback was at their head, the quite famous Felhurt von Rott. A man with a distinguished record as Hoch Schwertenfuhrer he was kind, pious and honourable, kind, and seen as a level headed figure. From windows flower petals were thrown, while what pathetic resistance of some riot oriented guards was mustered would be quickly pushed back, events that if one were a suspicious man would be considered too smooth, to easily going\u2026. At last, with thousands of people at his back, Felhurt approached the gates of Ritterheim. He gave a wave to the guards on duty from his horse, radiating confidence and general \u201crightness\u201d. Even though he was helmeted, folk would be easily able to tell he was smiling in an uplifting manner. \u201cGreetings kinsmen!\u201d He shouted, no effort put into letting his voice go across such a vast area, every part of procession of thousands hearing him and even King Konrad within would be able to hear his words.\u201cWe are gathered here today on the Ninth of Nebelung, the day of fate, in which so much important was done \u2014 and we the people have a simple declaration. We call upon self-proclaimed King Konrad to abdicate, and quit this childish play at monarch. He shall have a fair trial, and shall be promised his life as well as a comfortable retirement for his services to the Fatherland. We have no desire to see this escalate to bloodshed, we simply wish to see order, and thus by the extension the Order restored, pardon my joke!\u201dPeople laughed, even the guards of Ritterheim could not suppress a chuckle at the man\u2019s charisma despite their allegiances being firmly with Konrad. \u201cWe simply want a restoration of Justice, and to cleave apart this rebellious madness with the Sword of Truth. But as of this day, regardless of what he himself states, the history of this vile falsehood, the so called Kingdom of Audria is annulled, expunged from all proper records. Not a penny of taxes shall go to the impostor upon his self made throne, not a single true son of Vessia the Fatherland and Audria the Motherland shall owe him homage. All who agree to this treachery are declared Excommunicate Traitoris, and are subject to a similar fair trial. Glory to the Emperor, Glory to the Imperium, Glory to the Order, Glory to Mankind!\u201d The chant was taken up, and as one a song began. A thousand hearts all rise beat in time, And salute God\u2019s grace so great; divine!Church bells chime, they chime they chime!What fools face us in war-time?Dear Motherland my heart is thine,Dear Fatherland you\u2019re all that\u2019s mine!Whence, the foe\u2019s shall come, attack,To ends of earth we\u2019ll drive them back!But, it seemed the Guards would have none of it. Men were pressing further to the organized line of them, trying to push past the shield wall to get into Ritterheim and dethrone the King themselves. The guards pushed back with their shields, and in turn the mob pushed back upon them. It was not long until a man was hit quite hard upon the head with the boss of a shield, falling further onto his head. This did solicit quite some anger, and folk began to show it. Men clobbered the shields, kicked them, and pushed. The guards naturally responded with their own escalation, and quite soon a feedback loop of incrementing violence was created. It was not too long before one of the guards had so many men upon him he struck out with his club, breaking a neck in the process. Likewise, several rioters latched onto a guard and pulled him out of formation, dragging him out and then proceeding to beat him, harder, harder, harder, until knives were drawn, several short pangs of pain were felt and then the man was trampled over left to die forgotten.A hotly debated point would soon be who fired first. Many say it was the rioters, an over-enthusiastic member of the Vessian auxiliaries or a huntsman unable to sell his catches. Others say it was a Captain of the Guard drawing a hand crossbow and letting it loose into the face of a man before him. Regardless, future generations would be able to recall from elders that whoever did it, the man apparently had a neat officer\u2019s cap upon his head, though his features were quite unmemorable for some strange reason. After that moment a threshold was reached and violence truly began. The Knights in the mob went forth with their blades drawn and went through the guards like mincemeat, heads and limbs flying left and right. At the same time, some fool on the walls thought it was a good idea to let loose ballistae upon a mass of thousands of civilians. At the front men tried to push back, whereas the armed men at the back tried to push forward. The bloodshed was inescapable despite Clergy calling for an immediate stop along with the charismatic Fellhurt, and then a heavy bolt hit him in the chest. Barely breathing he was carried off to safety, and another threshold was reached. A brawl turned into a massacre, hundreds dying in minutes. Though holy fire of the mind propelled men beyond human limitations they simply could not try to assault the city, and eventually they were pushed back. As it was clear they had to retreat, many men stood and fought, foretelling what was to happen moments later. As folk ran back the men on the walls fired with crossbows wave after wave of bolts into the backs of the people with blood flowing like a river down the streets. As Konrad might watch the events from his Castle, he would just for a moment see a man on the roof of one of the buildings look straight at him, tip a tall hat in mocking and then disappear. With his bird\u2019s eye view, he would be able to see the country slowly starting to burn\u2026.Come, traitor-filth, play with me!As news spread, folk were horrified. People took their belongings, their families, all that they could and left the city. Come next morning almost half the city of Salem left, much of the remaining people looters or soldiers for either side of the conflict. The hear of Audria\u2019s heart was in Konrad\u2019s hands, but all across the land towns suddenly flew the Vessian flag without a single official Vessian State Legionnaire ever stepping foot in it. Even in Salem brother killed brother, Knights of honour running down civilians flying the Kingdom\u2019s flag, Guards setting alight those that flew a Black Cross.The Audrian civil war had begun.

Contracts were broken, and other such official matters. But what many forget is that when the rich suffer, it is guaranteed that those beneath them are off even worse. Whole warehouses of food were let to rot, clothes were devoured by moths with freezing children just outside the stores. Over the single night of seccession more than a thousand men suddenly found themselves unemployed. These men found much in common with the Vessian Troopers, and in pubs they let errant lips seal the future. One man said somebody ought to knock Konrad down a peg, another said he\u2019d do it if he could, a third man - perhaps with a tall hat and quite fancy clothes - said that he should. <br/><br/>Audria was founded as a Theocracy, a Knightly Order grounded in Angelism being in effect the regime. Though things changed, the people were always religious and God-fearing, particularly of the Malleus Maleficarum - Inquisitors, Witch Hunters, Reichskommissars - who could dole out punishment whenever, wherever, whoever, and whatever a man was. Nothing would hide a man from their cruel wrath, and even if it did then in the after-life it would not. The disbanding of the Order and Audria\u2019s secularization suddenly meant that Churches went unfunded, government would not assist in defending Church caravans from delivering foodstuffs to those in need of them. Bandits across the world saw open season upon them. Not too different was the predicament of the Knights of the Order. Hundreds, thousands of men who had so much faith, so much zeal indoctrinated in them were suddenly told that all they lived for was naught. They had to put their swords away, or be enemies of this new state. Those Chapter houses outside Audria refused this dissolution outright, continuing their work. But, at the same time, this was not effective. As a result of Konrad\u2019s Order the entirety of the Erstonian Order was annihilated without reinforcements, support, or adequate means of evacuation. Who else was to blame for this tragic loss of life but Konrad? Erstonia was not the only place where opportunists struck, all over the overworld Chapter Houses were attacked with not even nuns and choir boys avoiding slaughter. Many sites fought back valiantly even surviving the onslaught, but an equal amounts burned with the only souls left to tell the tale swearing it was at the hands of those bearing the crest of the von Audria line. In anger, many of these Knights, peerless warriors with repute all across their fatherland and motherland would return home to openly declare opposition to Konrad. <br/><br/>Indeed, one might have already discerned the Malleus Maleficarum at work but their role could not be overstated by future historians. Much was talked about Audria\u2019s future at Konrad\u2019s infamous banquet. It took a day of rumour spreading by Imperial Intelligence to insure that Konrad had indeed agreed to some sort of vassal state arrangement with Isra. Not wanting to be ruled by a foreign tyrant, this embittered even the most ardent supporter of the Audrian declaration of independence. Public figures who spoke in favour of the new King died in one way or another. In some cases a Witch Hunter walking straight through the streets of a village to perform a Mayor\u2019s Last Rites before putting a crossbow bolt in their head would find no resistance; indeed a fearful populace would silently watch the event as even bodyguards stopped aside for the men for whom it was said villages burned to end a single tainted soul. Carrot and Stick was the simplest manner to describe their actions for draconian discipline and fear made sure common folk did not turn towards the new King, while promise of a brighter future made them turn away from him. <br/><br/>Interestingly enough, though the rebellion represented the reactionary thought of the land there was a considerable liberal element in it too. Autonomy and fact a mere Duke ruled Audria before meant that people had considerable freedoms they feared they would no longer enjoy under direct rule of a King, but this was doubled as this element interacted with others of the rebellion against Konrad. Many feared under the rumoured upcoming vassalry to Isra they would be trading one tyranny for another. It was said taxes would be raised for the preposterous \u201cprofessional army\u201d of Konrad, something that never went down well. In the past merchants had considerable leverage over the Empire because they had the card of rebellion to play, the threat of going to other nations to trade. But now with only one nation looking favourably upon Audria, the country had far less leverage with its trading partners and indeed the prices they paid and sold at would only worsen in the current state of affairs. <br/><br/>Though people held their frustrations bottled in under pressure for much time, they were quite suddenly released all in one powerful moment. Die Gross Hund was a quite lively inn, noted for the fact every worker spoke the common language rather than Vessische to guests, and it was there that more or less every single foreign merchant and worker lived. On either side of it were the houses of Sir Albrecht von Vicht and Lord Amadeus Blutcher; both ardent supporters of the new regime. It was also located perfectly between Ritterheim and the more poor parts of Salem, a place where people of all walks of life in Audria could meet. Be they horrified Clergyman, disenfranchised trooper, jobless commoner, disgraced Knight, honour-bound noble or a merchant at the brink of bankruptcy it was somewhere that they all got a taste of each other\u2019s frustration and thus had it amplified. Luckily, they had a place to vent it\u2026.<br/><br/>It was somewhere near late evening, the first torch was thrown. A window of the hotel shattered, and smoke billowed out. Dozens more followed suit, whole casks of inky black oil poured over the three buildings and set alight. A minute or so passed until people within began to scream. They ran outside, but they would prefer to stay inside if they knew what awaited. The lucky ones had crossbow bolts by the more calm troopers thud into their brains, all turning dark quickly and with little pain. Others weren\u2019t so fortunate. Some of the more brutal soldiers marched forth and began to do standard procedure of torture and interrogation with a few personal additions to the usual ensemble of hooks, blades, pears of anguish, and other vile items. Angry woodsmen grabbed ahold of the people escaping fire and hacked them into bits with axes. Victims were hung on meathooks (many still alive) while others had their eyes gouged out before being dragged back into the fire. Yet for all this brutality, it seemed people were happy. <a href=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Soldiers sung old songs</a>, an old man played an accordion, children giggled and pointed while imitating the actions of gruesome violence. This sentiment spread like wildfire across the whole land: people who weren\u2019t human pulled by the scruff of  their neck and let slowly hang from nooses of barbed wire, while of the humans those who could not speak Vessiche were hogtied and thrown into sewers to drown in foetid filth. Guards were called forth to stop the rioting but the fact was they were ordinary people too, the majority simply simply joining in. Of those that didn\u2019t most ran, before disappearing mysteriously it is said. <br/><br/>Within an hour, not a single foreigner was left alive. The rioting grew stronger, but outside of the two nobles not a hair was apparently harmed of the government and its citizens to public knowledge. An armoury was broken into, and the soldiers gave out arms and armour. Warehouse locks were smashed and food was handed out, their guards not obstructing the actions in anyway. <br/><br/>But for now at least, peace reigned in technicality. Priests and other speakers stood on upraised platforms, they called for the abdication of Konrad and a restoration of sanity to the Kingdom. Men flew Imperial flags, they assembled with banners and oaths of loyalty to the Empire in great processions. The anthem of the Empire was sung, along with Church hymns. From every direction folk marched upon Ritterheim, though many were armed (and this came as a natural part of who they were, soldier or Knight) they were a tiny fraction, less than a twelfth. As street after street was passed, there was a Knight on horseback was at their head, the quite famous Felhurt von Rott. A man with a distinguished record as Hoch Schwertenfuhrer he was kind, pious and honourable, kind, and seen as a level headed figure. From windows flower petals were thrown, while what pathetic resistance of some riot oriented guards was mustered would be quickly pushed back, events that if one were a suspicious man would be considered too smooth, to easily going\u2026. <br/><br/>At last, with thousands of people at his back, Felhurt approached the gates of Ritterheim. He gave a wave to the guards on duty from his horse, radiating confidence and general \u201crightness\u201d. Even though he was helmeted, folk would be easily able to tell he was smiling in an uplifting manner. <br/><br/>\u201cGreetings kinsmen!\u201d <br/><br/>He shouted, no effort put into letting his voice go across such a vast area, every part of procession of thousands hearing him and even King Konrad within would be able to hear his words.<br/><br/>\u201cWe are gathered here today on the Ninth of Nebelung, the day of fate, in which so much important was done \u2014 and we the people have a simple declaration. We call upon self-proclaimed King Konrad to abdicate, and quit this childish play at monarch. He shall have a fair trial, and shall be promised his life as well as a comfortable retirement for his services to the Fatherland. We have no desire to see this escalate to bloodshed, we simply wish to see order, and thus by the extension the Order restored, pardon my joke!\u201d<br/><br/>People laughed, even the guards of Ritterheim could not suppress a chuckle at the man\u2019s charisma despite their allegiances being firmly with Konrad. <br/><br/>\u201cWe simply want a restoration of Justice, and to cleave apart this rebellious madness with the Sword of Truth. But as of this day, regardless of what he himself states, the history of this vile falsehood, the so called Kingdom of Audria is annulled, expunged from all proper records. Not a penny of taxes shall go to the impostor upon his self made throne, not a single true son of Vessia the Fatherland and Audria the Motherland shall owe him homage. All who agree to this treachery are declared Excommunicate Traitoris, and are subject to a similar fair trial. Glory to the Emperor, Glory to the Imperium, Glory to the Order, Glory to Mankind!\u201d <br/><br/>The chant was taken up, and as one a song began. <br/><br/><div align=\"center\"><i>A thousand hearts all rise beat in time, <br/>And salute God\u2019s grace so great; divine!<br/>Church bells chime, they chime they chime!<br/>What fools face us in war-time?<br/><br/>Dear Motherland my heart is thine,<br/>Dear Fatherland you\u2019re all that\u2019s mine!<br/>Whence, the foe\u2019s shall come, attack,<br/>To ends of earth we\u2019ll drive them back!</i><br/></div><br/>But, it seemed the Guards would have none of it. Men were pressing further to the organized line of them, trying to push past the shield wall to get into Ritterheim and dethrone the King themselves. The guards pushed back with their shields, and in turn the mob pushed back upon them. It was not long until a man was hit quite hard upon the head with the boss of a shield, falling further onto his head. This did solicit quite some anger, and folk began to show it. Men clobbered the shields, kicked them, and pushed. The guards naturally responded with their own escalation, and quite soon a feedback loop of incrementing violence was created. It was not too long before one of the guards had so many men upon him he struck out with his club, breaking a neck in the process. Likewise, several rioters latched onto a guard and pulled him out of formation, dragging him out and then proceeding to beat him, harder, harder, harder, until knives were drawn, several short pangs of pain were felt and then the man was trampled over left to die forgotten.<br/><br/>A hotly debated point would soon be who fired first. Many say it was the rioters, an over-enthusiastic member of the Vessian auxiliaries or a huntsman unable to sell his catches. Others say it was a Captain of the Guard drawing a hand crossbow and letting it loose into the face of a man before him. Regardless, future generations would be able to recall from elders that whoever did it, the man apparently had a neat officer\u2019s cap upon his head, though his features were quite unmemorable for some strange reason. <br/><br/>After that moment a threshold was reached and violence truly began. The Knights in the mob went forth with their blades drawn and went through the guards like mincemeat, heads and limbs flying left and right. At the same time, some fool on the walls thought it was a good idea to let loose ballistae upon a mass of thousands of civilians. At the front men tried to push back, whereas the armed men at the back tried to push forward. The bloodshed was inescapable despite Clergy calling for an immediate stop along with the charismatic Fellhurt, and then a heavy bolt hit him in the chest. Barely breathing he was carried off to safety, and another threshold was reached. A brawl turned into a massacre, hundreds dying in minutes. Though holy fire of the mind propelled men beyond human limitations they simply could not try to assault the city, and eventually they were pushed back. As it was clear they had to retreat, many men stood and fought, foretelling what was to happen moments later. As folk ran back the men on the walls fired with crossbows wave after wave of bolts into the backs of the people with blood flowing like a river down the streets. As Konrad might watch the events from his Castle, he would just for a moment see a man on the roof of one of the buildings look straight at him, tip a tall hat in mocking and then disappear. With his bird\u2019s eye view, he would be able to see the country slowly starting to burn\u2026.</br></div>"}}
