The land was renamed by Soult to match his former fiefdom in Gauldin.\u00a0Vast swathes of the Annais forest, particularly those parts along the mountains, were granted to the orc tribes that traveled with the Duke from his homeland. They are ruled in a loose confederation of tribes, the only thing keeping them from warring amongst themselves too violently is their chieftains' oaths of loyalty to the Duke. The forests remain relatively untamed, warning signs posted to those who would stray into orc territory.\u00a0The City of Brais was rebuilt and established as the capital of the Duchy, and houses the Duke's Keep. New roads were built or expanded on to link Brais with the rest of Rondon, and the Duke is constantly seeking those who can bring more industry, more development, more money and more jobs to his lands.\u00a0Dreigh is currently being rebuilt from the ground up. A massive investment into its infrastructure is underway, as the Duke desires it to function as a port for Arcoux. The beginnings of a bridge can be seen piled along the shore, ready to be constructed when the workers are done on the docks. The horrific tragedy that occurred here is being swept away, built over and buried. A memorial to those who fell was the first thing constructed in the new town, and is currently the only permanently installed structure in the town.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://imgur.com/FXIDF0m.jpg"], "html": "In the aftermath of the Rondon-Zephyr War, nearly half of the former Zephyrite territory was granted to Duke Nicolas Soult, in honor of his great service during the conflict.
