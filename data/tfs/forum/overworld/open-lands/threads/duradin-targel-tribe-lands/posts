The orcs here value tradition and practice above all else, following the mindset that power over oneself lends power over others. The Targel often don bandages and linen cloths to minimize the weight on themselves along with providing protection for their muscles during combat. Their tribe is found nestled in a valley in the Southern mountains.Chieftain Morvo of Targel:Morvo is large in stature and heart, welcoming orcs from all walks of life into his tribe, so long as they have the will to improve. He feels that everyone has room to better themselves in combat and in mind. Morvo is considered the second wisest of the orcs of Duradin.Targel, the Enlightened Tribe, is looking to make trade routes and allies with cities along its southern borders.A sealed scroll has been sent out to each of the nearby holds and cities that are South of Targel. It is written four times; once in Orcish, once in English/Common, once in Elven, and again in Dwarven. The letter essentially requests the alliance of those nearby to make trade with Targel. It excludes any mention of war benefits or political matters, only wishing to start the bridges for the common health and welfare of the civilians and the supplies for such. Should you be a person of importance for a hold that is South of Duradin, Morvo humbly awaits your response.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/1UwNkOg.jpg"], "html": "<b><font size=\"4\">Targel, the Enlightened Tribe</font></b>"}}
