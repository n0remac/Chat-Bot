Despite the rough, straight lines making the art, it was clear the woman was a very beautiful lady and high of stature; along the bottom most part of the wall were rough and terrain that might resemble bones.The right was something a bit more imposing a design - rows and rows of dingo dogs, also decorated in gold and white silks this time, stood much like an army in wait.

The hall seemed to go on forever, with more etchings of desert serpents and black cobras - dead men lying on the ground, poisoned and wallowing in pools of venom, a woman repeatedly seen with a black cobra and a curved dagger-like blade in her hand. It was disturbing, even in the rough etched fashion drawn in the walls. The story continued until a man with an eagle's head appeared and stood larger, taller than her. She cowered beneath his hand. The snakes receded from him. And the woman was cast off. A cobra writhed. There was a pyramid, and in the heart of it was a small pedestal with a gem or item settled atop it? The pedestal was depicted alone with that black cobra circled around it, now no longer just a snake but bearing a headdress much like the one of the woman, set with a flawlessly cut amethyst gem and the object missing from its resting place on said pedestal.The story ended there, as did the hall - dropping off into a wide, rounded pit. The steps that led down into the bottom of the bowl of this room were worn, but the first one was broken. Likely to cause an accident if someone was too engrossed in the story. But here, in this chamber, were mounds of shimmering gold and gems of amethyst and sapphire, lavishing furniture for a god wrought in gold and stone. Silk draperies were worn and withered but still elegant. And... snakes. Hundreds of sand-bound serpents were slithering everywhere and draped over almost everything. Seemingly normal, and undisturbed by visitors that might enter. Instead, stepping into the chamber they would disperse to reveal safe placement to step - and not a single one would bite, despite how menacing some might be.Sitting in the center of the room was that very pedestal, the place atop with an empty slot for whatever was supposed to sit there. There were more scriptures along the vertical length of the monument, perhaps a spelling of some sort. It was the same on all four sides.Across the room, on a platform low in the curved floor of the chamber, was a massive bed still made up night despite how age had touched it.

He was massive, skin dark as before but built like a man - a giant. The head was massive and still the head of the dog it had been before. He was dressed much like Wadjet, adorn in gold and jewels but in cotton wraps rather than white silk. His eyes were alight, and malicious - further instilled when the maw parted slightly to reveal the deadly teeth set within.
