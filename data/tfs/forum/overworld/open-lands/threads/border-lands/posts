The undesirables, the bad elements, the mercenaries who keep demanding more pay? Why you get rid of them, of course! You send them to the one place they can't cause any trouble; out of sight, out of mind... You send them to...The Border LandsA quaint and quite charming place, The Border Lands encompass a medium-sized region that borders the edge of a certain kingdom's territory. There are no cities or major towns, no major infrastructures and no real military presence... Just a few villages, spots of woodland and a few tiny fortifications long-abandoned and in a state of disrepair.\u00a0It has no known strategic importance, few valuable resources and the people seem decades behind those of other regions of the kingdom when it comes to modernity. And yet... Its distance from any major location means that slowly but surely, bandits, monsters and other troublemakers are becoming rife - lawlessness is on the rise and it doesn't seem to be getting any better.\u00a0And so the King decided to use The Border Lands to hit two birds with one stone. They would answer the calls for aid of the region's inhabitants, as well as cull the army of the most undesirable elements and mercenaries by sending them down to the border lands with only one instruction: \"keep the king's peace\".

The sun hangs low in the sky, painting the wispy clouds that drift lazily by in lovely shades of pink and orange. It's as if the gods themselves have made the sky their canvas. Below, the natural world is peaceful and undisturbed. Songbirds sing their evening songs to one another as they prepare to hunker down for the night. The yipping of a coyote can be heard somewhere off in the distance, and the gentle buzz of night insects begins to fill the air. The air hangs heavy and humid, putting a damper on an otherwise glorious night, retaining the day's heat and sticking to flesh and cloth alike.Despite the charming setting, one of its inhabitants appears rather upset. A small gnomish woman with slightly green-tinged tanned skin and a long ponytail of smooth brunette hair stands on a high mesa, looking down a magnified sight on the end of her outlandish crossbow, searching the planes for...something. She perks up as she apparently finds it, and bounds down the side of the mesa, spry as a billy goat, her teeth bared in an almost predatory grin. She dives behind a nearby hill and crawls up its side, prone. When she caps the hill she sees it: the prize she's searched so long for, wasting the entire day spotting. A caravan, full of rough-looking burly men accompanied by two gold-laden wagons rolls along the main road before pulling off to the base of the gnome's hill to set up camp.\"Perfect,\" whispers Tinker to herself as she aims down the sight, marking the positions of each of the men in her mind as they go about setting up the camp. She counts a total of twelve. Twelve men for twenty-four thousand crowns? And mere ruffians at that? Definitely worth the few days it took to track them down, certainly. She wipes a bead of sweat from her forehead and waits for the camp to settle into its routine, patient and motionless as a lion ready to spring upon its prey.By the time the camp is completed, the sun has fallen beneath the horizon, and the stars have begun to peek out from behind the clouds, glimmering like fairy dust in the deep blue sky, glowing in rivers of celestial glory that stretch and wind across the night sky. The near-full moon casts its dim glow upon the lands, but the serenity its gentle light brings will not last long. Not, at least, for the men that set their tents below. Abruptly, the torch of one of the men falls to the ground with a muffled thump. Then another. And another. The gnome is nearly silent as she takes out her prey one after another, and it's too late before the bandits notice their predicament as one of her bolts whizzes past her mark's ear. His shouts are cut off by a steel bolt protruding from his jugular, but not before the remaining four bandits are put on alert. The gnome curses her own sloppiness, and stands up to run as the four men make their way toward her hiding spot, following the trajectory of the fired bolts. She'll have to take up a new position.
