From above, one would see roads and alleys placed almost randomly throughout the hundreds of food carts, caf\u00e9s and otherwise sprawling bazaars.

Each building's floorpan and layout is unique, be it the fountain in the entryway or the spices and tangy fruits drying on the rooftops. An intricate port runs along the edge of Miraji that faces towards the Lienid Isles and the open ocean. This area is constantly patrolled by Lienid warships, as the abundance of merchants provide easy targets for foreign pirates.

And from its countless walkways and parapets bled the colors of Arridi, spilling in a mess of red and gold down the sheer faces of the large building. The colossal keep was constructed of a material the pair of foreigners could not quite recognize. The texture and color were much akin to sandstone, yet upon touch, it was apparent that the matter was something of another nature. Contrary to what one would assume to be the entryway into the impressive structure, a large seemingly metal slab was the only form of an entrance which the pair could see. Upon closer inspection, one might notice that the slab presented no crease or evidence of an opening. The Arridi paused for a moment, giving no hint as to how the group would enter the large keep, instead, leaving it to the foreigners' imagination. Soon afterward a large rumbling began, and before the eyes of the two travelers, the large slab slowly began to sink into the desert sands. At first, one would have thought it was their imagination working tricks on their mind, yet soon afterward, it was apparent that the decent of the slab had presented an opening into the keep, in which the Arridi entered. The next moments would be a blur of hurriedly walking through a maze of empty corridors and bustling halls. Each room was different than the last. Though Audric and Cassandra would have no time to marvel at each sight as the Arridi briskly disappeared into the next corridor, motioning for the pair to follow. Eventually, the group would reach a large oaken door, which the Arridi opened to reveal a large apartment. Surprisingly, as the foreigners entered the space, a cool wave of fresh air would spill over the pair. It was a refreshing sensation after countless hours in the scorching desert sun. The room itself was modest, filled with a small round table, at which sat three wooden chairs. Glancing upwards, one would notice a slight curve to the ceiling, periodically supported by wooden rafters. Beams of light filtered through from the small windows which periodically interrupted the walls. Along the back wall lay another table though upon this piece of furniture lay a countless number of exotic fruits and a large glass pitcher filled with a clear liquid that resembled water. Clearly the liquid was chilled as condensation on the pitcher was apparent. Beside it stood a pair of crystal glasses, both already filled with the refreshing beverage, along with two wooden platters clearly for the foreign fruits. The Arridi finally spoke, \"The Wakir will be with you in a moment, in the meanwhile, please take whatever you need.\" The man grinned at the pair of foreigners and continued. \"I do hope our paths cross again, to has been pleasant.\" Before turning around and exiting the room, the man touched his right hand to his lips, then forehead, then lips again, in what the pair could only assume was a gesture of farewell.
