What kind of a dolt wore shawls in the middle of summer? Ones with something to hide usually. And ones that were talking to him apparently. Evelar listened to the muffled question from the man and considered his options. He could give a simple answer, -No, nope, haven\u2019t seen here good-day my friend, i\u2019ll be on my way- something simple as that. He felt the satchel on his ankle press into his bone like a little kid tugging at your pants to remind you that it requires attention. It would be unwise to get into some sort of muddle now. But then again, the stranger didn\u2019t know he had anything of value on him, and his burden was concealed well. He debated for a moment longer before his curiosity won out in the end. He would have a little discussion with this traveler, see what came of it. \u201cHail fellow traveler.
