As she lays upon the pallet, one vision in particular seems to make her writhe and mewl with fright, though not intensely enough to scare Jean-Claude away. She stands upon a beach upon the island that us her home, gazing across the channel to its sister land on the other side. Resplendent Quetzals, a bright green and blue bird of paradise, flutter overhead, and a gentle sea breeze stirs Acolyte K'talon's ceremonial garb, very immodest yet still gorgeous, consisting of a tight wooden bodice -- with painted designs abstractly depicting Thrarrel's triumph of the former evil Sun God whose name shall not be spoken -- and a long, wide loincloth that just barely brushes against the ground when she stands, the string tying both sides together adorned with feathers. Beneath the golden feathered veil that lies over her mouth, she smiles. Perhaps being a priestess would not be so bad.A large, black-striped panther-like cat man appears behind her and wraps his arms about her shoulders, giving her ear a little nibble.\"Are you ready for the ceremony, my sweet?\" he asks. Flash forward an hour later, and there Rarraennan stands, before the sacred flame of the Morning Star, hands raised before her. Her golden jewelry shines in the light of the massive brazier, matching those of the three other priestesses of Thrarrel being inducted that day. Cynder knows that only one can survive the Trial of the Morning Star; the other three will be sacrificed to Thrarrel in return for his life-giving light.The flame licks at the hands of all the catwomen, but ultimately, it wraps about the priestess to Rarraennan's right, and her heart fills with dread. It had not chosen her. Thrrarrel had chosen another. She would be sacrificed, and given to Thrrarrel to live in the sky as a beacon of light in the dreaded void. A more honourable death could not be asked for, yet...Rarraennan does not wish to die.Flash forward to the next morning. Rarraennan says a tearful goodbye to her mother and father, and gives her lover one final kiss before leaving for the Ziggurat that will inevitably be her grave. Yet, she never arrives. For that fateful day, foreign prospectors arrive upon her island, and take her away. Her freedom has been taken, yet her life spared. Thrrarrel will not be pleased, but surely he will understand? Rarraennan's heart fills with relief and dread in equal measure.

His teeth chattered so violently that he was afraid he might accidentally bite his tongue off if he tried to speak. Not that there was anyone to speak to. The few travelers he had seen had all but ignored him.\u00a0 \u00a0He simply hoped to escape the cartel-run alleys and dives of Bayonne. To not have to run from both the law and the criminals just to survive. To find a place where his status meant nothing. He knew they were all vain hopes -- there was no such place in this world. Still, he stumbled onward unsure of where he was even headed or if he'd even make it.\u00a0 \u00a0Eventually, when he could walk no more, he stumbled and finally sat down next to a large boulder that looked as though it had been in its place since the road's construction. There was a large pool of clean rain water in the grass near it, and he bent his face down to drink from it. It was then that he heard voices and laughing from further down the road. The rain wasn't heavy, but enough so that his tired eyes had a difficult time focusing on the source. It looked like two, maybe three men in heavy cloaks, maybe armored. He tried to scrabble out of sight, to the other side of the boulder.\u00a0 \u00a0As the men drew nearer, he heard one of them say to the others, \"hey, what's that? Some poor wretch way out here?\" The men circled around him laughing amongst themselves. Even through the rain, Efrik could smell the drink on them. Efrik looked up through loose knots of his own hair and saw the men for what they really were: brigands. Their armor was patchwork at best, scraggly beards smeared onto dirty faces, and old swords now visible under their cloaks, probably looted from the bodies of a battleground somewhere.\u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, what's wrong boy,\" one of the others half-yelled. \"Devil take your tongue?\" The three burst into laughter again.\u00a0 \u00a0The first nudged Efrik hard in the ribs with the point of boot. \"Answer the man, shit eater,\" he yelled loud enough to hurt Efrik's ears.\u00a0 \u00a0\"Aww hell, this poor bastard isn't even worth it,\" said the third. \"We gotta get to Bayonne by tomorrow night, let's get moving\"\u00a0 \u00a0\"We got plenty of time,\" the first replies. \"Let's have a little fun with this fucker.\" He brings his foot back and kicks Efrik in the thigh hard enough that it immediately cramps from a combination of the blow and exhaustion. The three laugh again as Efrik howls in pain.\u00a0 \u00a0Unable to move his leg now, Efrik starts trying to crawl away from the three, but the wet grass and exhaustion all but prevent him from getting far. Another boot collides with him, this time just under the ribs in the back, likely bruising a kidney in the process if not breaking a rib or two. Efrik can't breathe now, let alone cry out in pain. He falls into the puddle, face first. Just before his face hits the water, he sees a reflection of his current self. Soaked, hair knotted and caked with mud, eyes a dull yellow laced with red streaks, face knotted up in the visage of pure agony.

He finally figured it did not matter what he told her, or anyone for that matter.

Of course, he did not like that so I had to overthrow him. That's another long story.

How odd that someone could think about becoming a ruler as so...unimportant, simply glossing over it like that. Still, the rest of his story is intriguing. She nods slowly as he speaks, resting her elbow on her knee as she shifts in her seat before the fire, those icy blue eyes locking upon his, studying him.Once he's finished, she sighs and nods slowly.\"As you wish. I will tell you of myself, though I expect you will like me less once it is done. Such a thing is inevitable. As you know, I am a Fletcher. Our family is large and widespread, and contains many different kinds of people. If you can believe it, I was once a fiery young lass, with a hair trigger temper. I will not bore you with the finer details, but the long and the short of it is that I nearly killed a cousin of mine and ran away from home, seeking to run away from my problems rather than confront them.\"As a child I had trained in two-handed sword techniques nearly incessantly, and so it was fairly easy for me to find work as a mercenary in the employ of the Order of the Hammer, as a Knight-errant. This position allowed me to travel far and wide, meeting new people and experiencing new things. All of it was simply material of course, meaningless. I only figured that out once I met the Cult of the Void Black Priest in my travels, and he introduced me to the tenants of his religion. I joined quickly, and pledged my soul to The Void. The rest is...well, I have done many things men would call 'heroic', and amassed much wealth, but I don't use it often. This life is meaningless and empty. The only thing that matters is The Void,\" she says, averting her eyes and looking up at the stars intently.

That victim was a black, humanesque shape that was falling quickly towards the countryside. Head first, it spun as it plunged, faster and faster.The first thing that Damon remembered as he approached the ground was being able to smell salt in the air, and that was what told him he wasn't dead. He hated\u00a0the ocean. There wasn't the slimmest that it would feature in his afterlife. As he dropped, he kept his eyes closed, and his arms and legs tightly clasped against his body as he spun, his head down. He was well aware that he would feel violently ill the moment he opened his eyes, so he was content to hold off as he approached the hard earth beneath him, while opening his mind to view quite how he looked falling through the air, and how close he was to his impact point. He was pleased to note that that was something that still worked as he watched with morbid fascination as he neared what would cause a mortal instant death from impact. Finally, at what seemed to be the last moment, when he was less than a hundred metres from the ground, his telepathic scrying ended, his eyes snapped open, and his hands and boots blazed in a blue light, enabling himself to flip feet-first, so that the contact point was no longer going to be his head. As he neared, closer and closer, the shining symbol of his magic surged, and he rapidly slowed, before touching down gently on the ground. 'Well, that was fun,' he remarked to himself, before looking around to try and identify where he was. He recognised none of the geography, and so reached the logical conclusion that he'd been thrown through dimensions, one of the very few borders he could not cross. 'Damn. Damn it all.' Resolving himself to find the nearest civilisation so he could find out more about this world he now inhabited, and also perhaps find something to eat. He was ravenous\u00a0for some decent food.

You can't sneak a peak at death, you either face it head on or it catches you unawares. Isn't that just the way of things? Although the battle still rages, the sound becomes dull muted. Or perhaps it was just his concentration slipping, after all how does one focus on anything when death is beside you?<br/><br/>\"<font size=\"1\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">NEITHER YOU ARE SIMPY BETWEEN ONE BEAT AND THE NEXT.

Death stands next to regal, Death watches the dead die again. The battle like a flame that once burned hot begins to die down. The last soldier rams his spear through his last enemy, before dropping to his knees. Three arrows stick out of his back, black feathers on black shafts drawing crimson blood. The soldier collapses and the last of his flesh fades away, the arrows snap or they were always snapped. Regal is struck by another terrible realization as he stares down at the field. It is the same.

Although they could stick him in the carriage and head off to the nearest tavern she thought he needed a bit more immediate medical care. She also knew the perfect person for administering such care. Ordering her driver to take over assisting the man eating and drinking, Grandma begin channeling as she paces about. A number of square clumps of dirt are pulled up from the side of the road and float over to in front of the carriage. The cubes were perfect, unnaturally so for pieces of dirt pulled from the ground. After just a moment, lines would begin appearing on the cubes, as if drawn by an invisible hand.Still, this process would take a bit of time as Grandma didn\u2019t feel any particular need to rush it. Her ritual in motion, Grandma walks back over to the injured man, checking if he has a fever or any other injuries. If she finds any, she does what she can to disinfect them and bind them with a bandage.\u201cThere is nothing to worry about, we shall be traveling to a place you can get proper medical care to shortly.

Carriage slowing to a stop, Grandma peered out the window and managed to make out the form of a man lying at the side of the road.<br/><br/>Her driver leaped down and opened the door of the carriage for her as she climbed out and made her way over to the figure, motioning for the driver to stay with the carriage. Leaning over the disheveled man, she checked to see if he still lived. Although nearly dead from the look of it, he seemed to be desperately clinging to life.<br/><br/>\u201cCan you hear me, son?\u201d Grandma spoke in a kindly voice and although she didn\u2019t necessarily expect a response from the man, she watched to see if his eyes moved at all or showed any recognition of her presence. While waiting for any sign that he could notice her, Grandma ordered the driver to bring over some blankets along with food and drink.<br/><br/>However, Grandma wasn\u2019t acting out of pure altruism, she could sense <i>something</i> about this man. She couldn\u2019t put her finger on it, but something was different. Regardless, he intrigued her. <br/><div class=\"quote_clear\"></div></br></div></div> He couldn't speak. He signalled to her that he was alive by shifting his eyes back-and-forth.<br/><br/>Help. Help his arrived. Food. He could eat. He wouldn't die. He was practically euphoric. He smiled weakly, barely managing to even do that. He couldn't see who had helped him. The voice sounded old, but in his tired state he couldn't discern the gender of his savior. This person appeared just a black blob above him. He could just make out the carriage behind this person. They must be rich, or an aristocrat. Then why didn't they recognise him, as Ancalagon? The sheep-eater. <br/><br/>That was easy to answer, since he was in his humanoid form. <br/><br/>He could sense something anout this mysterious figure, a They hadn't purely helped due to his exhausted state. There was some ulterior motive behind this. He couldn't do anything about it. And he couldn't tell what it was.<div class=\"quote_clear\"></div></div></div>"}, "post-46604": {"user": "Alden Marshal", "user_num": 794, "timestamp": "1471390322000", "message": "(The Minotaur - @darron)Darron's blow lands on the iron of The Minotaur's vambrace.

Mid dash, the Kiggy soon found a blade piercing through his throat which began to spurt and drip dark red blood down his scales.

The Kobold made a gurgling sound through all the blood and tried to look up at his killer as the life quickly faded from the creature's face.The bandit who was struck first now clambered back up onto his feet, one hand applying pressure to the cut as blood seeped through, the other hand hold his sword in a defensive posture. He took two paces backwards, he still needed a bit of time to recover and control his wound.The three were very anxious to see how much money the boy was offering, that is, until he started winding it up in rapid circles. Within the short period, none of them had much time to react to the hurtling metal balls. Legion Master Zhax  went wide eyed as the metallic object soared at his face. Xin 's shots (mostly) struck true, the pellet designed for Legion Master Zhax  cracked on the topside of his head, luckily angled well enough to not crush his skull, but bonked him instead. He went out cold as his eyes shut and crumpled down onto the ground, soundly sleeping in the dirt. His female Gnoll companion on Legion Master Zhax 's left was smacked right in the stomach with a metal ball, luckily her torso was armored and the impact would only knock the wind out of her with a yelp, stun her for the moment, and likely leave a bruise. The wild shots at the right side Kiggy missed or did superficial damage, only glancing off the armor or surface of the scales. Before any weapons could be drawn by the only non-hurt bandit, @sione  and Xin  were off running away! Angrily, the lone standing Kiggy wildly threw a javelin at them as they ran, but it was an unlikely hit. However, his attention would then quickly turn to Legion Master Zhax , who was potentially injured. He crouched down next to his fallen leader, using one arm to hold up Legion Master Zhax 's unconscious head while the other felt around his body, looking for his pulse. Inspection would eventually reveal that he was indeed alive and deeply snoring.No longer worried about his commander's condition, he would gently let Legion Master Zhax slump back down in a bush and position his limbs into a more comfortable posture for laying on the forested floor. Legion Master Zhax looked rather peaceful for once with shut eyes and still limbs as his chest visibly heaved up and down, if he wasn't mindlessly mumbling and drooling on the ground.

While he was an accomplished fighter, and he had much better equipment than what these bandits had, numbers was definitely a problem.1. She hadn't anticipated that the man would take the risk of possibly losing his opponent underfoot to strike at her, but luckily her shield barely went up mid charge before it landed. The sheer force of the sword impacting the thin wood shield would splinter it into multiple pieces and also sent its user forcefully toppling headfirst into a tree trunk a few meters away. With a satisfying thunk, she crumpled down at the base of the tree before slumping backwards onto the ground.2. With the short moment his grasp was released, the Gnoll dropped her weapons at her sides and put out her hands to try and stop the crushing boot of Demetrius Elantine . Her strength was enough to slow it, but the initial impact would still cause her to be knocked out as her arms collapsed to her sides and her head and face were pinned between a boot and the earth. Ages of war-like tendencies among these Gnolls helped them develop stronger adaptations to keep them alive, such as thicker skulls, but the soft brain inside however, could still be knocked around.3. This Kiggy was not liking his odds and was debating running from the scene. He'd need to get the word out otherwise the rest would never hear back from any of them. More importantly, he didn't want to die today, not here! Rather than entangling himself in the duel, he turned to flee for the edge of the forest.4. The final standing opponent was another Gnoll, she was equipped with a sword and shield. Steadily but quickly closing the gap with the shield at the ready. When she was close enough, using the momentum of her approach and her strength, she bashed his side with the shield, looking to topple or weaken his stance.5.

All of these creatures looked dirty and barbaric with their shoddy gear, but still exhibited a proper way to communicate and a ranking system.From the center of this warband emerged what appeared to be the leader, a rather stocky Kiggy, flanked by three higher ranking and better equipped troops on each side. He had the rest stay back as he navigated the woodland floor to get within speaking distance of @noah. He had a cloth wrap going around the top of his head and under his chin, presumably to treat some injury. \"You teh man who's gonna be after the punk's 'ead?!?\" He shouted, still closing the distance between the assassin as they pushed through the natural underbrush.", "link_list": ["/post/59893/thread"], "image_list": ["//storage.proboards.com/6046952/images/uCQvKjMwQCSfGa7d4dCT.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@noah\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/59893/thread\" timestamp=\"1485842264\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-0\" title=\"noah\"><img alt=\"noah Avatar\" src=\"//storage.proboards.com/6046952/images/uCQvKjMwQCSfGa7d4dCT.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/59893/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1485842264000\" title=\"Jan 30, 2017 21:57:44 GMT -8\">Jan 30, 2017 21:57:44 GMT -8</abbr></a>  @noah said:</div>Noah would wait patiently as he saw the creature scurry away.

Badger still didn't look back as he continued to pump his legs, pushing himself faster as he gripped his small blade.

Small, but muscular, it would seem that the one remaining guard might have underestimated how quickly the gnome could move, especially given that he was running for his life. Badger felt the whack of the bandit's broad blade, but probably lower on his neck than the bandit intended (since the swing likely had a downward angle given the height difference in the two), and with less force since Badger was already traveling away from his guards.The small gnome indeed may be quickly overpowered, but it would only be after the was caught. Badger still didn't look back as he continued to pump his legs, pushing himself faster as he gripped his small blade. He hoped that whomever was tasked with watching him would be too tied up with the bigger game of the magical halfling to run down a 'crazy knife-wielding gnome'.Quite disappointed that his hit did minimal effect, he still kept on the gnome's tail but gave him a little distance. He slowed his pace a bit, letting the shortie wear himself out a following him from a distance. He chased Badger into the treeline, hoping with the branches, sticks and other objects, that the gnome would trip and fall. The bandit assumed his target would fatigue or faint from the exertion or the adrenaline fading away, then he could easily catch up and grab him.", "link_list": ["/post/60680/thread", "/post/60697/thread", "/user/2100"], "image_list": ["//storage.proboards.com/6046952/images/uCQvKjMwQCSfGa7d4dCT.jpg", "//storage.proboards.com/6046952/avatar/HvqbvNpNaxUyVxRgb0hd.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@quis\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/60680/thread\" timestamp=\"1488302952\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-0\" title=\"quis\"><img alt=\"quis Avatar\" src=\"//storage.proboards.com/6046952/images/uCQvKjMwQCSfGa7d4dCT.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/60680/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1488302952000\" title=\"Feb 28, 2017 9:29:12 GMT -8\">Feb 28, 2017 9:29:12 GMT -8</abbr></a>  @quis said:</div>Turning her attention towards the two bandits charging her, she pointed at the closest one and let loose a thunderstorm of electricity into him, the booming crack of thunder filling the air as his body was forced backward by the shock.

Ugh, why did chasing one guy into a forest have to be so complicated? Badger was mostly safe from harm, for now.

The incoming slash on would be blocked by the bandit stepping to his right, placing the slash now on his left side with the shield, and angled and pushed the shield against her strike and moved her sword outside and away from his body. Now with her body open, the kobold could do a wide flat strike against her hip. However the sheer amount of armor would likely render that attack to do minimal damage, not too much more than a bruise or temporary shock from the impact if it landed.Two of the six new bandits that were backing the solo fighter up now took up position far to the left and right of their comrade, almost nearly surrounding Arya Shieldheart. The one on her far right was a rather large looking male gnoll armed with a mace and a shield, and the one on her far left was a female kiggy/kobold whom had hammer and a parrying blade at the ready.

In that same moment, however, the other kobold would land her attack upon the paladin's knee. This attack would dent the armor, and make it difficult to move that joint.The impaled bandit had the sword in his gut wrenched out, and the bleeding increased. His arms went limp as he slowly fell towards Arya Shieldheart   \u2019s feet. As the blood casually pooled  around his cold body on the forest floor, it was quite clear that he was officially deceased. A goblin wielding a short spear and shield was behind him and would take up his dead friend\u2019s position soon.The right side gnoll did not expect the paladin to use magic to speed herself up to evade his attack, and also to try striking him down low with extreme speed. His shield was nowhere near her sword arm, and thus, could not use it to defend himself, he would have to rely on the scattered bits of random armor on his legs. Luckily, Arya\u2019s sword would definitely connect, but the gnolls generally wore heavier armor than the other races, her sword would meet against a small square of chainmail. Her sword lacked the power to split the mail, but because of her strong swipe and the gnoll\u2019s balance being up so high, his legs were knocked away from under him and he\u2019d be left with a bruise. He partially rolled midair, causing him to land on his back with a grunt. Physically, he was mostly unharmed, but for the moment he was stunned, vulnerable and trapped on the ground.The kobold on the right had no resistance incoming from the woman, and thus, she continued her assault without hesitation. She remained to keeping her profile and defensive stance down low, but only raised her hammer above herself. She made a downwards strike, aiming to bash in Arya Shieldheart   \u2019s shoulder-pad. This attack was more well prepped and stronger than the last one, but the desired effect was the same. Should it do maximum damage, it could possibly dislocate the lady paladin\u2019s shoulder, and jam the armor in place, but that was only if there was no defense made by Arya Shieldheart   .The rearmost ranged goblin took his shot once the middle kobold had fallen, and the shot was clear. He had set his sights to hopefully connect with her center mass. He\u2019d then begin loading another bolt into his weapon.The male kobold behind the male gnoll had sheathed his sword and took out an odd ceramic pot with runes of anti-magic engraved on it, once he noticed the reflex and speed increasing effect was her spell.

With his other hand that was still technically within striking range, he swiped with his shield/mace (doesn\u2019t matter too much, desired effect is the same) at her the back or the side of her shins, hopefully putting her down on the ground with the combined impact of the spear.Surprised by Arya Shieldheart \u2019s quick grab, she lost her balance and stumbled towards her foe. She attempted to stab the parrying blade into one of her joints, but her accuracy was very poor while she was off balance. There was not much difficulty in jabbing the blade into the bandits flesh. Her knees fell limp as she began to choke on her own blood and lost grip of both of her weapons. Barely alive, (and for not much longer) she was thrown over and on top of her comrade on the ground, bleeding on him as she went quiet and shut her eyes, silently begging for mercy.The goblin had just finished loading a narrower bolt, hopefully better equipped to deal with the heavier armor that Arya Shieldheart  donned. He took aim again, this time slightly lower in the torso.The two supporting each respective flank tossed their odd pots at Arya, one threw it directly at her face, the other immediately at the ground. Each jar contained a poisonous gas from in a magical swamp which caused burning of the lungs when one inhaled it and irritation of the eyes when it connected. It also was enchanted to possess the effects of antimagic in it\u2019s area, causing Arya Shieldheart  to no longer be able to use her magic. They would shatter on impact, releasing a thick green swirling smoke that climbed towards her face.

The lifeless body, her armor and his own armor would stop the sword from piercing all the way through, preventing injury to the gnoll on the bottom. The woman's sword did easily penetrate the gnoll's meatshield's armor and flesh but it could not make it all the way through. He did however feel the impact of the increased weight, and he was caught off guard and was unable to do anything else for the moment as he slowly also suffered the effects of the gas.When Arya Shieldheart   started to limp away and disengage from the rest, it gave the female gnoll a perfect charge angle on the fleeing paladin. Sprinting towards Arya, she raised the club over her shoulder, and did a downwards leaping attack through the smoke towards her head and back. Her chances of hitting and doing damage were good, as Arya was open to attack, and the blunt trauma could ignore most of her armor.The goblin at the back stopped shooting.

The terrible claws on her fingers could easily peel off and grab flesh from the smaller, weaker being's skull, but the worst part is that her sharpened claws would meet any of her facial cavities that @mirssa  could grab. If she got any claws in or near @quis 's eyes, nose, or mouth, (which are all protected/shielded by nothing but air) she'd squeeze with her left hand without mercy for the poor halfling's life at the moment, gouging out or crushing any unfortunate part of her face that grappled by her hand. (Which hopefully would also interrupt/cancel the magic spell she was casting, as it's hard to use magic while you're bleeding out of your eyeballs and impaled through your mouth.)The falchion in her right hand would be moved to @quis  side (parallel to the ground) and was wound away from the side of the halfling's torso, with the tip of it pointed at her kidney area, would be prepared in a moment to stab her internal organs once it had enough force prepared behind it. While falchions were not known for good stabbing attacks, the tip would likely still be sharp enough to pierce the halfling's next to nothing armor, and even if it couldn't the stab itself would still hurt and probably stun her.

However, the mage's final attempts to possibly save herself would be her own (and @mirssa's) downfall, literally. The gnoll's claws were still brutally wedged in the halfling's eye sockets and mouth, her fingers went deep enough to mince and skewer the frontal lobe of the brain, effectively rendering Quis braindead, unable to act at all. Mirssa kept her claw wedged in her skull, with her other hand she dropped her sword, as she wouldn't need it for the next few minutes as she free falled.

The halfling had a potion that glinted in the sun, while @mirssa was no alchemist, she did know what miracles some potions could achieve. Retrieving the potion from her foe's belt with her free hand, she clutched it closely to her torso, not letting it slip. She tried to wiggle her hand out of the halfling's skull, before kicking her body away from her as the fell, eventually losing sight of her in the distance.@mirssa still had time to fall, she looked around through the wind, and tried to take in the sights before she splattered. There were worse ways to go, and she knew she won, first, at least.As she could begin to make out individual trees, she uncapped and drank most of whatever the potion she'd taken. She hoped it was one of featherfall, but it looked like healing, even if it was some sort of poison or negative effect, not like it'd last long.

Nat'ia  sensed that now was a good time to strike, as they were stopped, distracted and bunched up with whomever they were addressing. The large bandit group of creatures moved quickly through the woodland plant life, with Nat'ia  leading the makeshift group of a dozen kobolds, gnolls and goblins towards them.The trio would hear the brushing of underbrush from many individuals behind Jin  and Aery  about twelve or fourteen meters away. As they turned to look however, they would hear the creak of multiple bowstrings being pulled and the whirl of slings whipping above it\u2019s users\u2019 heads. The raiders had rushed forward rapidly with their ranged weapons at the ready but had also had done their best to remain quiet as they got close. Now they pointed their (weak paralyzing) poison arrow tips towards the three of them with their bows drawn, and the sling users had readied their pouches with ammunition, small engraved ceramic pots of noxious gas. They would see approximately 15 (Nat'ia  included) of miscellaneous bandits of various savage races equipped with lighter leather or cloth armors, wielding basic steel or iron weapons of different styles. In the center of their line was Nat'ia  with her own bow, who could possibly be made out as the leader because she was slightly larger and better equipped than the other 14 of her troops. Hopefully the three of them (Jin , Aery, @josidiah ) would stop dead in their tracks when they saw how many were pointing their deadly ammunition towards them.Nat'ia , the center most female kobold, was quick to speak from behind her bow, as it was likely either her units or they were not going to want to be friendly to each other for much longer. Her voice was quite rough and cold but still had a decent sense of clear pronunciation, (even if her grammar was still quite bad) something that one would expect from a older dragon with something in their throat and less intimidating.\u201cYou best put down them weapons and pointy thingz, if you wanna live through any of this.

Winter had come and gone, but the cool, crisp air remained for now.  The sun started to rise and glistened off the dew droplets covering the grassy fields.  The horses neighed and faithfully carried their white-clad owners down the beaten path, heading westward.  They crossed hills and rounded small, rocky outcroppings before stopping near a small stream.Heinrich and his allies dismounted; mail armor clinked as they led their barded white steeds to the river to drink.  The water was cool and refreshing, and was required for the ongoing journey; the Brothers refilled their casks.  Heinrich, the senior member of this small bunch, was patrolling the Open Road for bandits, vagabonds, and other ne'er-do-wells.  There was the occasional night-terror which had to be vanquished, but for the most part the Knight-Brothers handled their affairs well.  All was quiet elsewhere, as far as Brotherhood business goes.  Adrian, the former Hochmeister, had visited Vessia and seemingly went dark, not to be heard from again.  There were no posts assigned to Heinrich at the moment, and so he led his company throughout the Overworld, assisting the innocent folk in all the in-between locations otherwise left unprotected by the rest of the world.\"That'll be enough,\" Heinrich said to his men.  \"Mount up.  We ride.\"  The Knights did as they were ordered, re-mounting their steeds.  The hooves of their horses splashed in the stream as they made their way down the road again.The area was largely flat, with the occasional hill, lake, or river.  Small, independent forests dotted the landscape, but they were not particularly dense.

Anyways, it was about the right season for squash, so I decided to take a walk through the farms and see if any of the farmers would sell me one for dinner. As I was walking through, I saw this group of kids. Such a strange group, too. One of them held a blanket, another was absolutely filthy, and yet another had the roundest head I'd ever seen...and their dog. Ugh, the dog...a black-and-white demon. As soon as I got close, it noticed me and growled at me. The kids shouted at me to go away, so I left...but as I went, I heard them chanting. I looked back, they were performing some kind of...ritual. Trying to raise some kind of pumpkin god. It was creepy. I left, and stayed in an inn overnight...when I woke up in the morning, the town was in chaos. Something, I don't know what, had come out of the pumpkin fields and ransacked a barn. Every horse inside had been devoured, it was...it was awful to see. The tracks weren't like anything I'd ever seen, it looked almost like a ball, or maybe even a pumpkin, dragging itself along with vines. They led right back to the pumpkin field, and when everyone got there, they found...oh, it was awful, they found one of the local children. Sacrificed, by the looks of it. Heart torn out and everything. It was so sad, they said he was such a sweet boy. Musical prodigy, too. Only ever wanted to play music...the townsfolk wanted me to go find the monster, to hunt it down, but I knew that the trail would lead back to those kids. I didn't know if I could hunt children, so I ran away. I left that town, and never returned. I'm not proud of it, and I don't know what happened after I did...but I've never been able to eat a pumpkin since then.\"She shuddered, remembering the gory scene in the barn and in the pumpkin field.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Roxanne watched the mysterious trio, who all very clearly thought their story was quite funny indeed.
