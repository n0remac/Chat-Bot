After the recent passing of his father Kazim\u00edr assumed leadership of House Jankowski and was eager to improve his family's standing in the Tripartite Kingdom of Lidwo.Kazim\u00edr's family hold lands to the southeast, bordering a range of nomadic horse folk.  For a time the nomads laid waste to their farms and villages, but ultimately the tables turned and House Jankowski secured that part of Lidwo's frontier.  This kind of past had taught the Jankowski family the importance of security and reliance on allies.  It encouraged loyalty to Lidwo's government and made them highly protective over their subjects and fellow countrymen.  Due to their lordship over other religious groups they also share the tolerance of the other noble families.Here, in Cracouia, the recent ascendant to House Jankwoski seeks a task.  His father's wasting illness made him unable to attend political events and other ceremonies, and certainly the other nobles found their house to be stagnating.

When bandits approached, he fought. Yet, when Sir Stigs was alone, he would return to his business with the earth below him.

As images of merry men and flowing alcohol besieged his mind, the details of the dirt path before him began to round, bulge, and rise slowly. Dust had become smoothed stone, and then soon after that a slightly elevated series of wooden planks. My, the joys of metamorphosis. And a stream below, between the cracks of what Sir Stigs presumed to be a bridge, for he hadn't bothered to look up just yet. He wouldn't want to lose his wits.

It had led him to this spot, where some sort of board and tacked-on papers stood defiantly mocking him, waving in the wind with their letters and pulpy materials.Hm... decisions, decisions. Sir Stigs tried to avoid decisions if he could. There were times where Sir Stigs had camped out at crossroads for days in order to choose a road to take. There was never a right choice, was there? In the end he always found a reason to take a road before another, perhaps to follow a whimsical leaf in the wind or away from a band of vengeful bandits on no particular path. it was too predictable to head back down the road he had just come from, wasn't it? Or was that the intention of the earth?If only he could read.He looked to the regal individual, sitting so gallantly upon his steed and with so many proteges.
