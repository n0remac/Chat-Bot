He paid no mind to dancing shadows around the campfire. Passing birds and other winged creatures were elements of foreground on a painting, not reasons to duck. There were those that were brave and hardy, who had trained to suppress this instinct of reaction. And then there was not having the instinct at all. He seemed to be infinitely capable of staring into space for an indeterminate amount of time. Though, if spoken to, he would always reply. To do otherwise would just be ill-mannered. When nobody was speaking with him, Sir Stigs would sometimes hum. It was something archaic, deep and wordless. The sound was more like a chant than a song; several monotonous strings of notes tied together to create a bottomless melody. Chords echoed within his armor. So quiet was his humming, though, that the notes could hide behind a gentle wind or the rustling of leaves. It could be hidden, but not mistaken by anything in nature. It was of and only could be Sir Stigs.Sir Stigs also spoke through his footsteps. His helmet remained south of level as the group traversed over wild terrain, always fixated on the ground. Or, perhaps the feet in front of him. Was he focused on anything in particular? He didn't show it. And if asked, he didn't know it. His left arm remained at a strong right angle, fingers perpetually gripped about the reins of Kazimir's horse. In fact, it was difficult to remember Sir Stigs not holding that damned horse. Surely he had let go at some point. Surely.Only one thing was for sure. He never rode the thing, always shaking his head and muttering something of a pony.Once they had reached their destination, Sir Stigs raised his clasped fist at an angle towards one of the hussars.\"Would you take this? My arm is tired.\"Given the hussar complied, he would saunter his way forward, shoulder somewhat slouching. Sir Stigs curled his fingers and leaned his neck forward onto them. He listened to Kazimir through the top of his helmet, then craned his neck upward.Split Up. Disappearances. Dusk.\"I'll go here,\" Sir Stigs said. He pointed toward the literal nearest house, and then the next, and the next, as if to suggest he would go door-to-door.

Sir Stigs merely shuffled one foot in place, toe digging into soil. He listened to the wind dying as it took one last strike at rustling leaves. He heard the faint warbles of birds\u00a0charm the forest so dreaded. Most importantly, he felt each individual grain of dirt run over the plate of his boot. It was nobody else's turn but his own. This is where the path led. The well was the landmark, after all.<br/><br/>\"I will go,\" Sir Stigs stated plainly.<br/><br/>With this, he would make his way to one of the horses, who had rope wrapped about upon the side of its saddle. Sir Stigs would fasten the rope around his waist, which was a hefty sum given his girth rivaled his height. With much coil still remaining, he would toss the rope onto the ground. It glided wildly through the air and in no general direction before flailing uneventfully onto the ground. Thud. Sir Stigs did not wait for any one individual to grab the rope before leaving.

He stared, his perception just clearing the height of the well. Someone was laughing. Sir Stigs had never enjoyed falling long distances. Perhaps diving into water would make things better. He also wondered how one could enjoy themselves to the point of sounding like a woman. And weren't there two men that fell into the well? Why wasn't the other laughing? Sir Stigs decided to investigate with a terse swing of his neck downward, gazing into the well.Hm. Interesting.A low, monotonous humming, one sound that could only be Sir Stigs, began to play. It was akin to a hammer striking a coiled, stretched length of metal wire. There was something of the 'witchcraft' as Kazimir called it that irked Sir Stigs. That, or the fact that he was not particularly fond of laughing for no apparent reason. Sir Stigs could not tell.In the midst of his thoughts, the pensive Sir noticed a snake had erupted from the well. That confused him. He'd just been looking into that very same well. As it took to toward the air toward Kazimir, he was caught in whimsy. Sir Stigs could only deduce, as he had never known a snake to enter the water, that it was capable of teleportation. He would need to be extra careful against this creature. Before he could engage, he felt the hand of Kazimir wrap about his wrist. He broke his grasp and stood still for a moment. Had Kazimir attempted to grapple him? Sir Stigs stared at him blankly, one arm defensively back and the other engaged. No, there was no time to spar at the moment.There was no need to disengage. They were many vs. one... and a half? Sir Stigs wasn't sure how many fighters a large snake accounted for.\"Watch the well,\" Sir Stigs said.With the utmost care, he would swing with a wild haymaker toward the snake. He sought to wrap his hands about the neck of it, just before the head.

Once it was dead, the snake would shrink rapidly like a sun-dryed tomato and get darker until it was the size of a pea-pod. At that point, it quickly burned away like a roll of paper, leaving no ashes behind.\u00a0As the quick encounter ended, there would be temporary silence only broken every so often by a soft wind. It would once more be like the windy laugh Stigs experienced earlier except that Kazimir Jankowski  would feel it too this time. As it howled past some of the trees, there was rustling of leaves, birds chirping and rodents squeaking, even an owl hooted. A lot of these natural sounds combined to make a noise that sounded as though the wind no longer just had the texture of a laugh, but the echoes of one too.\u00a0As Stigs would go on to survey the well, he'd see naught in it but the depths of an ordinary well with a newt or two inside relieving themselves in fear. If he concentrated just hard enough, he'd see a skull and crossbones in the depths. The jaw of the skull was wide open and it seemed in his last moments the fallen person had heard a good joke. Yet again, the same windy laugh would arise but much louder, thicker, closer and livelier, hypnotizing almost. The laugh somehow promised you weren't worth anything, but if you bent the knee to a superior being, if you just accepted undying fealty to your TRUE betters than all would be better for your worthless hide.
