The floor, made of stone, was patterned to reveal an interlocked symbol of balance and led up to a set of thirteen steps that themselves led to a large, golden bell surrounded on either side by two silver plates each hanging from a frame.Fuxi climbed the first few of these steps after crossing the hall, then turned to face the newcomers.

You may have killed a thousand men in combat, remaining utterly undefeated; you may have many concubines, offspring and great estates that stretch from one horizon to the next. On the outside, you may be a king, an Emperor or a great hero or villain who has saved or conquered nations... But here, you are none of those things.\"On these grounds, beginning under my tutelage, you are a small child once again learning to walk. You are an ignorant pupil, whose mind must be opened to the basic tenants of knowledge. Your gods and religions have no sway here, for whether they be set in the stone of reality or written on the pages of mythology, they here serve a force greater than all of them: that of balance.\"If you wish to learn under me, for me to share with you the secrets I have discovered and mastered in my thousand years of walking this world, you must forget everything you know. You will empty your mind of all truths, lies and preconceptions. You must forget how to fight, how to run, how to jump, how to breathe, for you will discover here that you have been doing many of these things wrong for your entire lives!\"Master Fuxi slowly descended the steps once more and with an elegant gesture of his hand, pointed to the weapon racks lining the sides of the halls. \"To start with, you must relinquish your weapons. You can retrieve them at any time, but know that if you do so before you are ready, you will face punishment and perhaps even banishment from this place. Why is this? Because I would not trust a child with a sword. In this place, you will not learn to use a weapon until you have mastered how to fight with your body.

Thus, the pandas are strong.\"Eventually, after a good twenty minutes more, this forest opened out to reveal the final stretch of journey: a hill with a slope so deep one would have to use their hands to climb it. At the bottom of this fifty-foot near-drop, a large, open pool was fed by the shallow stream they passed before and a single waterfall that made up the opposite bank. The water of this pool was so incredibly clear that they could see the bottom with near-perfect clarity.

He had one bucket on his head whilst another in his right hand; while he was encumbered on the head he would not have to do it twice, and yet he still had a hand free to help him climb unlike the other two students which as far as he was concerned was an advantage. He just had to make sure his neck was still in the right shape when he reach the hill's summit. It was a lot of bloody strain on it.\u00a0"}, "post-62901": {"user": "Kenji", "user_num": 1627, "timestamp": "1492128459000", "message": "Kenji had to pause and chuckle for a moment at Violet.

It was not a bad memory in of itself, but rather it was the individual featured that caused him pain. Yes indeed, his brain reminded him.
