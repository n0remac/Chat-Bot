The god of thunder had been angered, or perhaps waged war above the clouds. In any case, it set an ominous tone for her journey forward, a trip she had only set out upon a week prior. The quick sweeping storm had left the typically vigilant huntress unprepared for an evening camp that would keep dry and warm. Her hides and tunic had completely soaked through, runnels of rain cascading off the boar tusks that adorned her head. The cold bite of night meant it was likely she would freeze to death out in the cold. Making a fire was out of the question, the leaf litter and ready wood was drenched from the storm, it would be no easy feat to spark a flame in that dampness. The discerning adventurer began to weigh her options, her teeth grit as she fought to maintain her composure, continuing to traipse through the forest, unflinching as droplets of cold wet rain bore down on her broad buffalo shoulders, each one cutting through the fur and cloth she wore like an icy dagger. She weighed her options: she could take refuge in the warmth of a gutted carcass, however, she'd spent much of her strength hunting the stag now slung over her right shoulder in preparation for an evening meal, the wily creature darting back and forth through the dense trees, dodging her javelins with uncanny grace. Her hands shook from the cold, it would be hard to throw accurate shots if this was her plan to survive the night. The only other chance she had to survive this was to find more permanent shelter, a cave, or a hollowed tree trunk... It felt as though the gods were testing her here, as though they too desired to see her test her mettle as she toiled with the tasks of The Bloody Path. She would not yield, she had to see this through, she refused to stumble at her first hurdle. The woman looked down at the pale black markings which adorned her left hand, her eyes gently darting across the runes as she read the tattoo that snaked across her forearm. For the first time in a long time, she yearned for Freyja's guidance, a call for divine intervention. It seemed her patron goddess would answer the cries of her devout disciple as Roskva pushed on through the thinning trees, breaking through the treeline into a gentle clearing. The rain came down harder without tree coverage, but Roskva might have found her salvation in the gentle amber glow at the center of the field. She let slip a breath she had not realized she held so tight, tension melting from her jaw and shoulders as a quaint little wooden cabin came into view, the glow of a fire inside seemed to suggest someone was home as well. The lumbering huntress broke into a light jog that came to a still stop at what appeared to be the front door of the cabin. She raised a leathery knuckle up to the door and hesitated a moment as a flash of worry flooded her mind. She didn't exactly look like the most reputable evening house guest. Slick and soaked with rain, her lumbering frame swelled to fill the entirety of the doorframe, her boar's head headress and draping soggy furs, an axe at her belt and a bundle of javelins slung over one shoulder, the other supporting the bloody corpse of a freshly killed deer. She looked like a marauder at best, a feral beast at worst. She grit her teeth once more, a grunt and a snort escaping as she sharply exhaled. She wasn't exactly rich with other options, she just hoped she could explain herself in time before the homeowner caved her skull in with a weapon of their own.She rapped on the door, three firm but gentle knocks, her heart racing as she listened carefully for movement from within. People, she was terrible with people, and dealing with these uncertain circumstances cause her more anxiety than any bloody battle to the death. \"Ah..uh..excuse me. I realize it is late, and you're not likely expecting visitors...but I was hoping you might let me wait out the storm here. It is quite cold and..and I wasn't able to set up camp in time for the storm. I have little coin but I have...uh...dinner. I'd be happy to share with you. Please, I promise I'll be gone the minute the rain stops, I just..I'm on a trip and well...I don't exactly have many other options. I'm sorry, but could you please open the door?\"\u00a0Roskva called, her voice booming with each word as she spoke just below a yell, hoping her voice would carry through the wooden walls of the cottage so whoever was inside could hear her. She had sputtered out her introduction, she just hoped it came across more as desperation rather than deception. The warrior tensed, watching the door closely as she waited for it to open, hopeful for a friendly face, but expectant of a sword blade or spear tip.

Through the pouring rain, she can see an idle light just off the road, and as she gets closer she sees the distinct silhouette of a quaint little cottage. Salvation! At least, she hopes. Walking very carefully along the road, hopping from stone to stone, and trying to stick to the shallow and drier parts of mud to avoid getting stuck, Fiona makes haste towards the cottage and hopefully somewhere she could dry off. The first thing on her mind is to double check her pack and make sure her belongings aren't soaked through, as last time she had been caught in a storm she had almost lost one of her nicer dresses. Thankfully she was able to salvage and fix it up good as new, but perhaps today she would not be so lucky. Then thoughts of payment flashes through her head. Who would let anyone in for free? Thankfully, she's prepared for such dealings, having just been paid, and if money wasn't enough, she has more to offer. Anything for a night out of the rain! Finally, she gets to the door, noticing the fresh boot prints along the pathway up. Good! Someone's home! Recently too, so perhaps they would be sympathetic to her plight. Wonderful! She reaches out and knocks with a delicate hand. Knock, knock-knock knock, knock! \"Hello? Is there anybody home? I would like to seek refuge from this dreadful downpour!\" She calls out. \"I will pay, of course! Oh, please help!\" Her acting is actually rather good, pretending to be one of a helpless nature. She takes a quick moment to clean herself up, fixing her lovely brown hair now that she has a tiny bit of cover from above the doorway, and checking her make-up in a tiny mirror. Thankfully, she managed to avoid messing it up too much in the rain, all thanks to her hood. The woman is a stark contrast from the previous house guest, standing shorter and skinnier, but far easier on the eyes. It's hard to see her form through her cloak, but her pale face and stunning green eyes peer through the gloom easily. \"C'mon\u2026 open up\u2026\" she mutters to herself as she begins to shiver.

This was certainly far from what she had expected to find within. Even setting aside the fact this poor woman had taken pity on her by hearing out her pleas, she had expected the door to open to someone more like herself. Life out in an isolated woodland cottage was far from easy, both on the body, and the mind. Most of the people she came across out in the woods were fellow huntsmen, foragers, or criminals hiding out in their isolation. This woman didn't appear to be any of the three, though as Roskva studied her appearance some more, this woman gave her a distinct impression, comparable to the druids who had taught her the art of animialistic channeling. Perhaps she was some sort of genius hermit, conducting her practice out here in the isolation and calm of the forest's heart. Whatever the case, Roskva certainly wasn't going to discredit her generosity on appearances alone, ready to cuddle up with some creep if it meant surviving the night. She was in many ways thankful this pretty, polite woman had answered the door.The lumbering viking did her best to shake off some of the wet and wipe her feet on the grass just outside the cabin before stepping in, not wanting to make a complete mess of this woman's entryway. The water continued to stream down the creases of her clothing in little fjords, a drippy puddle slowly forming at her feet as she stood. She gave a nod to the woman's instructions and watched as she disappeared into the recesses of the quaint little home. \"Thank you for this, truly. I realize this is less than convenient for you. Could I...have your name, if it wouldn't be too much trouble?\" the huntress asked softly, her voice far more meek than her towering frame would suggest, now that she had no reason to bellow out her words. Her voice was gravelly, a deep pitch for a woman, but gentle, the start of every thought hesitant. While her benefactor was off fetching blankets Roskva was quick to start removing her soaking wet attire, her boots and socks came off first, the boar's leather thoroughly soaked through. She left her boots by the door and tucked her socks into her belt to move them over to the fire, wiggling her toes, the skin wrinkled and pruned from the waterlogged boots. Roskva also left her javelin bundle at the entrance, leaning the leather pouch of wooden skewers up against the wall just next to the doorframe. She would graciously take the finely made quilt from the woman as she returned, and venture towards the fire at the homeowner's prompting. \"My thanks, again. I'm in your debt. I uh...do not have a habit of being unprepared. In all honesty, I am...slightly embarrassed to be asking for your aid.\" she explained, lumbering her way over to the fire place. She took a hesitant glance at her host before beginning to disrobe, unfamiliar with dressing down in front of others.Before anything came off she set the carcass of her latest kill by the fire, a dry-bled deer, the thing was a clean kill, it'd need to be skinned and quartered, but it left very little mess as she placed on the wooden floorboards. Preparing some food was some pittance of payback for her host, but she'd need to get warm first. With that, Roskva removed her clothing, paying close and careful attention to the boar's hide shawl and headdress that covered her head and stocky shoulders. As she removed the garment, she revealed her face in full. Short, scraggled black hair unfurled from the boar's head cap as she gently shook out her damp locks, hair falling just below her squared chin, her cold, dark eyes reflecting the flickering flames nearby. She stripped to her underclothes, which were damp but would dry quickly, revealing a body of thick taught muscle, rough, leathery skin, and marked with countless nasty, gnarled scars, some raised and red, others more like deep creases in the skin. She quickly cloaked herself with the blanket she'd been provided and lowered herself to sit as close as she could to the fire's edge, one knee up, the other leg tucked under her as she tightly wrapped herself with the quilt. The frozen forest stalker had just begun to settle in and get comfortable when an unexpected, almost comical thing occurred. Another set of knocks started tapping away at the cabin door. She met eyes with her still unfamiliar host and shrugged her shoulders, indicating she had no idea or affiliation with whoever else had just wandered towards the cottage. \"Maybe you should consider a bed and breakfast, seems like you'd have pretty steady patrons.\" The woman quipped with a sly grin, quickly picking herself up from the floor. She reached for her axe, which lay still clinging to her belt loop by the fire's edge. She gave a nod to the petite woman who'd let her in and gestured to the door, prompting her to answer it, Rosvka readying herself if this next wandering traveler had less than savory intentions.

She takes a moment to take off her rain cloak, revealing a slim, fit, and somewhat beautiful form underneath, as her traveling clothes seem to have been tailored to fit, so she must have some kind of coin. Then again, her clothing isn't flashy, so she can't be one of the elite bourgeoisie, surely, in fact her clothing's dull colours of greens, brown, and white, don't denote much status at all. However, the silver dove broach she wears on her belt may explain some things, at least to those that recognise it. She hangs her cloak up on a peg by the door, feeling so much lighter and drier without it. It's an effective piece of clothing, one she's glad she made the investment in, as she finds herself only mildly damp around her shoulders, not enough to disrobe, for the moment at least. She takes a brief moment to take off her boots and an even longer moment to remove her long stockings, but she soon turns to the other ladies, revealing her beautiful green eyes, her well cared for brown hair, and a winning smile.

Please, if there is anything else I can do to return the favour, be it coin or any other form of compensation, I will gladly pay.\" Her focus had been on Tanis for the majority of the time, and who could blame her?

I'm Fiona, by the way.\" She drapes the blanket over her legs and points her feet to the fire, already feeling cozy. Even if it cost her more than a pretty penny, she already felt like it'd be worth it.

She would return to her seat at the fire as the other girl also made her way to sit by its edge, plopping back down in the same position she'd assumed earlier. Tanis was not long to join them, and she came bearing food. Vegetables and bread, it seemed a meal would be in order. Her hands had warmed enough to make steady work with a knife.

She graciously accepts the tea and takes a good long sip, followed by a satisfying sigh. \u201cThat\u2019s good, warms up the insides just right.\u201d \u201cOh no, I\u2019m certainly no forester,\u201d Fiona says, shifting her attention back to the burly lass, as she begins digging into the pack she had set down beside her seat. \u201cI tend to stick to the cities, business is much much easier to come by there. I\u2019m just moving between towns visiting some more rural clients, but I\u2019m headed back to Isra. It does seem like I\u2019ve taken a wrong turn somewhere though.\u201d She soon pulls out a small sack of coins, and begins counting them. \u201cProbably at the crossroads up the road. Must have taken a right when I meant to take a left. Or perhaps my map is wrong? I\u2019ll find out soon enough.\u201d She stands once again, pulling the blanket off her lap, and walks towards Tannis, coin bag in hand. Her footsteps are curiously silent, and she walks with a practiced grace, this lady is surely a class act, yet she dresses so humbly. \u201cYour home is beautiful,\u201d she says as she approaches. Even though she prefers the hustle and bustle of the city, the small, quaint little cottage is still lovely, even if she would go stir crazy. She briefly wonders how Tanis doesn\u2019t go nuts, but the amount of hobbies and curious items around make it obvious how she keeps herself occupied. \u201cWill one hundred coins settle the inconvenience of letting me shelter from the storm?\u201d she asks, holding out the coin bag. \u201cPlease, it's the least I can do for such hospitality.\u201d ", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Fiona blinks and looks away as Roskva begins butchering the deer.

She certainly wasn't the most elegant woman in the room, cutting up meat for a meal and greedily sucking down what was offered to her. \"Thank you for that, it really warms the heart. You have a good taste for tea.\" Roskva remarked, giving Tanis a gentle smile, which quickly faded as the warrior returned to the woman's mention of payment. \"I have little in the way of coin...my family was...not wealthy, especially not in the end. I have only a few silvers to spare, I'm truly sorry for this. All I can really provide in my craft.\" she remarked, her shoulders softly sagging as she admitted to Tanis her incapacity to compensate her well.Roskva returned to her task at hand. The dejected glare from Fiona did little to deter her from continuing. This wasn't a particularly uncommon practice back home, if anything, bringing someone a clean kill to make a meal of in her village was often seen as a generous gift. She moved her work with dinner over to the meal prep table, taking great care not to make a mess of Tanis' place as she did so. Roskva moved to her travel kit, producing a small cast iron pot. She would then wander towards the door, bringing with her the ungutted remains of the deer, which were quickly tossed out into the rain. The smell would be all but drowned out by the downpour, and the rain made quick work of filling her little pot, the pitter pattering of rain on the rough metal almost musical as she held it out in the storm from the doorway.She turned to look at Fiona as she waited for it to fill, affirming her assertions about Tanis, though conveniently skipping over any more discussion of her arrival not being an intrusion on anything salacious. \"Certainly. It seems we were both quite fortunate to come across a woman like her out here, there aren't exactly a lot of hospitable forest hermits out there. I believe it was the Gods who led me to this cabin.\" she remarked, looking to Tanis another moment, an appreciative smile on her face. As her pot filled with rainwater, the looming hunter closed the door and returned to the cottage's inner recesses, setting what would now be the base for her simple soup on the table. her eyes drifted to Tanis as she turned to grab for a few raw vegetables from the basket she had provided them. \"These are quite succulent, did you grow them yourself?\" she asked, wondering if the homeowner would open up a bit more herself. Roskva made quick work of dicing and slicing the vegetables into little pieces, dropping them in her pot, along with a few choice cuts of the meat she had cleaved from the deer. She would've preferred to grill them, but a soup would keep longer, and she could more readily share it with the others. While no court chef, the steely warrior seemed to have prepared something semi competent, returning to the fire's edge to set about bringing the water to a boil and cooking her little impromptu meal. As she returned fireside her attention turned to Fiona once more. \"I take it you're a merchant then? Selling what, if I might ask? If you're heading for Isra, then perhaps we could set out in the morning together, if it suited you. I assure you you won't be lost at my side, but in truth, I could use some guidance and information when it came to the city itself. It might benefit us both, to travel together. Consider it, eh?\" she remarked, tilting her head as she proposed the idea to the stranger. She needed to get to a foreign realm, Isra seemed like the easiest trek, but the warrior for all her strength had little idea what to expect or how to carry herself once she arrived, travelling with a native, or atleast a regular visitor, would be a massive aid in her quest. She hoped silently that Fiona would see as much value in the idea as she did. Roskva gave an acknowledging grunt to the girl's comment on the house. It was certainly extravagant, atleast as far as the simple village girl was concerned, and full of all sorts of interesting little trinkets. \"It's quite nice. Bought or built I wonder? It reminds me of a druid's secluded grove back home.\" she remarked, looking to Tanis to see if she had any comment on her home, or what it was she did out here. Roskva averted her eyes back to cooking as Fiona brought up coin again, mentioning offering a hundred coins which, save for them being coppers, would be a significant payday for a single night's stay. If she had money to throw around like that, she was certainly quite successful with her craft, whatever it was.

Roskva's eyes widened as the woman made mention of turning her less savory house guests into frogs, or that was the implication anyway. It seemed her druid comparisons were far more accurate than she originally thought. Roskva gave a vigorous nod as Fiona asserted her peaceful intentions. \"No ill will from me, far from it. I have a great respect for talented mages, and you've been a gracious host.\" she said, waving a dismissive hand as she tried to assuage any potential concerns Tanis had about her, not particularly fond of the idea of being a slimy little amphibian. Roskva eyed Fiona as she dismissed the woman's idea of opening a rest stop here, shrugging her shoulders softly, the blanket which hung from them gently jostling with the motion. \"I'm not so sure. Something definitely seems to draw travelers here, be it the Gods, the location, or the flow of the forest. I have not seen any other resting spots nearby, you might make good business here.\" Roskva countered, trying to provide a more optimistic spin to Tanis. She didn't like to crush spirits unless they were stirring stupid ideas, but the huntress didn't think a place for the more delicate traveler to rest was necessarily ill conceived. Attention the refocused on Fiona, and as the words started coming the steely warrior became more and more flustered, a burning crimson stained her cheeks and ears as the young woman explained her...business. Roskva was wholly unfamiliar when it came to that aspect of interaction, and was ruffled by it far more than she cared to admit, though that fact was blatant on her face. \"O-Oh I uh...yes, one of those girls then. I um...I see. Plea- Please don't think I offered for you to come along because I'm interested in anything like that..it was- not...I didn't realize...\" she sputtered, fighting to get out every word, her mind racing faster and faster, face burning hotter with each stumbled syllable as she dug herself into a deep, embarrassing hole. Her eyes were plastered the floorboards as she could no longer look either of the other women in the eye. Roskva gave a firm nod and a bestial grunt to Fiona's agreement for them to travel together, though now the prudish hunter was wholly reconsidering if that offer had been a grave mistake.

To house what? I think a loft for rent would serve you well if you planned to add that sort of expansion to your home as it was already. I think you would find a reliable market. Good animals pay for themselves over time...unless they're the type you slaughter.

Damn.\u00a0shhhhhhlkh.\" It was a long cycle that followed the Knight as he walked through the forest. He was clearly wounded, a trail of blood being left behind him that gave the skin under his armour a very pale complexion. Any predator could have followed it, if not for the evidence that this was not a very wise move around the man's right leg: a werewolf had perfectly sunk its claws into his flesh, right in the gaps of his plate where they could go in between rings of chainmail and penetrate gambeson to finally leave large holes. Felhurt dragged the thing with it's caved in head along, fearing causing more damage now by removing it than keeping the claws in for now. Of course, that wasn't the only injury sustained. It managed to root a claw around into the depths of his visor leaving his face with many small cuts, though the worst were the two gashes across Felhurt's neck and stomach; he was lucky not to be holding bits of intestine from falling out of him.\u00a0He cried out in pain, the sound transitioning into a whimper. The Knight was alone, a stranger in a strange land. Felhurt had nothing more to his name. The Order collapsed, he was effectively a Free Knight even if many of his former Brothers disagreed, amassing in number in Toragana and other hot spots. He hadn't made it to any of the caravans and fleets, and as such was stranded. The warrior had no money, no squire, no friends or even acquaintances to call upon. Fighting evil alone for no reward was very honourable, yes, you most likely got great reward for it in the next life. But without any reward now, it was very hard to go on.However, it seemed lady luck smiled upon him! There was a small clearing, and a cottage by a stream. It looked old, run down, and likely not the most comfortable place to be. But it was respite, it was somewhere he could lick his wounds argh lick them for a very long time, and then go on. The Knight stopped before the building, shoulders heaving with each breath. After a pained scream he removed the beast's claws from his flesh, falling on to the door. His vision faded very slowly and his eyes were about to close until with a start he forced them open. He had come too far to die now, just a little more! His hands were shaking, and his helmet seemed to both suffocate and blind him at the same time; unable to open the door properly given he couldn't even find the handle he would simply try to force it open with a strike of his shoulder. It opened violently as the metal of his shoulder pad struck wood, and he fell in. He dragged himself inside about a metre before giving up, knowing he was out of strength in a pool of his own blood. Felhurt tried to lie down in a way that his wounds would face the sky. The man gave a high chuckle that many would label a death-throe, realizing he had too many places he was bleeding to lie down in a way that prevented too much loss of blood. In fact, as consciousness left him he felt happy at the fact \u2014 it was liberating to know that he now had no worries.\u00a0Everything turned black.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"Damn.
