But even if you did put trust into us, that doesn't mean we should reciprocate.\" A much better argument in Laszlo's eyes was that the self interested bastard of a relative that he had was willing to go and do this, so at least it wouldn't be fatal right? Shrugging, he went along but making sure he kept an eye both on this woman of wonders and Vasco. He got more and more annoyed by the moment even though his sober state persisted.

It seemed odd for someone to willingly debilitate themselves like that, perhaps it had something to do with her powers.
