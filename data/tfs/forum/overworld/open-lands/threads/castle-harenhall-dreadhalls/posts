{"post-12125": {"user": "Ulfang von Haren", "user_num": 416, "timestamp": "1443546408000", "message": "HarenhallCastle Harenhall was, until recently, just a pile of rubble marring the hillside upon which it once sat. However, as of late, it has begun to rise again. Scaffolding has slowly risen up around the area, and shadows can be seen moving through the windows, shuffling about as if mindless or half-dead, according to those who have gotten close enough to see. Any who have tried to enter the castle have not returned, and so the identity of whoever is building the castle back up is unknown. It is certainly a great mystery.Harenhall was once lovingly nicknamed \"The Dreadhalls\" in its time of glory, named as such for the Von Haren family and their army of Dread Knights that once walked its halls. The Von Haren family was a family seemingly cursed to wield dark, dangerous powers, necromancers all, their power apparently inherited through blood. With this power, they controlled a massive tract of cold, yet fertile\u00a0land, with thousands upon thousands of subjects. Although one might at first think that this era was one of tyranny and disparity, historical texts speak of the reign of the Von\u00a0Harens as a time of peace and prosperity, with even the poorest commoner able to fill their belly every night, and every town flourishing with trade and agriculture. All the Von Harens asked for in exchange was unbending, unwavering loyalty. The penalty of denying this was to be sacrificed, the souls of the guilty used to enhance the strength of the Von Haren family. Unfortunately, the Von Harens apparently went extinct during the cataclysm, and their home turned to rubble.InteriorHarenhall is a massive citadel.\u00a0Even the gatehouse is massive in size, and one feels as if they're being watched as they enter, despite the castle being apparently uninhabited. The plaza leading up to the castle's main hall is overgrown\u00a0with thistle and nightshade, and the fountains which once\u00a0glistened splendidly\u00a0with water shooting toward the heavens have run dry, vines clogging their\u00a0openings and wrapping about their lengths. The main hall itself is massive, once the meeting place of nobles and kings, now empty and desolate.\u00a0Nowhere is the\u00a0grandiosity of\u00a0the citadel\u00a0more evident than the looming throne room, on its own the size of a great cathedral. The throne room and the looming throne itself has been carved entirely out of one massive black onyx stone, every pillar and railing and glimmering step flush with one another, seamlessly connected. The throne is carved in such a way to\u00a0loom over the observer, upon a\u00a0dais with\u00a0several steps leading up. The back is\u00a0fashioned into\u00a0the ribs of a skeletal being, and each\u00a0armrest is shaped as a spine leading up to a skull leering\u00a0out at the observer.\u00a0In the center of the throne room, a great fountain spews green light from its center, the light swirling about before collecting in a pool of ectoplasm beneath. Any cleric or paladin worth their marbles will feel extremely uneasy\u00a0in this room, and sense a great many souls\u00a0collected in the pool. The castle is possessed of a great many hearth rooms, and the main banquet hall is almost as big as the throne room itself, a fountain at the head of the table depicting a gargoyle spitting black, corrupted water into a bowl that it holds, although the bowl never overfills. To each side of the massive red oak table in the center, black onyx\u00a0pillars loom over the observer, curved inward as if the huge stone gargoyles at the top supporting the roof on their shoulders are peering venomously\u00a0down at the tiny humanoids. The entire castle is a bit of a labyrinth to anyone unused to navigating it, its dark interior broken only by the occasional plaza or open stable. If one finds their way below, they will come across a huge dungeon, impenetrably dark, stretching for what seems like kilometres in every direction. Screams still seem to echo from the depths of the dungeon, cells and oubliettes that one may never discover still filled with the anguish of the dead. If one is lucky, they'll be able to find the Von Haren family archives splitting from the dungeon, a huge room carved into the stone, massive steel\u00a0bookshelves stretching for leagues above. These\u00a0present\u00a0their\u00a0own sort of maze through what seems like millions of ancient books, many of which have been lost to time, though wonderfully preserved in this near-sterile environment. A study is connected to the archives, separated by a heavy black iron door. Within, three lavish, yet ancient cushioned chairs sitting about a long-dead hearth, though iron torches shaped like hands hold perpetually burning disembodied green flames burning within, whispers of the damned echoing from the flames. It would appear to the trained observer that the torches are powered by souls. Twelve people lost their lives just to provide light to a noble's study. A waste of life to some.All in all, Castle Harenhall is both a nightmare and the explorer's dreamscape, although it may not be entirely uninhabited...", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://www.wall321.com/thumbnails/detail/20121202/mountains%20clouds%20landscapes%20castles%20ruins%20fantasy%20art%20digital%20art%20artwork%20portuguese%201489x811%20wal_www.wall321.com_17.jpg", "http://img02.deviantart.net/3aac/i/2012/353/4/d/castle_ruins_by_iidanmrak-d5o6ylv.jpg"], "html": "<p><strong><u>Harenhall</u></strong></p>"}, "post-12149": {"user": "Aesa Jojora, the One-Handed", "user_num": 640, "timestamp": "1443562933000", "message": "Aesa and her band of warriors, along with those Varan mercenaries who had retreated from the Battle of the Phoenix and the Lion, made their way back into Asgeir.

The sunlight filters through the trees, warm against one's skin, giving a pleasant contrast to the chilly Northern air, which makes one's breath steam. It is obvious now why Ulfang wears that fur cloak of his so religiously.Ulfang looks back to Azure \u00a0with a smile.\"We're only a day's ride away now, my dear,\" he tells her. It had been a long and arduous journey of a full three months. When an Inn could not be found, they were forced to share a small tent, putting one another in close quarters, though Ulfang had to admit he found it rather pleasant.He had felt Azure slipping, and so while they were on the road, he had been secretly grasping the jewel and siphoning pieces of his soul into it, in order to keep her from disappearing forever. What a shame it would be to lose her so soon after meeting her. Luckily, they had run into some highwaymen who foolishly attempted to steal their mule-drawn cart, and Ulfang had taken their essence for the inconvenience, so the draw didn't make him so tired as it might have. However, he does appear noticeably more gaunt now than when the trip began, as if he's not eaten in a few days. He hopes Azure didn't notice, as she'd been rather taken aback by the proposal the first time. Regardless, he would rather sacrifice part of himself than lose her forever.

The eyes of many unblinking black-skinned ghouls stare down at the trio as they enter, identifying the brothers as their masters and the woman as a guest.

It looks up at Ulfgar with glowing red eyes full of compassion, and the older Von Haren kneels down to scratch his head.\"Thorvald! Did you miss me? I bet you did,\" says Ulfgar as he scritches his hellhound, the dog's ears twitching happily as it whines and flips over onto its belly.Ulfang looks on with a grin.\"He's still moving after all these years?

Upon the wall, various trophies of battle are hung up. A charred head of an enemy commander, a pair of blades he took from another. Upon a stand sits a set of plate armour lined with gold, well-made except that it seems a blade has sheared right through the chestplate, caked blood still marking the edges of the slash. On the opposite wall there lies a large oak armour decorated with raven carvings, a plain pine cabinet, and an eight foot tall mirror, wide and tall enough to display Ulfang's entire form. The room is lit by a small chandelier that hangs from the cieling, supporting six red candles, as well as several silver lamps sat on various pieces of furniture about the room.The one truly luxurious piece of furniture in the room is the bed, massive and stuffed with down, several large blankets made by Ulfang himself after hunting trips covering the sheets. The pillows are large and velvety, extremely comfortable. It seems a bit out of place in the otherwise fairly spartan room.This is where Ulfang deposits Azure, setting her down as gently as he can. He smiles softly down at her.\"I imagine you'd like to rest, my dear.

Ulfang, however, has another target as he rides through the raised portcullis, his eyes immediately falling upon those vibrant blue irises of her lover's.He grins a wide grin as he sees her and trots up beside her, dismounting and chuckling heartily at her noble greeting. His is a very different one. Without saying a word, he cups her face with his huge, rough hand and leans down to plant a long, loving kiss upon her lips.When he finally pulls back, he replies, his voice filled with love and compassion, \"And I missed it, my love, and you. Every day I was gone I thought of naught but your beautiful face waiting for me when I returned.\"He then hugs her tight, although as he feels her bulge against his abdomen he pulls back just enough to give her a raised brow, his expression slightly curious. He knows what he felt, but her plain, obscuring outfit suddenly makes sense to him. She was trying to hide a pregnant belly. Azure likely knows him well enough to know his expression means, \"do we need to speak in private?\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Ulfang's vast army stretches as far as the eye can see along the Black Road, ranks upon ranks of undead preceeded by considerably fewer Dread Knights clad in gleaming black plate.

Birds chirp to one another outside his window, and the machinations of his peoplr hustling and bustling can be heard just outside in the hall and the various training grounds dotting the Dreadhalls. The \u00a0sun filters through the silky white curtains , gentle rays illuminating his love's face as Azure lies there before him, within his arms. He gives her a gentle snuggle, and then carefully withdraws his arms from her, kissing gently up the nape of her neck as he plays idly with her hair.
