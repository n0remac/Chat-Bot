The trees seem to stretch on for miles, over hill and valley alike. They're large and old, and as you go deeper into the forest, the tops of the trees cover the sky completely. Despite this, it never seems to get darker. Flowers still bloom, and animals still skirt around in the undergrowth around your feet. Deeper and deeper you go, until you come across a clearing.\u00a0 In this clearing, a woman. She is turned away, hunched over the picnic before her. Bread and meat cover the cloth she has laid out on the ground as she slices portions off of a slab of meat. There is far too much for one woman to eat.
