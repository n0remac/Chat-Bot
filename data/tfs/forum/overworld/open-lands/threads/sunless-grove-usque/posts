Yet the very air of the dark growth seems to be alive and heavy - tainted by something born in the shade. The land just seems to sink into the heart of the world, where the trees just continue to get bigger and maintain the tightly knitted canopy despite the shift in the land - and despite the occasional hollow through sheer but short cliffs and hills with stone overhangs, the flora just meshes and overwhelms any cold rock with moss and vines and leaves. Unlike the whispers of the golden sun-touched forests known of the Usque, the sounds of this lost wood swallowed in shadow are much more menacing and unnerving with hisses and clicks and strange warbles of unknown creatures.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.pinimg.com/564x/83/35/2d/83352d6dbcc9a6bd23929b4bb3491b74.jpg"], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.pinimg.com/564x/83/35/2d/83352d6dbcc9a6bd23929b4bb3491b74.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/><br/></div>"}}
