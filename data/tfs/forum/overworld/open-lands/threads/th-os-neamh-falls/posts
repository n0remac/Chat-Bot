An unpleasant beginning to his newest endeavor. For the many years the fey had wandered, he had only recently found himself in the company of human civilization, and to find himself in a human civilization under the earth itself? Well, the situation was simply too intriguing to pass up. He had never been beneath the earth, in the embrace of the warm, moist soil of nature. It was an appealing prospect, and as he sat cross-legged on the center of the lift he made certain to peek over the small half-wall that served as railing in an attempt to keep anyone from reaching their destination much quicker than the lift allowed. Those humans around him stood awkwardly, attempting the crowd away from the queer individual who seating himself so strangely in their midst. Unfortunately this particular curiosity was less for his own pleasure, and more out of necessity. His hooves provided inadequate surface area for the creaking, swaying lift and he had no hope of keeping his balance on the way down. As such, he was quite content to plant himself firmly to the ground. At last the elevator reached the floor, and as people began to shuffle out, they soon forgot any peculiarities they had suffered to make it here. How could they bother with one strange nonhuman when they could see the splendor of the gracefully cascading Neamh Falls? Even Rook soon forgot any discomfort. When he had at last managed to wriggle free of the tangle of exiting bodies his golden eyes gleamed with unrestrained pleasure at the sight of such natural beauty. A micro bay, complete with a small beach and tourists. A small, puffy tail wagged in excitement at the sight and he had to fight his natural desire to frolic and lose himself to the sights, the smells and little trinkets handed out at stalls. He was here for a reason, he knew that. Besides, if the entryway looked like this, surely he would be in awe of the beauty he was no see! Breaking off from the rest of the gawkers, he weaved through the crowds, taking in the sights and scents of nature mingled with human influence. Instead he headed towards the gates. Less inviting than his previous fascination, he found, and as he approached he slowed, his hooves making soft clattering noises as he closed the distance and raising a hand towards any that could see him. \"Eagle Lace!\" he called allowed, waving.

The hymn was sung quietly but artfully in a pleasant high baritone, just faintly heard in the distance as a man approached the entrance of Neamh Falls. The figure was not quite tall but certainly above average. He was wearing quite good clothes, a brown leather over-coat with a blue cloth and brown wool ensemble of buttoned shirt and pants, a thick silk neckerchief covering his throat. His boots were tall, heavy things of a jet-black clearly quite hefty with blackened steel caps, but paradoxically making little to no sound. Upon his head was a brown leather hate, while from a belt hung a sword of indeterminate variety thanks to the rather thick scabbard and the man's coat, though his leather gloved hands stayed near it at all times.\u00a0Suave would be the best term to describe the man, though still very inaccurate. Suavely menacing? No, not quite either.... As his words faded to naught he walked on quietly, apparently contemplating something. His lips moved as he spoke quietly, unheard to all but the supernatural. \"Like a dog without a bone, an actor out on loan.\" The man wasn't sweating but he nevertheless wiped his face, perhaps hoping the physical act of cleansing would translate into the post-physical.\u00a0He entered the cave, nodding amiably to those around him. His face was not particularly memorable, easily described as being from North to North-East to East. Description of eyes ranged from amber to green to blue to brown, while memory of his hair would range from a buzzed jet-black to a curly blonde.
