He did, briefly, consider changing his garb to better match the local flavor but ultimately did not. Partly because it would make him easier to find whenever, whoever, was supposed to find him came looking and partly because he could do nothing for the color of his skin without more effort than he was willing to expend for this task. Thus he walked as an outsider, as obvious as a sore thumb, into the heart of Thios. His kind are attracted to passion and nowhere did passion burn so brightly than in the slums of a city. Where people lived, died, laughed, loved, and struggled as a community. While the nobility and rich had such passions they were fewer in number and less prone to obvious expressions of it, something that was to their detriment in his opinion. Although perhaps he'd have been safer sticking to the well to do parts of the city, as an outsider he had to imagine that the question was not if he would be accosted but when.

He moved side to side, kicking off of a wall before jumping and kicking his spurs together twice in the air before he landed and continued.

She closed her eyes. It helped.The sound of a sword whipping sharply through the air. Something you didn\u2019t hear very often around here.She dropped to the ground which was quite a way, breaking her fall by sliding down a length of rope, burning her hands. Her boots slammed into the cobbles, sending stagnant water spraying. The street was relatively quiet. People had begun to disperse. Alva glanced around quickly. Over her shoulder she would make eye contact with a man who seemed very out of place. Her watch was questioning, and already somewhat confrontational. She said nothing and continued on her way. If Vidkun had been looking for trouble, Alva was the kind of person who invited it. And Rook, for that matter. Who she hoped would not fall from the sky.A little further along the street she spotted a shady figure standing at the entrance to one of the narrower passage ways. She recognised him \u2013 and unsurprisingly \u2013 that was where the suspicious noises had been echoing from. Before the boy could tell what was upon him, Alva grabbed him by the scruff of the neck. To keep him out of trouble if anything else. He struggled for a few moments before realising who his capturer was. And instead, let out a defeated groan.In the alley, Alva watched the two men face-off. One had their back to her. He was large, foreign, and obviously the reason Ant had called for her. Opposite him stood someone she knew unfortunately well. He was bleeding from a slice across his cheek and holding up his knives defensively whilst light on his feet, ready to prance away at the slightest notice. His concentration broke enough, however, to notice her standing, silhouetted between the walls.He snarled, lowering his arms slightly.

In a sense, he was right. This was not Alva\u2019s forte. Actually, she was fairly certain this specific job had only been given to her due to the fact that no one else was interested in skulking around after certain foreign troublemakers and fixing whatever mess they caused. Her duties usually were the ones scraped from the bottom of the barrel. For reasons she wasn\u2019t feeling prepared to disclose. Being called \u2018mistress\u2019 made her skin crawl a little, and she had to fight the urge to fold her arms as she continued.\u201cI apologise for not meeting your standards, Vidke\u201d Alva said, only half sarcastic. \u201cBut you see, we have had potential party members showing up for a week now. And if we were to invite each one to the tower, the Unlord will have had to welcome and offer explanations out so many times that he may well have lost his voice. Besides, his time is very precious. So, perhaps you should call me a shepherd instead of a guide. As I continue to attempt to herd you all out of trouble\u2019s way. Unsuccessfully, so it seems. I didn\u2019t realise asking people to be patient and respectful would be such an ordeal. And if you need enlightening, murder is in fact a crime in Thios. No matter who the victim. We also happen to have a very unique justice system that I can assure you, you will not deem pleasant even by the darkest standards. Otherwise, do as you please.\u201dAlva offered a smile that was far too bright to have followed her reply.Naturally, Rook was still positively on her side. Or at her heels. Her mood had depleted since their exhilarating ride, and she was absolutely not going to take him up on anything he had to offer. So, she looked between them, tiredness weighing on her eyes, and pulled her hood up.\u201cGoodnight, I shall see you at noon.\u201dAnd she took off, out of the alley and up into the bridges.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Alva watched Allahab retreat with quite a sour expression that she did not do so well at hiding."}}
