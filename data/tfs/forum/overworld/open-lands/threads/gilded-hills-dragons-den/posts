The sun hit the treetops of the valleys surrounding The Gilded Hills, making the area live up to its name by spreading a wondrous almost yellow glow across the vast treetops. The area had been home to a race of elves once, and ruins among the many rivers and creeks could be found, claimed by nature in the shape of vines and bushes attempting to cover up history. Hills in the hundreds and a few mountains were scattered across the woodland realm, making it extremely difficult to navigate on foot, unless one were to actually climb one to note the surrounding area.All sorts of wildlife inhabited the hills, even a few mythical creatures. Centaurs of low intelligence, Trolls of even lower intelligence and of course the fabled Griffins. The Griffins soared in the dozens above the trees, having made the trees their nests, the mountain caves their homes and sky their domain. If one were to find such magnificent creatures in heaps, it was sure to be here.\u00a0On the side of the largest mountain, one so large that snow covered the very tip of it - an opening in the mountainside lay. The entrance to cavern claimed the center of the mountainside and could be seen from miles away, two thousand feet tall and hundreds wide. The sheer dark emitting from the cave was so unnerving to wildlife that most creatures stayed away, or was it perhaps something that caused them to stray?\u00a0The smell of death and rot in the air around the area was pungent, the water ran with much less clarity in the surrounding rivers. Something had set to infest the area with its presence, causing a disruption in the natural balance that would've never occurred\u00a0in the time of the elves.\u00a0There was silence.
