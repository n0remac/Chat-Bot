There was no way of telling how long they would be in there or what awaited them. At first as they entered the recesses of the satchel, there was nothing but darkness, a leathery smell, and a very slight breeze. Then suddenly, whatever was underfoot gave way and they were falling through complete darkness, a tunnel with no sides that either of them could touch. Nothing about it seemed like the inside of a bag any more \u2013 if it ever had. The two samurai hit the ground near simultaneously, and rather suddenly, landing on a combination of dry leaves and spiky seed pods. Kojuro stood up, pushing up his helmet by the visor as it had fallen down over his eyes a little, and adjusting his swords. He pulled one of the spiky seed pods out from the fabric of his hakama, that had somehow stuck to him underneath the armour flaps. \u201cYasuke, you alright?\u201d he asked as he started to look around. This was no ordinary bag interior for there were trees growing here and a rolling mist that seemed to obscure everything beyond a few feet giving the place an eerie atmosphere. The barking of dogs could be heard from some way in the distance. \u201cHmm,\u201d he said, a smile broadening on his face as he tried to keep a lid on his excitement that they had ended up in what appeared to be a completely different world.

Not that he had believed it would be magic but IF he had, he had likely expected something like vibrant colors and odd five limbed unicorns. This was almost too mundane and... dared he say... somewhat boring.

The right words would have been 'I damn hope they are', but he had learned that those rough words didn't gain him much when speaking to nobles - they needed them silver lined. After all Kojuro was one of the most diplomatic people Yasuke had ever met - but it kinda rubbed him the wrong way because it meant Yasuke had to be like that too.

How do you get fire inside these funny gems?\" he asked, though the answer quickly seized to be the most interesting thing on his mind. 'Gems'. Who cared how they did it, getting one of these back to Kiyonai was bound to make him abundantly rich and he didn't hesitate to put one inside his armor when none of them were looking. Yasuke then closed the ring arranging them as if none were missing.

He'd obviously had this conversation with himself many times before.\"I've seen many people come through; thieves, highwaymen, murderers, soldiers, and pieces of all of the same.

Maybe a few moments back home is months here, but its just as likely that minutes here is years back there.\" The man shifted on the log on which he was sitting, and looked up at Kojuro.\"What I'm saying, Kojuro-dono, is that for all we know, by the time you made it here the beast you call Wuppo could have been dead and buried for decades, and anyone awaiting your return given you up for dead decades before that. We wont know until the next batch of unfortunates make it and tell us if the monster still possesses the bag.

He squinted at the newcomer, apparently having a hard time seeing in his advancing years. The old man reached down and picked up one of the crystals which continued to glow with yellow light.\"I didn't put the fire in these crystals, they grow like that in every hole in this hell.\" he began speaking again as he gazed into the yellow light. \"Back home, a single tiny chip off of one of these crystals would bring a small fortune, and here? They're so worthless they don't even warrant the effort it would take to steal them from an old man that can't defend them. There's more of these than eight men could carry in every cave in walking distance of here. Before you doze off again, Second Banana or whatever your name is, I think you'd like to know that these crystals are exactly why you two wont be spending much time here. You see for the same reason something that is entirely worthless here is priceless back home, the things from our world that are entirely worthless there are more valuable than life itself here. Wars are waged between the natives for things you would have tossed away without a second thought. You'll be going to the settlement because you are valuable. They will fight and die for your weapons, your armor, bits of paper, and even your bodies if they have to kill you to get your cooperation.\"It might be only now that the pair might realize that as the old man talked, the strange arrhythmic hollow clicking and clunking noise had become louder - from barely audible to now just above a whisper.
