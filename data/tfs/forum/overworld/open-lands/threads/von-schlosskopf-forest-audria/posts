The Scouts would most likely return with reports of the many small logging communities within, though otherwise the region seemed quite uninteresting. A small amount of time would pass, before to the camp marched a single man dressed in military garb, a wide smile upon his face and a hand held upon the grip of a large sword on his belt. Once he got within earshot of the Naimon company's encampment he gave a wide wave, before shouting to them. \"Hello! The Naimon company I presume? I have your down-payment with me! But your presence has not gone unnoticed, you see there are eyes everywhere in this forest. Dismantle your camp, and follow me, I will lead you to the site of the training, it is most certainly not for the public eye!\" ", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<div>As the men marched along there were the usual sounds of woods, but coupled every so often with just the hint of beautiful singing; sorrowful and mourning in a tongue long forgotten upon the wind.
