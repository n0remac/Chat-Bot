So uninteresting, in fact, that it's quite unique. Nobody in the town ever seems to have a smile on their face, nor do they let out so much as a chuckle of amusement. An observant stranger wandering through the town might notice an unusual lack of children playing games, or people singing while they work. Instead, the work is done in depressing silence, complemented by an oppressive fog. The children labor along with the adults, carrying heavy loads and wearing bitter expressions on their faces. The sun never seems to shine on Dullen, as it's constantly covered in a thick blanket of fog.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/OlWocSD.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/OlWocSD.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}, "post-76584": {"user": "Rudiger Dornmauer", "user_num": 2689, "timestamp": "1513387973000", "message": "Rudiger swayed in the saddle, his head hanging low, bouncing along with the movements of his destrier.
