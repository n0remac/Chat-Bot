It is a grim reminder of the midnight aristocracy that lords over these forsaken lands.  Dilapidated villages which have not yet fallen into disrepair still host a handful of reluctant cattle, and these serfs - little more than slaves - carry out mundane lives under the thirsty watch of their Vampiric Overlords.Ralf Valgard, otherwise known as the White Wolf, awakes with blurred vision.  As his senses come to, he finds himself bound in chains, suspended upside down, within a great feasting hall; somewhere nearby, an individual plays an organ.  \u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d he says to himself, trying to remember how he arrived at such a predicament.The stone walls were a dark grey color; great columns supported the high, arched, glass ceiling overhead.  Dull chandeliers hung down from various beams cutting across the ceiling from one column to the next.  Dimly-lit torches illuminated the otherwise dark interior.  A number of portraits hung on opposite sides of the feasting hall; Ralf observed that the women painted on them were heinously pretty, and the men were darkly handsome.The center of the room was dominated by a long wooden table, upon which a red table cloth was laid, which matched the red rug underneath the table.  Various goblets were carefully placed in front of each seat as if a family of nobles were preparing to drink wine.  A number of decorative arms and armor were set upon mannequins surrounding the hall.The organ player, whose melody was quite atrocious, was stuck in his own world, oblivious that Ralf had come to.  But another figure, who slouched in a nearby chair, lazily glanced in his direction and saw the revelation.\u201cAh!  Our guest has awoken!\u201d  A tall, stout creature of the night stood up and began making his way over.  He had pale skin reminiscent of the moon\u2019s color, blood-red eyes as red as\u2026 blood, and if Ralf was not so dumb he would have known him to be a vampire.The organ player stopped what he was doing and spun around.  He was particularly ugly; he had a bald head, one eye was bigger than the other, and he had a hunched-back.  A ghoul, or something similar.  \u201cUh-huh, mm, huh-huh,\u201d he responded shrilly.Ralf sighed, \u201cthank the Gods\u2026\u201dThe vampire laughed, \u201cyou are in chains, my friends, why do you thank the Gods?\u201d\u201cThat song...\u201d he responded, \u201cwas quite atrocious.\u201dThe ghoul growled and made a dash for Ralf, but the vampire raised a hand: \u201cdon\u2019t let him get to you, Geoffrey.  Your music is lovely, the prisoner only means to anger you.\u201d  The vampire shook his head, agreeing that the tune was fairly awful.  Nevertheless, the simple-minded Geoffrey was put to ease.\u201cNow\u2026\u201d the vampire began, \u201cyou\u2019re probably wondering how you got here.\u201d\u201cActually,\u201d Ralf replied, peering over at Geoffrey the Ghoul \u201cI was wondering what the hell that thing is.  And\u2026 and why you have not taken care of your jaundice.\u201d\u201cI do not have jaundice, you wretch!  I am a vampire!  Now, as for why you are here\u2026 it seems the White Wolf went on a little adventure as of late.  And when the butchery was done, the White Wolf retreated to a nice little cave within our domain.  And it was there one of the peasants found you.  He was promptly hanged for violating curfew, but not before alerting us to your presence.\u201cI considered killing you then and there\u2026 then draining your blood into our chalices and goblets so that we might consume your very life force.  But my wife, or one of them anyway, had quite the idea\u2026 what if drank not the blood of Ralf Valium, but the blood of the White Wolf\u2026?\u201d\u201cHaha,\u201d Ralf laughed, \u201cit is Valgard, not Valium.\u00a0 I shall tell you what will happen should you drink the blood of the White Wolf.  I have consumed so many barrels of the finest Isran wine that my blood has been replaced with alcohol, and you will fall over drunk on your first sip.\u201dThe vampire squinted, unsure of what to say next.  He shook his head, \u201cyou are quite the fool, Varan.\u201d  He turned to the ghoul, \u201cGeoffrey!  Fetch my wives!  And daughters!  And my daughter-wives!\u201d  He then turned back to Ralf \u201c... as for you\u2026 let us find out what makes you tick\u2026 what makes the White Wolf come out?\u201d", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://www.nataliebernard.com/uploads/2/5/0/6/25062309/darkcastle-bynataliebernard_1_orig.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><font size=\"5\"><u><b>Steihof Manor</b></u></font></div>"}, "post-93287": {"user": "Vasco Correa", "user_num": 2926, "timestamp": "1568470631000", "message": "Just as the doors opened to allow the flock of women through to the dining hall, a tiny little blackbird decided it wanted to fly in behind them.

So Vasco\u2019s arrival as a bird, whether noticed or not, was given little thought by the occupants.At least a dozen women walked in to accompany Lord Steihof, with Geoffrey coming in behind them.  They all wore Victorian-style clothing of exquisite quality, and of varying colors.  The aristocratic tastes of their previous mortal lives had certainly carried over, although their choices in color were darker than usual - dyes that did not reflect light so brightly.\u201cMiriam, my love!\u201d Lord Steihof smiled as his wife entered the room and made her way over to him.  As she came to her immortal husband\u2019s side the other ladies all took seats at the table.Miriam snapped at one of them, \u201cnot yet, Ophelia!  You\u2019ve work to do!\u201d  One of the women, the youngest of the bunch by appearance, sighed and got back up, leaving the room momentarily.  Miriam had the appearance of a well-to-do lady in her forties, albeit with vampiric qualities.  Her once-black hair, now a dark shade of grey, was painstakingly fixed.  She had bloodthirsty red eyes with lipstick to match, and her mascara-laden eyelashes stood out in stark contrast against her pale face.  She was the matriarch of the family, a strong-willed and iron-fisted Lady of the Manor.  \u201cHe is still\u2026 mortal,\u201d she criticized, \u201chave you not used any of the torturing devices?\u201d\u201cEr\u2026 no\u2026\u201d Lord Steihof replied.  Steihof was the father of about six of the women, having sired them through Miriam.  The other five were his children/grandchildren, having sired them by his daughters.  Ophelia, the poor girl, was the result of such a devilish conception.  But such was the practice to keep the bloodline pure.  His seated daughters were quite girlish, with annoying, high-pitched laughs.Miriam pushed her husband away and came face-to-face with the upside-down, suspended Ralf Valgard.  \u201cI am going to make you hurt, mortal, until the White Wolf shows his snarled snout.\u201d  The vampiress picked up a goblet and knife from the nearby table, licking the blade as she slowly made her way back over to Ralf.Gross, he thought; he had tasted metal before and there was nothing appetizing about it.  Wait, was she about to touch him with it?  He grimaced at the thought of a stranger\u2019s saliva touching his skin; chains rustled as his body recoiled in disgust.Miriam placed the point of the knife against Ralf\u2019s shoulder, and slowly applied pressure until it broke the skin.  Ralf was no stranger to minor cuts, but he gritted his teeth anyway, for her germs were now coursing through his bloodstream.  As the blood spilled from his shoulder she collected it in her goblet.  When it was almost full she brought it to her lips and gulped from it\u2026 savoring it\u2026 \u201cMmm, quite the treat.  Reminds me of Isran wine.\u201dIn an effort to tease her prisoner she poured a small drop of the blood onto the Varan\u2019s lips.  Quite the mistake.If it wasn\u2019t the smell of his own blood, then it was certainly the taste of it that got the Wolf\u2019s attention.  Whatever foul sorcery worked inside this Varan, it told the White Wolf that he was in danger.  \u201cUgh!  Ach!  No!\u201d Ralf closed his eyes and shook his head as the beast attempted to take control, squirming in his bonds.Miriam laughed and backed away.  \u201cThat was easy enough.\u201d  But the chains began to pop, snap, and break apart as the Varan\u2019s body began to morph and mutate.  There was no telling if the pressure applied by the bonds would hold the beast at bay\u2026 or come apart completely and free the accursed thing.It all depended on the actions of Vasco\u2026 if he continued to wait and observe, the White Wolf would show its teeth; but if he acted quickly, he could prevent such a transformation.  Ophelia was yet to return.

Two large iron doors served as the entrance, but they had been shoved open.Outside was a great stagecoach.  The carriage was large enough to house up to 6 occupants.  The exterior was a slick black color, with gothic features, glass windows, and lamps with an eerie and unnatural glow, and the interior was decorated in red velvet.  An organ had been built into the front of the carriage, and behind it sat Geoffrey.  He was playing a wild tune that summoned a host of ghastly red-eyed black horses intended to pull the coach.Unfortunately, Ophelia was busy trying to shew away three hellhounds.
