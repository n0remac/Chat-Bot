The caverns have remained undisturbed for centuries, yet something can be heard echoing in the deep. It's almost as if a gigantic creature inhales and exhales slowly within the depths, though it could be shifting earth. Whatever it is, nobody has been down there to check.Recently, cracks have begun to form in the formerly collapsed cavern entrance, and the stone has become worn down and brittle. Those massive undisturbed stalactites and reflecting pools might be exposed to the light of day for the first time in eons in the coming days. Without the outside world's disturbance, within the deeps lies an entire unique ecosystem, full of bioluminescent flora and fauna. It's a dangerous, habitat, and the creatures there are hostile to outside invaders, what predators that exist there jealously guarding their territory, while the fungi have developed various unique means of self-defence. Yet it is also an extremely beautiful sight to behold, the great chambers lit up in the darkness with a myriad of unique beasts and herbs.Even further into the complex there lies a chamber filled with gigantic glowing crystals, imbued with natural magical properties. The crystalline formations can grow up to thirty feet tall, and all pulse with a magical, multicoloured light. The magic that permeates the caverns can almost be felt even by the uninitiated, so powerful and ancient is it. The veil between ethereal and material is very thin here, and so those who find themselves in this cavern tend to experience powerful hallucinations. The beasts that live here, too, are so altered by the latent magic that their forms and functions are nearly beyond mortal reckoning.What else awaits in the depths? Only exploration can tell.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/736x/1a/be/0e/1abe0e2c1d3347e0543655a80c80f6aa.jpg", "http://static.zerochan.net/Shuriken.Rev.full.323373.jpg", "http://orig12.deviantart.net/faf2/f/2012/208/e/0/crystal_cave_by_joshualim91-d58spge.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/736x/1a/be/0e/1abe0e2c1d3347e0543655a80c80f6aa.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/>"}, "post-26487": {"user": "Freyja, Lady of the Moon", "user_num": 1149, "timestamp": "1456816203000", "message": "As Goraian troops march overhead, the slanted entrance to the caverns begins to weaken and crack.

The lone troop who had fallen attempted to hide and shield himself, he did it but clumsily due to the darkness. The patrol's leading battlemage had already sent a notice to the dragon lord Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui  when the caves had initially were found by the squadron. They watched the beast's  movements carefully as it rose from the earth.Fortunately for the troops, Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui  was almost already back from the battle between him and Asaph, Dream Hunter  and could accompany the unit and their sudden findings. The dragon glided in towards the squad, some of them looking up to see their lord and backed away from the ledge, giving Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui  a clear landing zone. His claws grasped the earth as he set himself down the ground shook under his weight. Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui 's face was still slightly wounded and burned from the previous battle and his arm trickled blood down the length of it, but he paid it no mind as if it wasn't there.

Glowing silver eyes open within the caverns' first chamber, peering out from the gloom. The eyes belong to the Lady of the Moon, who has been slumbering since the fall of Goraia, her job in the earthly realm finished...until now. Something ancient stirs within the land, awakening the Lady of the Moon. Something Freyja hasn't felt since the third collapse. She had taken part in banishing it forever...or so she thought. For the first time in eons, fear stirs within the heart of the dragon.

You arrived much more quickly than I had expected. Did the spirits of the forest not trouble you? They must be in a good mood on this day...or perhaps they can sense the importance of your duty here,\" she intones, surprised. Strangely enough, her voice is not muffled as it should be behind that wall of glistening metal. She looks over to the smaller woman and tilts her head just a touch.\"This is all you brought? Did I not emphasise the danger of this mission well enough?\" she asks, her tone cool and not entirely pleased.\"Well...she will have to do. Come, humans, the entrance is treacherous, but I will guide you safely to the bottom.\"She turns about and steps back into the murky gloom of the cavern entrance, but it doesn't stay cloaked in shadow for long, as from Freyja's armoured hand springs a small orb of pure light, its pale blue glow reminiscent of that of a full moon as it drifts through the entrance, revealing a sharp drop off into a deep black void, the light reflecting off a thick grey mist that conceals what lay below. There are already several rappelling ropes hooked onto large steel stakes protruding from the edge of the cliff face, enough for a small battalion to jump in without much difficulty. It's clear Freyja was expecting more than two. She beckons for the two to follow, casting a second ball of light into the foggy blackness to illuminate the way down, although it does little to reveal what awaits at the bottom.\"The veil of shadow, that which separates the material from the ethereal. It is so thin here as to be visible. It has weakened in the days since my awakening. We must be cautious,\" says Freyja.

A kaleidoscope of colors all around in this magical kingdom. It was hard to differentiate them and stop himself from being overwhelmed but he could manage thanks to years of practice. \"We did take your threat seriously. That's why I brought back up.\"While this statement certainly sounded arrogant, and it was, his tone didn't convey it as he didn't see it as arrogance. Sun Marshals were the elite of the elite of Isra the most powerful nation on the planet. Each marshal was meant to be, at the very least, the equal of a platoon of soldiers or more by themselves. Hell, to be fair he alone was worth far more than that so to him this seemed like a reasonable force to combat the current threat.
