Today was even more painful than that but he was tougher now than he'd been back then. Thump..............

Each movement brings about new agony as inch by inch he comes to closer to her, just as she reached out for him in her dreams he reached out to her in his haze of pain.

The pair sit in her hands for a moment; one handle rounded and molded as if for her specifically; the other a bit bulkier, with a more defined shape that her fingers don't quite wrap around.She flourishes them for a second, the one in her right hand held above her shoulder and the one in her left held about chest height. She throws the one in her right hand first, extending her arm with a flick of her wrist, her gaze flicking over to find her target. The curved blade spins through the air, its single edge carving a path towards one of the yellow robed acolytes.Barely a moment passes before she throws the other blade, her arm folding and pressing across her chest before arcing up past her face. She releases the blade as her arm straightens, the triangular point flying straight as an arrow in a path that will find a different acolyte's chest.As soon as the second blade releases her fingertips she slides backwards, her personal gravity tilting the world around her. She leans into it, tilting forward to face the ground as her feet trace paths through the dirt. Her right arm returns to the bandoleer slung across her chest, dancing up and down the length before pulling out another weapon, this time a sturdy dagger sheathed near her hip. She pulls the weapon free and swings it up into a defensive position, her left hand finding a weapon of its own as she slides to a halt, perhaps three or four meters behind the others.", "link_list": ["/post/80460/thread", "/user/2797"], "image_list": ["//storage.proboards.com/6046952/avatar/glJQOMnhbpdObDFVRLRd.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@aylith\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/80460/thread\" timestamp=\"1520904904\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-2797\" title=\"Aylith\"><img alt=\"Aylith Avatar\" src=\"//storage.proboards.com/6046952/avatar/glJQOMnhbpdObDFVRLRd.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/80460/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1520904904000\" title=\"Mar 12, 2018 17:35:04 GMT -8\">Mar 12, 2018 17:35:04 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-2797 group-0\" href=\"/user/2797\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@aylith\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Aylith</span></a></span> said:</div>The Speaker holds out a hand toward the Guide, and waves at Tsatsa and Talia (not seeming to notice Mordred). \"These are your great dark warriors?

He looks at the Speaker, and laughs a high-pitched, cold laugh. \"Of course by myself, I could not open the gate. But I have my own friends now. And all of yours are fighting all of mine...and where does that leave me? Oh yes.\"The Guide rams the sword into a segment of the ground overlaid with a mass of specific runes and lines.

Beneath the hood, the Guide's body shakes, rippling almost as if its possessed of a peculiar, alien motion. He finally seems to \"move\", raising a disjointed, warped gray arm. The Guide looks at his arm for a split second, as the Speaker is charging, exercising his will over the matter and ancient \"flesh\".

However, a few of them manage to rally, standing still for a moment as another chants something unintelligible and waves a glowing staff over their friends' heads.<br><br/>A moment later the three affected cultists glow with strange energy. Turning to face Talia, they move suddenly, bodies blurring from sheer speed as they close in on her in mere seconds. One leaps above, a greatsword he should by no means be able to be carrying swinging like a star toward Talia's face, while the other two circle in from the sides, swinging a mace and a staff at her in turn.<br/><br/>The Guide kneels, picking up a shortsword one of the other cultists had dropped on the ground. He looks at the Speaker, and laughs a high-pitched, cold laugh. \"Of course by myself, I could not open the gate. But I have my own friends now. And all of yours are fighting all of mine...and where does that leave me? Oh yes.\"<br/><br/>The Guide rams the sword into a segment of the ground overlaid with a mass of specific runes and lines. The Speaker screams loudly, rising to their feet and jumping at him. \"You fool! You were defeated once before, and I will defeat you agai-\"<br/><br/>The Guide does not so much turn, as shift his entire body around, piece by piece, like some horrible moving picture. Beneath the hood, the Guide's body shakes, rippling almost as if its possessed of a peculiar, alien motion. He finally seems to \"move\", raising a disjointed, warped gray arm. The Guide looks at his arm for a split second, as the Speaker is charging, exercising his will over the matter and ancient \"flesh\". The bones crack and splinter, reforming back into their original substance, as the flesh dissolves into a gooey, light-grey substance, which swiftly twists into an elongated, conical shape, and then a more spherical, twisted shape. A mace.<br/><br/>The Guide swings their new \"arm\", and a resounding crack is heard, as the Speaker flies backward across the arena. Trembling from the effort, the Guide laughs sharply, lowering to their knees and focusing on something....else.<br/><br/>Charging....(1).<div class=\"quote_clear\"></div></br></div></div>Talia's personal gravity shifts once more, pulling her towards the staff-user.

The audible rattling of his metallic armor did well to ward off most animals that would lurk about, but he would keep his wits about him all the same. His torches had all but drained, and his supplies were relatively low in short order. Moving at night was an inconvenience for him, but a necessity when the hot sun threatened to cause him to over-heat. Even his emergency rations and canteens of purified water were teetering dangerously on depletion.\u00a0 The young Siris had come far along his journey, with plenty to show for in regards to the dangers of his travels. From his armored shoes plodding along the softened terrain, to the marring along various portions of his fortified armor.

He wore it with pride, as he should when it has been passed down from his father and bestowed to him to don!\u00a0\u00a0Cerulean eyes scour his surroundings with great care, what little remained of his dying torch offering a poor idea of where he ought to be stepping.

His torch would be kept low to the ground as to leave his positioning harder to discern, before steadily making his way toward the light. Keeping an eye on traps of some sort would likely be in his best interests, but provided there were none?\u00a0The youthful squire would plod his way closer to the encampment, almost reflexively going through the motion of counting how many individuals laid before him. From what he could glean from his cursory glance was that the camp belonged to one individual, along with a horse of sorts. Trusting his guts instincts on whether to approach or not, he would smother his torch with the softened mud that laid beneath him, and proceed to enter the camp. His right hand tightens upon the hilt of his blade, but he does not radiate excess hostility.\u00a0\"Oi, do not be alarmed! I am a traveler of sorts, seeking my way to the nearest town. Would you happen to be able to guide me to the location of such? My provisions are low, and thus I can not afford to stumble through this forestry much longer.

There was a smooth richness to his voice, albeit a bit scratchy with the lack of water. Dirt caked his cheeks and sweat had matted his hair to a degree, but no one said traveling was pretty.\u00a0Despite this, he did his best to look presentable and maintain his distance to the outer ring of the camp.

Tracking had never truly been her strong suit and of course, that was the one skill needed to complete her newest mission. \"How do I get myself mixed up in these things?\" She muttered in complaint as she dusted off her knees. The last few villages she had past through were all whipped into a tizzy because of some beast running rampant through the connecting woods, attacking men women and children alike. Not being at home and trying to maintain a low profile, she'd tried to avoid it and let what be, be. But of course, with her luck, it was not to be. The last village she had gone through, had been attacked while she was passing through. The beast- she hadn't even gotten a clear look- had attempted to make off with two children... And she couldn't let it pass. She managed to free the children from the beast but it had gotten away before any finishing blow could be dealt. And it was just moments later that the village pounced and begged that she slay the beast. Another sigh left her as she twisted her back to relieve some strain. She couldn't in good conscience leave them to fend for themselves so she had given her word to rid the land of the beast before moving on and now she had already lost 2 nights to searching. \"No luck again.\" She muttered miserably as she accepted defeat for the night once more, deciding to set up camp for the night when she noticed a campfire in the distance and distantly heard a voice. She cocked a brow before she adjusted her path towards the spot. Perhaps this camper-or rather campers- had some idea as to the whereabouts of the beast. It was worth a shot at the very least. She walked forward, not disguising her trod so as not to appear to be sneaking up on them, just out of the tree line to catch the last words. \u201c-not afford to stumble through this forestry much longer.

Shifting its weight from a relaxed posture with one hoof cocked, it came alert, with its ears pinning back in anticipation. Twitching its ears reflexively, it let out a soft knicker, regarding the squatting man in a sideways glance with its large, dark eyes. \"I hear it Bob,\" he softly soothed the horse out the side of his mouth, slowly laying the piece of cloth and metal to his side, and letting his hand rest on the handle of a sword that lay inconspicuously in its scabbard at his side. He didn't let on that he knew the being was out there in the woods, preferring to let whatever it was think it had the advantage on him. Which, if he was being entirely honest with himself, it probably did since he wasn't wearing his armor. The voice of a younger man, or something that could approximate the baritone of a young man, came rumbling into the campsite, before the apparition of a human appeared across the fire from the squatting man. Studying the younger man with his good eye, the squatting man nodded, and said, \"Well, I'm sorry to state, but I have very little idea how to get to the next village or inn in the dark. But, feel free to stake a place next to the fire Master Siris, and rest your bones for a bit. Won't hurt to have a little company, especially on a night like this.\" Reaching into a saddle bag that rested next to his sword, the squatting man produced a piece of jerky with some hardtack, and offered both to the squire.Bob let out a louder knicker, turning his attention towards the opposite direction that Siris had came from, as if telling the squatting man that he had missed what Bob was trying to tell him.
