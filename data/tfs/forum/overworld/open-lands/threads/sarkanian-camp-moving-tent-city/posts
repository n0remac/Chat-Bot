By the time a month had passed, Nemeas' camp had grown to thousands of tents as surviving soldiers and the remains of the Sarkanian people gathered around his standard in hope for salvation. But the camp was too large and the people too many for the ruined landscape to sustain them for long and as threats began to grow all around them, Nemeas made the choice to lead his people north.That was over ten years ago. For over a decade the Sarkanians have followed Nemeas on one of the largest migrations ever seen; one hundred thousand civilians, children and warriors, along with all of their animals, facing the hardships of being thrust into a nomadic lifestyle in their search for a new home. Nations and kings have refused them, turned them away, used them as mercenary fodder and attacked them in open war as though they were nothing more than a barbarian menace - and through it all, the Sarkanians have persevered in the hope of finding a new land to call their own.\u00a0When the Sarkanians come to a halt, they pitch a great city of thousands of tents guarded by their soldiers as foragers and sometimes even raiders go out into the surrounding areas and gather supplies through trade, foraging or force. The Sarkanians may stay in a single encampment for months, in which case they will build temporary walls of wood around them for protection. Like a mighty beast, the Sarkanians strip their surroundings of what they need and then pack up and continue their journey.\u00a0The Kingdom of Sarkania was known for being rather culturally diverse, as in the past it either peacefully absorbed or militarily annexed several neighboring states.
