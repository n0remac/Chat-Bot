Outcast describes its location, nestled in the mountains of the north miles from any other population center it was constructed by some long forgotten kingdom and forgotten about. At least until a band of mercenaries took up residence in it to use it as their primary base of operations. This troop was called, what else, The Outcasts.Lead by Sarim Nay an exile from Sakand, the Outcasts found the keep during an excursion to hunt a wyvern that had been terrorizing a nearby village. The Wyvern had taken to roosting in the belfry. After slaying the beast the band decided to take up residence in the unused keep, seeing it as an excellent spot to stockpile supplies, train new recruits, and set out to fulfill various contracts. While it was removed from civilization it was the kind of removed that made many places a reasonable trip, rather than a few places an easy one.The nearby village was happy to have the protection of a mercenary band close by and the mercenaries were happy to have a place willing to trade them fresh produce, meat, and ale. Thus as is the way of such things an alliance was born and the village prospered along with the troop. Especially since the troop's proclivity to recruit anyone regardless of race or creed made the village more understanding. This lead to a boom in population as peoples who would not be accepted elsewhere to flock to it, not unlike distant Isra.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.redd.it/dwpo3nz29zj11.jpg"], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><img alt=\" \" src=\"https://i.redd.it/dwpo3nz29zj11.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/></div>"}, "post-88868": {"user": "Storyteller", "user_num": 3343, "timestamp": "1548385792000", "message": "From the ridge, they could see figures on the parapets of Outcast Keep. Two of them, separated by the burden between them. It was a heavy burden, though not in the physical sense, its weight did not lessen as it was sent over the wall tumbling to the ground far below. With the benefit of distance, lies could be told about what those burdens were but the realities of war were hard to ignore. As supplies dwindle, rations need to be cut and to preserve as many lives as possible those cuts affect soldiers last. The first to have their rations cut are the elderly, the sick, and the infirm. Those who will pass quickly once the food gets scarce. They may even be the lucky ones, granted a peaceful death rather than one ending in quick brutal violence. Of course, you couldn\u2019t keep the bodies in the keep. If they were left to rot they would fester and soon disease would run rampant behind the walls. High in the mountains, there was nowhere to put the dead, nowhere to bury them, nothing to do with them except chuck them over the walls and hope, pray, that succor would come before the wolves got to the bodies. It was a vain hope though and honestly those behind the walls were more concerned with the wolves coming for them. Saria stood still as a statue, as silent as the night as she watched each body drop. One, two, three, four. Her keen elvish eyes told her a little bit about each bundle and as the last dropped a single tear rolls from the corner of her eye. Had that one been just a bit smaller than the others? Who but an elf could say at this distance?The march back to Outcast Keep had been long and hard. When they\u2019d stopped to rest she\u2019d told them what she could of her people. Of how the keep was found and founded, of how the village grew and prospered, how it became known as a place where any would be accepted. Eventually, she spoke of how a rival mercenary band raided the village, of the sortie Captain Nay had led when they\u2019d spotted the fires from their walls, of keeping the troops of the New Moon Brother\u2019s long enough to get the survivors evacuated to the keep. Of the fight up the mountain path that had seen nearly a tenth of their forces killed or wounded before they closed the gates once more. \u201cWith our numbers so reduced, we knew we would need succor,\u201d Saria says as they continue along the far ridge moving carefully to avoid attracting the attention of the enemy scouts. \u201cUnfortunately, the only exit from the keep is not large enough for a full evacuation without drawing attention. The exit is narrow, only one may leave at a time and it is close enough to their camp that we would draw attention should we try to evacuate through it.\u201d And indeed that was the case as the enemy encampment was within bowshot of their current position. While the small group was avoiding detection for now, with the scouts and sentries mostly focused on the keep, it was unlikely that a larger force would evade detection for long. \u201cStill, perhaps with your aid, we can use it to stage an ambush. Or mayhaps even break the siege in a more straightforward way. Strategy and Tactics are not my forte, for that you will have to talk to Captain Nay.\u201d She finishes in her hushed whisper as they come to a stop next to a large boulder, settled against the cliff. Moving to the back of it she motions the group to follow as she slips in between the gap that the leaning slab of rock makes with the cliff face. It does not look large enough to hold her yet with only a bit of work she vanishes into it. Clearly, this was their secret way back into the fortress.

The half-elf leads the way further down the tunnel, the smooth path gradually sloping down and then curving around until they were pointed toward the keep. It is a long walk through the musty corridor but eventually the floor slopes up once more and the group soon find themselves exiting out of a trap door into a storage room within the keep proper. \"Captain Saria, you have returned.\" As the four pull themselves out of the hole they would hear a guard, doubtless posted to watch the trap door, greeting the half-elf. A quick exchange of pleasantries is made before Saria introduces the group.\"These are all I could gather up.\" She says and the guard frowns.\"Only four?\" The young man asks and she nods her head.\"Yes, but two of them are magical healers so they may do the work of more than just four,\" Saria assures the young man before changing the subject. \"Where is Commander Nay? I should deliver the report and our recruits with all due haste.\"This question makes the young man's features deepen and he points towards the door. \"He is in the baily, there is an execution today.

There were not many soldiers in the crowd, just a gaggle of villagers. Men and women whose features were starting to go gaunt from cut rations, eyes carrying the haunted look that only those recently re-introduced to the horrors of the world can have.Their attention was affixed on the mercenaries near the wall. A man with strikingly\u00a0red-hair was kneeling before a headsmen's block, his eyes dark and filled with malicious\u00a0hatred. Before him stood a veritable mountain of a man with ebony skin and grim continence that was more than a rival to the kneeling man's clear vitriolic\u00a0hatred.\u00a0\"Red Salem, you stand accused of the rape and murder of Beatrice Twilsbury\u00a0of the village of Dulth.

As such, blood will be paid with blood.\" With a single determined motion the scimitar rises and falls, a final vile epitaph is a spat, a spray of blood stains the dirt, the thud of a head hits the ground.\u00a0The crowd begins to disperse and Saria approaches. \"Commander Nay, I am returned from my mission and I bring you these four recruits.\"The Commander looks up as Saria approaches, the half-elf electing to act as though there wasn't a body currently being dragged off to the wall for disposal. \"Excellent.\" Turning to the group Salim salutes the four, going ramrod stiff and slamming his right fist against his heart. \"I am Salim Nay, Commander of the Outcasts.

We are having a strategy meeting tonight that you will be attending, I am hoping fresh eyes may come up with a plan for survival that has thus far eluded us.\" Under normal circumstances, he would never ask strangers to attend his war council but desperate times called for desperate measures. \"Dismissed.\"  Meanwhile, in the great hall, Saria nods as Aliandre speaks. \"Herbs and bandages are one thing we don't lack for.\" She says with a sigh. \"My rangers are able to slip out to gather basic supplies. Herbs are easy enough to get through the tunnel, I just wish we could squeeze enough food through it to keep the people fed.\" Dragging a dear carcass through the small opening wasn't practical and taking the time to butcher it and bring morsels of food through would likely lead to the tunnel being discovered. On top of that, the army below was already driving most of the local game out of the valley. Nothing prevents the healing from going as intended and those who receive help are quite grateful. The young boy even going to far as to hug Treva when his arm stops aching. The application of exuberance is a welcome one and helps to lift the general malaise that had fallen upon the great hall. It didn't take the sharpest eye to recognize that morale was a problem within Outcast Keep, but who could blame them? Food stocks were dwindling and once they were gone so was their very way of life.When they are finished Commander Nay makes an appearance. \"Thank you for your help.\" He says in grave tones. \"You have a few hours, I suggest you use them to rest up. There is a meeting in the command room this evening and I ask you to attend. We are hoping fresh eyes will help us find a way out of this. Saria will fetch you when it is time.\" With that the Commander takes his leave.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Commander Nay returns Kehy's smile when one of the various desert dialects is close enough to facilitate more direct communication.

It had turned out he'd lost his parents at some point, and the high tensions inside the keep had kept the adults from realizing someone needed to take care of him.

She had been keeping an eye on him, she explained, but with all the death and stress in the keep, he had slipped her mind in the deluge. Artun, she learned was the boy's name, was very reluctant to leave Treva's leg, prefering it seemed to become a permanant fixture.

She wanted to take a mental checklist of different choke points inside the key. Open field fighting was not her forte, but narrow dungeons filled with undead were similar to the insides of the stone-walled structure. A few places near the living quarters looked passable, and it was probably designed that way in the event it was sieged. She would mention her thoughts to Nay when he saw him again.\u00a0\u00a0 Taking to walkway on the outer wall, she was quite taken with the view out over the surrounding countryside.

Minutes after they left they paused as the fireball spell went off. Turning back to look Saria and Syiad grinned as they see both a major blow to the enemy forces and a nice distraction for their next bit of work. When they are finally near the pond it is Saria who goes, the half-elf moving like a shadow through the camp as distressed soldiers waited for orders or charged off to try and help put out the fire.

His grey hair was in need of a wash, he was missing a few teeth, but his eyes were still bright and sharp and his humor, while of the gallows variety, had not yet fled him. As she talked to the guard more of the men on the wall would stop in to join the conversation and depending on how she comports herself Alliandre could find herself in a position to boost the morale of the mercenaries this night. Word of what Treva had done for young Artun spread quickly through the Bailey where most of the villagers were kept. Moral and trust had been at a low among the refugees but a single act of kindness by one of the, to this point, seemingly hardened mercenaries, was enough to salve some of that tension. For at least a few hours the people of the lost village of Outcast found themselves murmuring less darkly and instead focused more on the few positives they had that night. It wouldn't last indefinitely but hopefully, it would keep morale at an acceptable level long enough for a plan to be concocted.
