The song was not sad, nor particularly joyful, it called forth a sense ease of one sitting in their tent, watching the river nearby rise while enjoying one's pipe. The stew quietly simmering away, the occasional hiss of the fire...  Hester's vocals were not in common, by some other langue the Lyre demanded, it had a gentleness to it, with rolling syllables that promised warmth, and peace... So was the scene before Hester's closed eyes.  A rough man at his camp, peace gracing his otherwise weathered face... A peace he'd been missing for such a long time. Taken from him again and again, by war or by fate it could note have been said, but he carried no sword now, nor bow, narry a weapon was near him...  For where he walked there were no need for such things any longer--- Hester damned the lyre... It seemed Hester had focused to much on the absence of the husband... With any luck the old woman would not be able to understand the word she'd just spoken. And simply enjoy the otherwise pleasant song she was singing.

Perhaps one day I shall have my husband take me somewhere warm and nice, on a journey of our own.\"Lait and Sucette glanced at each other, but said nothing. After an awkward pause, Sucette took advantage of a break between songs to turn to Hester, taking a long sip from her wine before speaking.\"That sounded lovely, Miss Fairweather.

It is a journey of self discovery really.\"As Hester finished the Lady's attention had turned and he could avoid her iron gaze but he did not yet compliment the bard.
