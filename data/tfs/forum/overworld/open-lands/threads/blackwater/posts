An eldritch swampland of ill repute strategically wedged between a host of warmongering nation-states.  Commonfolk believe the thick forests and pox-ridden bogs are home to evil spirits, hags, and ancient horrors.  Nay, say I!  The stillwaters bubble with toxin and the putrid disease it carries addles the minds of the lesser folk.  A mere antidote is all one needs to survive the so-called \u2018horrors\u2019 that call the Darkwald their home.\"-Master Zoroaster Alabastar, arcanologist who disappeared in the DarkwaldThere are two main roads running through the Darkwald.  One runs north to south, the other cuts through east to west.  The Vorstuga, with its estuary in the northwest, carves it way to the southeast.  A number of smaller rivers, streams, and creeks branch off and flow into the many lakes, ponds, and bogs scattered throughout the dark forest.In the center, where the roads and the river meet, is the Hallows Inn.  The red-brick tavern is two-stories high with a black shingled roof and a stone base.  The first floor is where patrons will find the bar, as well as a hearth and places to sit and relax.  A large, spacious room on the westwing is yet unused.  The cellars beneath offer storage, and the second floor provides room-and-board for those with coin.  A stable rests on the eastwing.  The innkeep\u2019s name is Sloan, and he is a short but stout, balding man.The Hallows Inn was financed by a company known as Blackwater, who owns a number of warehouses on the bank of the Vorstuga.  The tavern\u2019s most common patrons include merchants who sail up and down the river, as well as the dockworkers who live in their homes nearby.", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/3601/blackwater"], "image_list": [], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><font size=\"5\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Blackwater</font><br><br/><font size=\"1\"><a href=\"http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/3601/blackwater\" rel=\"norewrite\" target=\"_blank\">Click here for more information!</a></font></br></div>"}, "post-93495": {"user": "Grey", "user_num": 3103, "timestamp": "1572043921000", "message": "When the League had dispatched Grey to Voruta on an assignment they offered little in the way of details; but such were their ways: vague and mysterious.

Blackwater, still in its infancy, was like a beacon of hope in the gods-forsaken marshland of the dark forest.  Now traders and travelers alike could find respite at the Hallows Inn, whereas their predecessors had risked death camping on the side of the main roads.\"Ho, there,\" Grey pulled the reins of Maggie, his mare, then dismounted and led her further into the stables.  There were hitching posts, troughs of water, and hay inside - reasonable accommodations for a traveler's mount to rest without being in the weather.  Grey fed Maggie an apple, pet her cheek, and then made his way to the Hallows Inn.The inn was on the north side of the Vorstuga, its entrance facing south.  There were a number of houses belonging to the dockworkers, who loaded and unloaded cargo for the League on the banks of the river.  A few small ships were moored at the docks and goods were transported back and forth from the vessels and warehouses.  The League's foreman was certainly in that area, but Grey would visit his old friend Sloan first, who ran the tavern.The wooden door creaked open and the weary traveler entered.  The hearth was burning brightly and pork was being roasted over the coals.  Groups of carousing merchants and their guards were enjoying themselves at the tables, their bellies full of meat and alcohol.\"Oi, over here lad!\"  Sloan waved at Grey from behind the bar.  \"Worry not, got vodka on hand if that's what you want.\"\"No thanks,\" Grey responded.  \"Still need to see the foreman.\"Sloan nodded, \"right.  Everything turn out okay?\"\"It got messy, but the job's done.  Won't be seeing them anymore.  What about you?  How's life in the bog?\"Sloan laughed.  \"It's not too bad.  With the League at my back I want for nothing.  Folk might get a little rowdy after one too many drinks, but I can handle them well enough.  Speaking of which... League's looking for a sheriff to keep order, but I'm not sure who they're considering.\"Grey shrugged, \"something stable?  Might be worth looking into.\"\"Sheriff Grey,\" Sloan chuckled, \"I've a job for you already.\"\"Oh?\"The innkeep shrugged.  \"Ah, why the hell not?  See those fellows over there?\" he pointed to a group of well-dressed foreigners and Grey nodded.  \"They arrived yesterday evening.  They trade in exquisite luxury furniture.  So I paid them for a couch.  They left, then returned empty-handed, and been drinking and carousing about all day.  Every time I ask about it they refuse to speak.  Suppose to be a nice couch too.\"\"I could make them talk,\" Grey offered.\"Aye, don't doubt you could.  Just one problem.  See those men with the curved swords?\"  Another band of foreigners, these ones armed, sat nearby.  \"Bodyguards.  Can't do much with them nearby.  Maybe ask around and see if you can find some muscle.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "When the League had dispatched Grey to Voruta on an assignment they offered little in the way of details; but such were their ways: vague and mysterious.

It was for the good of his people, it was the only reason that he was here to start. The little murky town settled in a set of woods that linked up towards his own had turned hostile the instant that he'd stepped in it. Once elven trees were twisted into something darker, uglier, and these whispered of secrets instead of the growth of the world around him. The shade settled into his bones digging through the skin making them ache. The instant he stepped into the opening of the town they released their grip and allowed him breathing room. It was with this relief that he ventured further even if the crowd was shadier than he expected. Carrying himself with head held high his cloak was drawn over dark leather armor. The long line of his bow which was settled over his left shoulder, and over his cloak, would be the only thing that looked to be of truth worth upon his person.\u00a0 His quiver drawn over the cloak fed through an opening. There were also holes allowed for where he'd had then sewn to put his arms through the cloak providing warmth to his core three dark buckles going down the center of his chest. Dismounting from his steed the horse was thick, steady, and more suitable for farm-work than what he required of it now. Still the beast had served him well and he would look for a stable finding it in the form of the local tavern which held space enough for him. Checking with the stable boy he would pay the few coins necessary for feed and water and take care of the tack himself. He would leave the saddle on the edge of the stable door with a saddlebag placed over the edge of it as well. The horse would bite anyone who came near. Generally he would have shrugged off many of his weapons too, he did hang his bow on the back wall and his quiver beneath it, but left the short blade upon his hip and a dagger that was settled in his boot. Leaving the stable for the warmth of a fire within the tavern itself. The door opening the wind that surrounded him raised his cloak showing the molded leather over his form, the pads on his thighs, and his thick boots in the same worn brown. He wore bracers on his forearms that were tied in the middle running along the length of them. By all appearances, he was an archer if one judged by the way he was muscled with a medium build but tense shoulders. He approached Sloan a seat down from Grey missing the last part of their conversation but waving down the bartender his voice weary, \"Do you have a special today, sir?\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Bart found himself put outside of his comfort zone with this trip.
