Misaika started rubbing the surface of her palms together before cupping them seemingly giving shape to something emitting a clear white light.

If the bird would be able to reach Dirk in time before he was enveloped by Wormwood, it would mount itself on top of Dirk, as a bell jar of protective light would manifest and surround Dirk protecting him from the physical effects of Wormwood's spells - as well as Dirk's own folly as it could not be broken from within by anyone not proficient in magic. And for anyone outside trying to affect it directly, it would leave a bad sting on touch which would only be worse if the entity carried darkness in his heart. Of course such a quick spell was not immune to being broken, but for now it might protect the armored guy from a terrible fate. \"What does... that thing do..?\" Misaika asked Eira muted referring to the string of course. Misaika glanced around and thought that the key to breaking free could be to remove any enchantments that had been put on this place - and she might have a plan brewed to do so.\"Can you give me some distraction from those two?
