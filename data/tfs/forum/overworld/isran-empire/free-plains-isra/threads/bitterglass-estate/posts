Both the mansion and its surrounding grounds are surrounded entirely by a twelve-foot wrought-iron fence, with gates on the north and south sides. From outside the fence, it is nearly impossible to see the mansion through the heavy fog that shrouds the entire estate. Behind the mansion sits four hundred acres of forest, all within the fence. Both the north gate (in front of the mansion) and the south gate (leading into the forest) currently have Isran guards standing watch day and night to prevent anyone from entering.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/001/018/653/large/andrew-suryadi-spooky-mansion.jpg?1438285133"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/001/018/653/large/andrew-suryadi-spooky-mansion.jpg?1438285133\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}}
