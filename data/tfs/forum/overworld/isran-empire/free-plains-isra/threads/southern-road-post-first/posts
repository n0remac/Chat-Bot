Lookout for single individuals is especially high in the southern portion of the Free Plains, as it is suspected that if Goraia will make an attack, it will be a small team - or even just a single individual - intending to attempt a decapitation strike. The defenses of the Southern Gate are also more numerous relative to other regions. As such, the scouts would find it difficult to proceed safely. Griffin lookout patrols have been temporarily increased in the south, and the farms are only located near to the river; the rest of the plains are simply plains, without as much vegetation as all that.
