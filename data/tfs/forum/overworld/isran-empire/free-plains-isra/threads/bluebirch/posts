The deep rumble of thunder, like the rumbling belly of a starving giant, resounded through the cold air, heralding the arrival of the storm which had sat brewing in the mountains for days, if the travelling merchants were to be believed. Thankfully, the intrepid Fiona Blythe had arrived just in time to hear the first few drops of rain land on the top of her coach as it pulled into the small town of Bluebirch. What business did someone like her have here? She usually catered to those of wealth and sophistication, her prices reflected that, but perhaps she had felt a change of heart. Or she had other ideas. She steps out of the coach and into the dirt under her. If she didn't hurry, that dirt would soon turn to mud, something she would rather not deal with. She could smell the rain coming in the air, and the flashes of lightning and rumbles of thunder was only getting closer and closer together. With a heft of her bag, she makes a beeline for the inn she had been told about. The attractive woman is quick to cross the threshold of the inn, just before the rain came bucketing down. The next person was less lucky, stepping in as if they had just walked out of a waterfall. Poor bastard. Of course, nobody paid them much mind, instead she found herself with more than one pair of eyes on her. It was to be expected, as she wore her low cut, red dress with the gold thread lining and pattern work. The silver dove sat on her ample bosom, no doubt pushed up tactically, and her makeup was superb tonight. Though, she was almost sure nobody would be able to pay her prices, but perhaps it would result in a free drink or two. She makes her way to the bar with a practiced stride and confidence in each step. \u201cQuite the weather.

There's something about stealing away someone's attention in such a way, to turn them into clay in one's hands, to be morphed and sculpted into something of use. As she understands it, this lad is getting to the point where he would do literally anything she asks, should it come to it. That makes him useful, a tool to be used when the situation demands it. She takes the key before passing a small bag of coins over the counter, each one with the gleaming face of the empress herself. Not the grubby coins they use in the small town, but polished, clean coins from the city. Freshly minted? Personally polished? It wouldn't be of much a surprise if the latter is the case, considering how clean and well cut the woman is. Either way, it was enough for the room, and probably just a little more, enough that Fiona wouldn't likely miss it, but enough that it may very well make a difference. That is Fiona, some would say, a selfish taker, but a generous giver. Though nobody really knows about the former until it's too late. \u201cThank you, sir,\u201d she says with a bright smile, flashing her pretty clean teeth. \u201cI'll be sure to let you know should I need any assistance. For now though, I intend to enjoy the rain from the comfort of the room provided.\u201d She hefts her back onto her back again, a bag that doesn't match her outfit very well, but who was complaining? She doubts there are many fashion critics in these parts. \u201cGoodbye for now.\u201d With that, she turns about and heads for the stairs, and straight up then to find her room. She finds the room to be a cozy spot, nothing to write home about, but it had that rustic flair to it, one that many may overlook. Its to her specifications though, roomy enough and facing east. She opens the door to listen to the rain come down before dumping her bag on the bed, but she doesn't move to open it.

She sits back and enjoys the cool breeze that came from the open window, and she lets the sound of the rain wash over her, a somewhat soothing sound that brought peace to her, much like the sound of a babbling brook in a spring forest, or the silence of a snowy day in the countryside. Any time to get out of the hustle and bustle of the city was a time Fiona could truly enjoy. The splashing of boots in the rain catches her attention though, and before long she finds herself at the windowsill, peering over the side to see what the rush is. Undoubtedly to get out of the rain, she imagines, but there's an urgency to the figure's gait that makes her think that perhaps something else is afoot. The shouting confirms this for the woman, making her furrow her neatly shaped eyebrows. Shouting rarely meant much good, not when the offender isn't advertising turnips for three gold a piece. A rip off price, in Fiona's mind, which is why she rarely goes to the markets in the richer parts of the city anymore. She reaches into her bag and retrieves her daggers, a pair of undecorated pieces, nothing too flashy or eye-catching, for a good reason no doubt. Anything that would stop her being identified when she would have them out was a damn good thing in her main trade. She slips one into a special compartment on her boot, and one in another pocket at the back of her dress, the opening obscured by her lavish belt. Both remained expertly hidden for now, but a firm pat down of her back would surely find the blade. Fiona silently moves to the door and opens it, curious of the shouting, but the crack of thunder that almost covers the smack stole her attention fully.

I don't know if you're a praying man, but I'd be asking for forgiveness from your gods after tonight, for being involved with that thing.\u201d She follows the man as she continues to speak. \u201cIf it wasn't for me, you would have likely died too, then the rest of the town, and I guarantee you, the dead would include more than panty raiders like that poor bastard.\u201d \u201cSecond,\u201d she continues. \u201cYou would never be able to arrest me by yourself, even if I did let Mouse out.\u201d She holds up a hand to stop him speaking with that new information. \u201cNo, shut up, I'm talking now and you're going to listen.

First, inform your superiors that they need to shut this thing down. Coming from the woods, what, do you think I'm stupid?\u201d She asks as she jabs him with a finger \u201cNo, this is some serious shit that should never have happened. Keep to catapults and wooden war machines, no more eldrich abominations. This never happened, and it never will happen, understand?\u201d It should be noted that her knife is now clutched in her hand and she is very close. \u201cStudy it, then kill it and never make another one. Same with the other one you captured. I think that's a fine compromise.\u201d \u201cNext, you never saw me, and Mouse died at the bandit attack. He's dead and was burned or buried with the other bodies.\u201d Well that wasn't true at all! \u201cNever to be heard from again. If he was alive, I'd find him and make sure he never speaks of this, theoretically of course,\u201d she adds with a shrug. \u201cHe may not have been of much use, but he still tried to help, and I will commend him with that. Plus I made a promise to the man, and I'm the honest sort\u2026 at times.\u201d \u201cNow, are those terms accepted?\u201d She says. \u201cNever to have those creatures again, and for myself and Mouse to never be harassed about tonight? If so, we can let this rest. If not\u2026\u201d her voice is low, but authoritative as she steps back, hand up and her fingers wiggling. \u201cI have my fingers in all sorts of pies in Isra, among the people and the bourgois. I'll tell anyone who will listen, and I'm certain someone will believe. Ever seen wildfire through a forest? Have fun putting it out. Or I'll just kill you now, then the creature, then the other one you captured, even if it takes a thousand cuts. That option sounds much easier to guarantee what I want, but I'm feeling nice.\u201d Her knife was still easy to notice, so close to him, as if she was proving her point. \u201cYou seem smart enough. Take the right choice.\u201d \u201cAnd finally.\u201d One of her eyebrows raise. \u201cAsking a hooded woman with a scarf over her face to hide her identity what her name is? That's just silly. Make up a name if your superiors ask. The Thief of Isra, the Hooded Woman, a crazy bitch who said she was the rightful empress, I don't care.\u201d \u201cNow, are we clear, big man?\u201d She asks, knife still held close. \u201cI hate to threaten you, but this is bigger than either of us, and lets just say I have loose morals when it comes to getting the greater good done.\u201d Such passion and authority in a woman so much shorter than he.

Her sword sang as she unsheathed it. \"I do not fear you,\" she began, placing the blade gently on the back of his neck. \"But I do fear where this journey may take you.\"It rose, then swept through the air, breaking apart the ropes that kept him bound.\"Keeping you apprehended will not cure your rage. Perhaps you will find something that will.\"The sword went to rest in its scabbard. The warrior started toward the door. \"Try to stay out of the village people's business in the meantime, yeah? You're a real handful.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Kasimir folded her arms, gazing at the man with an expression very unlike her; brows knitted, hand to her mouth, eyes reflecting the many thoughts going through her head.

Then she told him her story.He let out a sigh when she finished talking about her father, \"I was right. Products of a cruel fate.\" He said softly looking down and away from her. \"It's all I can think about, everytime I close my eyes, it's all I see over and over and over again. The sword through his chest and then the next minute the blade struck me. I thought I was dead. I remember waking up next to my father, the warm blood pouring out of my face. I tried to wake him but he was gone. I took the signet ring and ran, and kept running. I ended up running for days.\" He bit his lip and looked down against pain flashed in his eyes his eyes would water up. \"Then the bastard puts a bounty on my head months later. Must have thought I was dead. Until I showed up and stole a shipment from him. He runs slaves, drugs, and other things. All for the pursuit of more money. That's all it was. Money.\" He shook his head and looked away.He wouldn't even look up as she walked around him, nor when she pulled her blade. The cold steel place against his neck, it almost felt like a reprieve. He sighed waiting for death to come but yet... The sound of the bindings being cut said death will have to wait \"You.. Are freeing me?..\" he stood up slowly rubbing his elbows \"Why?\" He looked\u00a0down \"Perhaps.. You are right. There are other ways. Stealing his stuff is marginally more fun... And profitable. I sell the really products the were disguising his illegal products at a cheaper price to people that need it. Conveniently most of the guards he hires have bounties so it's so been easy.\"\u00a0\u00a0He would reach out and place a hand on her shoulder, \"Stay. Please. Maybe.. Maybe you can help. You are like the second person I've ever told about this.. and well.. You know this pain\" He did smile and turn her slightly \"And I did pay for the night you know. We can drink and make better memories. Never did finish my bath anyways.\" He laughed and went to his bag, he reach into a hidden compartment and pulled out a bigger bag of coin \"Here. For missing out on your bounty.\"\u00a0 He tossed it at her \"I actually do like your company Sibylle\" he would plop on the bed, \"Besides we already see each other naked. Might as well get to know each other.\" He laughed and pulled out an unopen bottle of wine. \"Come now don't be getting shy nooow.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Lucan's eye met hers as she went through things her mind, his own eye reflected the horrors of the past.

Opening it briefly, she made a swift consensus of its contents and raised a brow. Not a bad amount, however-The coin bag was thrown back at Lucan. \"I am not a real whore,\" she fussed. \"And though that is my name, I don't go by Sibylle anymore. You will call me Kasimir.\" Her arms crossed as she leaned on one leg. \"And you're going to tell me exactly what makes you think I'm entitled to my time.

On the bed Lucan sprawled, \"Have it your way Kas.\" He waved his hand nonchalant as he didn't even look towards her from starting at the ceiling \"You are clever. What do you think I want from you hmm? Hunting is best done in pairs, back to back. We both know this.\" He said taking a swig of the rum and holding the bottle out for her to drink out of. \"No worries love. No drugs.\" He teased \"You are the only one that successfully caught me. Many have tried but all but you failed. That means alot.\" He put up both hands to imitate a lazy shrug \"That's something in my book and from a business stand point we could do a world of good!\" He sniffed and gulped more rum, it's effects becoming apparent\" \".... Or bad.\" He paused and took a breath \" Or both! Probably both.\" He put up a finger \"Besides you think I get as far as I have if I was just some goon?\" He sat up and smiled, \"How about a test eh? There's a group of bandits nearby causing a bit of trouble for the locals, that's why I came here.\" He reached into his back and pulled out a leather bound book filled with different wanted posters from over the years, one opened it showed the faces, the date of death or capture and the coin paid. Some of these were even high value targets. Some were solo, some with a group, last few was with a person with the initial T but until recently the Ts stopped and he was solo. The last few pages had the next targets. Surprisingly his handwriting was immaculate for a drunkard, as if he took his time with his records. \"There is 4 total, Braxton the Mange, Fleck, Briss, Keyn. Braxton is the leader, used to be a butcher or something, I guess it didn't pay enough. He went from butchering to thievry to murder. The rest kinda flocked to him like flys on shit.\" He nods to the book \"A test run.
