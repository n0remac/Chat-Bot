Though somewhat dusty and in desperate need of renovation, the young medicine woman that has bought the house works diligently to make it a place anyone can call home.The cottage has three bedrooms, which one would find surprising despite its small size. In fact, the interior seems conveniently larger than one would expect, both with a comfortably large kitchen and a living room, not to mention an entirely different one used just for weaving, which is upstairs, closest to the medicine woman's bedroom.As the property belongs to a cautious witch with many talents, it has quite a few enchantments and defenses strewn around. Those that have been finished include:Salt TrapThose with any ill will in their hearts of the residents of the cottage are forcefully willed to count every grain of salt that the witch has set down in a large circle around the property, enchanted to stay dry and stay put should any wind or rain bother it.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/uteXw2Z.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><font size=\"5\"><b><i>The Little Whittle Cottage</i></b></font></div>"}, "post-79287": {"user": "Amairgen Llyr", "user_num": 2745, "timestamp": "1517717630000", "message": "A soft whistle emanated from the forest, barely perceptible\u00a0over the sound of the whistling birds tweeting in reply to the song.

There was nothing there, just a wall, which was in the very least perplexing.Swiftly, the witch fished something out from beneath her dress, hanging from her neck by a thin twine: a large, heavy key. Without further hesitation, she jammed it into the wall, right into a keyway that was not there before. She soon pulled open a massive wooden door that most definitely had not existed until the moment she opened it, but Amairgen would find his eyes unable to decipher the change between it having been a wall, then becoming a door. To many, such a sight was upsetting, but they had little time to take that into account.Inside, there was a moderately sized room with a sturdy oak table in the middle, with countless shelves filled to the brim with herbs, fluids, tools, books, and other, more unfamiliar items.\"Put him on the table!\" she instructed him. \"Face-down, his forehead on a cloth-\" She searched briefly for a few pieces of frock to keep the man's head steady and elevated just enough that he could breathe. As Amairgen set Montag on the table, Eira tied her hair back and closed the door behind them, as to bar both Keph and the bratty young girl outside. She needed to work without distraction.

With a final cry, the rodent lifted its arms up and blinded them with a bright shock.It would take a moment for their eyes to see things once more. In fact, the sound of wind- or was it waves? A heavy rushing. That was the first thing they experienced.Then the smell of salt.Alas, as the brightness seeped away from their eyes, skies bathed in a white sun greeted them, beaming down onto a pink cliff made of many twining, rocky arms. Brittle shelves rose up alongside it, decorated with feathery flowers that retreated when a school of fish floated through.Eira grinned and moved forward, through the portal in front of them.\u201cWelcome to the Floodless Realm, Keph. Watch your step and keep your eyes peeled.\u201dOver the cliff, a coral reef, full to the brim with strange anemone, shrimp, gobies, trout, eels, and anything else Keph could have even dreamed of being on the ocean floor, was there, swimming in the air as they would in the water.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Eira gave him a tight, but patient smile. \"Very well then,\" she began, rising from her chair.

He knelt down with Eira, hands being held out towards hers, but staying just far away that they did not touch.\u00a0A nod was given in understanding. Motions were copied one-for-one. A breath was taken, his eyes closed, his lips mouthing the words, unable to truly utter them. He found himself lagging a bit behind, having to imitate the chanting after it had already been spoken. A soft electrical hum began to emanate from young Keph, oddly complementing the sparks that flew from the ritual circle and its high pitched whine.His breathing slowed down, pulse soon following, hum growing, his mind felt completely clear, his surroundings vanishing. He would not notice a thing. Only when Eira finally spoke, did the stimuli from their new environment hit him all at once, a sudden flood a realisation that caused him to fall back in surprise. His back landed on ground, his head feeling nothing but air behind it as it held itself over the cliff edge.\u00a0Carefully, he got back on his feet and took a few steps back from the edge.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Keph returned the uncomfortable smile.\u00a0"}, "post-94984": {"user": "Eira Whittle", "user_num": 2780, "timestamp": "1580404127000", "message": "The witch lashed her head back in a laugh as Keph wiggled away from the cliffside.

Or would you like a hand?\" She offered one, though her pinky and ring finger were still closed partially into her palm.Should he take it, he would find a curious item pressed into his hand. It was a small, iron cylinder decorated in swirling runes that came to a sharp point on one end, split in the middle. There was a chance that Keph had seen such a thing used by nobles, though they were rare. It did bear resemblance to the head of a quill, and even then it was so small!Should he not, she would turn and tell him to \"Catch!\" before tossing it lightly at him. She would also then hand him a small brown pouch that felt grainy and soft. Thirdly, she would hand him an egg. It was hollowed out, and there was a thin rune carved in its face that had wings at its sides.\"Only use that in emergencies. If you find yourself in a bad spot, think the word \"Kozoul\" and crush it. We likely won't need it, but you never know.\" She gave him a wink and was on her way, balancing along a path that rimmed the open water- what was perhaps just called open air here.\"We're looking for an entire large school of octopus. Keep your eyes peeled,\" began Eira as she hopped over a bulbous spot of anemone in the path. She took a sharp left away from the open waters, down a narrow, steep dip into the coral reef. Reflective eyes were plentiful between the rocks and stony wildlife. If Keph followed, a school of flat, silvery-blue fish would swim out and search him, swimming through his hair and clothes in search of little parasites. Further along, Eira would flatten herself against one side of the path, pointing at a cleverly hidden moray on the other side. \"Duck low. They're nasty!\"Eventually, they came to the end of the winding path, finding themselves onto a sandbank beside the sprawling community below the cliff from earlier. It was a colorful sight, a moving kaleidoscope of life without the filter of the great blue to dampen it.It was a good distraction for the gigantic shadow that slipped over Keph, then slid away. If he were to look up, he would see a stray tentacle just dipping behind the reef overhead.

What followed was furious scribbling, a lengthy, frustrated rant thrust from mind onto paper. As he wrote, he only got angrier, leading to crossed out words, replaced by words made of larger, bolder, inelegant letters. Among them there were no doubt words Eira would be unfamiliar with, either made up to sound as nasty as possible, or a part of Keph's little known mother tongue. By the end, the page(s) was (were) a barely legible mess, words strung together by emotion instead of clear thought, with any phrase containing runes smaller than his thumb being totally crossed out. As complicated as his thoughts might've seemed, they could've easily be summarised with: \"Keph almost fell to his death! Why is she laughing at him?\"Despite having taken the item, it took him quite a while to actually notice it in his hand, anger having shrouded it well. He knew something had been making the writing uncomfortable. He squinted his eyes and played around with it. Soon enough, he had found out that it actually had a cap, with an arrowhead-shaped metallic tip hidden beneath it. What was this? While the egg and bag followed, the initial item would keep his focus in tow.He followed the witch about, feet knowing what to do despite his eyes being elsewhere. Yes. Yes. Keep peeled for octopuses. They're weird, flying, tentacular beings -- how hard could they really be to spot? This was the excuse he gave himself so he could keep studying the item. Was that ink? Ink was coming out of the tip. He shook it near his ear. It definitely sounded like there was ink inside. Suddenly, an image flashed in mind. Hadn't he seen the Empress using one of these? Yes. He definitely had. This would've made his long rant a lot easier. Inexplicably, his inability to notice the gift before he went on his tirade only made him madder at Eira. His lips attempt to mouth a series of expletives, making out what they were would be impossible, his inexperience with speaking making the motions themselves mostly incomprehensible. But all that mattered is he knew what he was saying, as did Rara -- and Rara agreed. Or as close as an utterly alien being could come to the concept of agreement. Still, it made him feel a bit better.He smirked. His Patron's reply was angry, violent, expected of something that consumed all. Of course, like always, he'd tone it down to some that would be a lot more reasonable for a human. This had always been crucial for his mental well being and it made it feel as if his companion actually understood him. Whether it did or did not, if it cared or didn't care, or if it merely lacked mortal subtlety would always be in a question kept up in the air, but Keph knew which answer he liked best and that's the one he always took.Instinctively, Keph would duck when told to do so. His hand reaching for his bow, but not yet taking it off his back. He didn't bother warning the witch, he was certain he could go about this himself, and if he could not, she'd at least probably die of laughter.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Keph took the hand, but Leviathan's glory, he was not happy with the witch.
