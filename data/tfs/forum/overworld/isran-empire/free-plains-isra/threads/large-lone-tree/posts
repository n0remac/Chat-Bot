As the feeling ended, he would be left with a nugget of knowledge.Where before it hadn\u2019t been, now the knowledge of a spell to lower the air temperature would be left in his mind. Although it had no name, he now knew how to cast it, how much mana to use, the right feeling for casting it. Still, he would have to practice it much to perfect it, for knowledge of a spell could only do so much.\u201cGo ahead, practice casting it.
