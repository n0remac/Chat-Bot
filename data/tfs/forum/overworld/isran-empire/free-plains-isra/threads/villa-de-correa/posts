Enchanted beings also intrigue me.\" Her eyes darted over to them briefly, then returned to the great hall before them, carved from marble by expert geomancers and lit with spherical gems. The ceiling was so high it sat five times their height. The Correa flag hung down from it along with several others, lining the hallway.They came to the dining room, which was an airy space made of the same marble but carpeted in sapphire hues. A long oak table sat in the middle, eight seats on either side and one on each end. The one closest to the fireplace, a tall and ornate structure painted with dark colors to contrast the room, was carved to depict a pack of dogs rising to the top of a rock that held a sword.

Fortunately he was disciplined enough not to ooh and ahh] out loud.  But the hall was quite a spectacle; he had traveled far and wide and seen many a great hall, but never one with the spherical gems.  The dining room similarly impressive, and Ralf took a seat near to wherever his friend, Ianatan, found one.  He removed his ancestral sword and Hirhanic shield, placing them at his side so that they leaned against his chair.  His battle axe was laid on the other side.  Mariah's dagger was still firmly sheathed in its spot across his chest.\"Aye,\" he answered the vampiress, \"wine'll be lovely!  I fancy Gauldish wine myself, though it's been hard to come by as of late.  If you have any Isran product, I'll take that.\"  Ralf was all too familiar with Vessian drink, what with Asgeir being to its north.  Gauldish wine was one of his favorites, but when it was unavailable he preferred the Isran equivalent.  But none of them compared to Vorutan vodka!Ralf considered Maribel's earlier communications.  Perhaps the vampires classified the White Wolf as an 'enchanted being', but he would not have considered this himself.  He assumed that Ianatan was the one they would be most interested in.  As for Ralf's personal items - his ancestral sword could theoretically channel great powers, but he was oblivious to this ability.  His Hirhanic shield, on the other hand, was very much an enchanted atifact.  He started to question whether the Correa family wanted it.In an effort to turn their ambitions against Ianatan and the Hirhanic shield, Ralf extended an offer of assistance that he hoped Maribel and Vasco would see as more beneficial.  \"I've hunted a monster or two in my day,\" he began.  \"Collected rare ingredients, even items, from their corpse.  I've stumbled upon wondrous caches of enchanted arms and armor.\"  Though these things would normally be a boast, the White Wolf was not liar - he was a seasoned and experienced adventurer.  \"And so, if it pleases you...
