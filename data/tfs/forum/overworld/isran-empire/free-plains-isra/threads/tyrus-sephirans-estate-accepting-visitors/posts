His first order of business would be to get a new change of clothes as his current set was sweaty and not suitable attire for the guests he planned to entertain this evening. He is greeted by his maids and tells them to prepare for guests, dinner must be prepared, the place must be clean. The servant staff all rush off to make sure the evening would not be spoiled by anything. He finally reaches doors to his chamber and throws them open, he immediately strips down and lays on the bed for a few moments. Tyrus only took up a third of the space of his bed, one side of it was always neater than the other because he only sleeps on the left side of the bed. He rarely shared this bed, only a few times with one of the more beautiful maids or a woman of nobility who fancied him, obviously though those nights of passion have resulted in nothing meaningful to him as he is still a bachelor. He turns in his bed and sees a grey hair in front of his eye.\"How annoying, I'm becoming old...\" He carefully pulls the grey hair out by the root and tosses it away. It was time to get dressed, he got up and walked into his wardrobe. After a few minutes he had an outfit picked out and get into it. He then took time to groom his blonde hair, he pulls the back into a ponytail then turns it into a knot, tying it with a blue ribbon. He spent plenty of time preening and making sure everything looked right. He still had time before his expected guests would arrive. With time to kill, Tyrus takes a look at his desk, work from the previous night... \"Pshh, I can do that later.\" Tyrus pulls out a book from one of his shelves and begins to read, he was glad that his eyes still worked perfectly. If he were to begin having trouble reading, he would be filled with woe. He despised each year he gained, knowing he'll eventually become a geezer. These thought were not in his mind now though as he distracted himself in the book. He'd wait for a servant to summmon him.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "After a crazy day at the Assemby, Tyrus returned home to his fine estate.

The events at the Assembly had exhausted him and he craved the comfort of his home now. He slowly walked down the pathway to his estate, looking around at his surroundings and taking it all in. Since he no longer had his career he had enough free time that he could move as slowly as he wanted, just to kill time.Once he finally reached the foyer of his home he removed his jacket and tossed it on the floor, his maid would pick it up later. He walks to the stairs and takes a seat on the 4th step, leaning back and staring at the ceiling. While laying at the stairs groaning he heard the click-clack of his maid's footsteps, he made no movement and continued his low groan.\"Master Sephiran? What's the matter? I thought you'd be out until the late evening, did something not go right?\" The maid asked.\"It was a short meeting. At the end I was removed from my position as Prime Minister...\"\"No! Why?\"\"Some bullshit... fucking Governor Greyiron made the assembly turn on me, accusing me of this and that. I'm very exasperated Remilia.\" Tyrus explained the situation to his servant. He hated Ryden's guts right now, he had kept his cool while at the citadel, but now that he was home it was apparent that he was beginning to enter depression. \"There are documents I need sent to the citadel... whoever takes my spot will need them. *groan* I guess I need to get up to specify which ones... Remilia I want something light for dinner, I don't think I'll have much of an appetite.\"Tyrus would get up from the steps and go upstairs to his office. He would sort out all the papers that belonged to the government and bind them with string. He would have them sent to the Citadel in the morning in time for the emergency meeting. Once finished with that final business, Tyrus would have his dinner in his bedroom, sitting in a comfortable lounge chair occasionally grabbing the plate to have a bite to eat. Eventually he would get up and open one of his secret compartments a pull out a sack. Inside the sack were some magical artifacts that were acquired from a man 4 years ago. He took one of them out of the sack and examined it carefully in the light. He didn't want to mess around with it, just have a look at it. He admired the craftwork put into the orb and placed it gingerly back into the sack and into the compartment again.
