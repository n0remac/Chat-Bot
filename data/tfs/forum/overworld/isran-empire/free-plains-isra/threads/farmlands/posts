Just as he finished his incantation, he opened his maw once again. At first it would seem like he was roaring, but unlike a typical roar it would last much longer than normal... and it would be accompanied by a devastating stream of sub-zero wind. Fundor would feel a cacophony of crackling and squeaking over his very skin as the red hot armor started to cool rapidly. Of course both the environment and his spell were still in play, so their heat naturally countered the intense cold of his attack... which is exactly what Asaph wanted.The opposing force of Asaph breath would push against him, which would once again widen the radius of his orbital flight path, also part of the plan. As Asaph moved further and further away the rock armor would continue to contract and expand, micro-fractures forming at an increasingly rapid pace to absorb the energy from the stone's constant expanding and contracting. Asaph made sure he didn't lose any speed as he did this. And once he was far out enough, that's when he'd made his move.He would come in from behind. Thanks to his ice breath, steam clouds would billow out of from Fondor's armor, blinding the hapless giant mass so that he wouldn't be able to see or respond to what was coming. Asaph would make one more pass at hypersonic speed and then swing into position before charging in, his aura from before also still in play. The distance he had gained from his own ice breath pushing against him had helped move him just the right distance away to execute this maneuver.With a deafening roar Asaph's faint aura would suddenly erupt into a flaming torrent of psionic energy which surrounded him like a blazing purple phoenix. He'd slam the aura into Fundor's back with the force of a sizeable bomb, angling slightly to strike the side of the spine where Fondor's damaged wing was.

With the Nokari mountains as a backdrop, the verdant fields were quite beautiful to her, and despite her current condition, she still enjoyed the scenery as she moved along.\u00a0Indeed, Arya was quite travel weary at the moment, having departed her home and her first master months ago, she meant to travel the wide and expansive overworld, using her talents to help any that were in need. As she walked along on the earth with her bare feet however, she felt quite weak. She had not had something to eat for quite a while now, and even though she had already used her holy magics to heal some farmers near the border of farmlands, she denied their rewards for her... she could not take anything from those people, they were in need more than she. Arya did not have any sort of currency on her at the moment either, for this very reason. She would not accept any payments for her services... Perhaps this was a bit foolish on her part, for if she starved to death, how could she help any more people?Groaning, she moved to rest on the side of the road for a moment. This countryside seemed quite peaceful at the moment, with no other signs of people around the secluded dirt road except for a small farm house that stood nearby. No doubt, the farmers had taken shelter for the time being, with the noon sun blistering down on the fields. Thankfully, her cloak protected her from the heat of the sun, or else Arya knew she would probably be much more dehydrated than she currently already was. Closing her eyes, she laid down on a soft patch of grass for a moment, maybe if she rested she could have enough energy to continue on...Just then, she heard it, the flap of wings. How big those wings sounded is what worried Arya however, as it sounded way too big to be any bird. Somewhat startled she sat up, opening her previously closed ruby eyes just in time to see it swoop over her, heading straight to the farm house, a wyvern.The dark beast seemed to have swooped in from nowhere, and Arya was instantly filled with dread at what she saw next. Two children, a boy and a girl, perhaps brother and sister seemed to round around the corner of the farmhouse at the worst time possible, and the Wyvern roared as he spotted his potential prey, and angled towards the farmhouse now, where the children stood frozen in fear for a moment before they beat a hasty retreat, but it was clearly to slow of a retreat.\u00a0\"Oh no no no NO!\" Arya got up, unsheathing her golden sword as she did, she couldn't get there in time, she had to catch the attention of the Wyvern somehow. With Arya's sword now glowing with holy energy, the golden blade gleaming with power, she swung it, slicing through the air in front of her and sending an arc of light magic at the wyvern's eyes, the attack was not very strong, as Arya did not have very effective long range spells but it blinded the beast and gave the children just enough time to run inside.\u00a0Growling viciously, the beast twisted away from the house, swooping down and landing near Arya, whom it perceived as another easy prey. Arya narrowed her eyes, glaring at the beast, it obviously was not capable of reasoning as it was a wild animal, but she still hoped she could perhaps scare it away...\u00a0Closing her eyes, she began to channel her holy magic, and the sword, which she held upright in front of her body, flat of the blade exposed, seemed to glow even brighter, blinding the wyvern. The moment the beast made it's move, Arya's eyes flew open, now glowing with the holy energy that flowed through her. The giant beast snapped it's giant maw at where she once stood, but she had already moved, darting below the beast's legs as nimble as a deer on her bare feet as she slashed viciously with her holy energy imbued sword across it's underbelly. She was just able to slip out from underneath the beast before it slammed itself into the ground in an attempt to squash her.\u00a0Now positioned just outside it's back left leg, she was in a somewhat safe position as long as she stayed close, out of reach of it's maw and tail. This was only in theory however, and Arya had to retreat as the creature seemed to be much faster than she had anticipated for an lizard that was over 40 ft long. Narrowing her eyes, she readied her sword again, holding it above her head with both arms in what would seem like a roof guard, but as she was getting ready to slash downwards and send an arc of holy magic at the beast, hoping to calm it, she heard it, a second set of wings were flapping in the air above her.\u00a0Arya did not have time to react to the unexpected extra combatant, another wyvern of equal size that swooped down from the clouds to help it's partner in crime. Arya was slammed from behind by the tail of the beast that it lashed out at her, catching her full in the back. She went airborne for twenty feet, before landing in a heap on the ground, just outside the front door of the farm house. Her enchantments on her armor had protected her somewhat, but she still sustained some injuries from the powerful blow.She had even lost grip of her sword at some point, and lay completely disoriented for a few long moments. Seeing stars, she fought her way to her hands and knees at least, her vision spinning as she saw the two wyverns closing in on her. She had been bruised pretty badly, perhaps even broken something as her midsection blazed in pain. Her weakened state from not eating in so long had also not helped in this situation. Despite her current predicament, which seemed like certain death, she turned towards the farm house behind her, where the family within could be seen peering out of the windows nervously. A man, perhaps the father of the children moved to the door, opening it as if he meant to help Arya.\u00a0Falling back to the ground in pain when she tried to stand she screamed, \"N-no!

These images and feelings were not forced upon Lum'valia however, instead they were simply there, completely out in the open if she wished to look through them. If she did perhaps opt to do this she would see Arya's relatively short life flash before her eyes, almost as if it were her own. She would see a childhood filled with happiness for the most part, a small quaint and snowy village set upon a mountain top. Only one person seemed to be in Arya\u2019s life than, a wiry man, with calloused hands, he seemed to work in the mines near the village. Everyday he would come home, at the same time just as the sun dipped below the mountains and cast a orange light upon the white snow. He would always smell of coal dust, and earth. That smell was what Arya recognized him by\u2026 Her mother was never in her life, her father had told her she died in childbirth when she was eight years old. Despite never meeting her mother, Arya cried for days on end. She had hoped one day she could meet her mother.Her father and her other close family and friends in the village made things easier however, and many fond memories zipped past of these times. These memories all seemed to come to a burning halt however, as they reached the point where Arya\u2019s whole life was changed for the worse.Mountains shook and rumbled, liquid fire flowed like rivers as the mountain\u2019s firey breath blacked out the sky. Arya had seen all those she loved burned to death, swept away as they burned. The white snows of her innocent childhood had all but melted away along with all those she knew. Lum\u2019valia would notice the next few yers of her memory after this point are only darkness, no more white snow, no more fond memories, only confusion and sorrow. In these years Arya had been completely lost until she found the order of paladins that took her in and trained her. Images of training would flash by, Arya was completely consumed with her training, every other aspect of her life shut out, and forgotten. Lum\u2019valia would see a golden sword being forged\u2026 it\u2019s very metal imbued with energy the very first time Arya touched it, the powerful link between blade and wielder forming one.Then she would see the first steps of Arya\u2019s journey, there were very few goodbyes, she had only known one person, her master. Every other person seemed distant, shrouded behind a cloud of black smoke of fear of loss. Then... Lum'valia would see Arya here today once again.At this point Arya seemed quite tired, exhausted from the play of events, and the ever calling urge to enter the celestial plane she fought to resist. Her eyes were wide with fear, and tears were streaming down her face now. Just as Lum'valia had lived her memories so too did Arya have to relive them.

They jump on the teeter-totter, each using the force of the other's landing to propel themselves higher and higher into the air.

A rather nervous-looking clown rolls a large wooden sphere into the center of the Seven. It's painted with a large red bulls-eye on one side. The clown gives the ball a spin, sending into a blur of motion, and runs from the circle. As soon as he's clear, the Seven throw their knives, almost at the same time. When the ball stops, the audience would see that all seven knives were in the center of the bulls-eye. After the opening stunt, the Seven began a series of tricks where they juggled blades, flung them into flying targets, and did a series of acrobatics while dodging said blades. At the climax of their act, they positioned themselves in a circle, some twenty feet apart from each other. At the count of three from the ringleader, they each threw a knife at the head of the one to their right. A split second later, they all spun around to catch the incoming knife in their teeth. As the crowd gasped then cheered, the Katashiman Seven vanished with another bang and cloud of smoke. The ringleader was left alone, in the middle of the ring.\"THANK YOU, THANK YOU!
