Approximately three hundred by\u00a0three hundred feet, it towers 2500 feet into the sky, making it an imposing structure that can been seen from miles away. Around the base of the tower lies a rather sizable compound. A square wall surrounds this compound that is about two thousand feet in length and width. Around this wall lies a moat, filled with water, the only bridge over this moat being at the main gate.Inside this wall and surrounding the tower lie numerous three story buildings, mostly inhabited by the towers guards, dwarven builders, and a significant amount of mages whose magic power certain functions of the compound. There are also a few warehouses that distribute food for those living in the compound.The outer wall surrounding the compound and tower is twenty feet tall and has guards posted all along it. It also features guard towers that are seventy five feet tall at regular intervals along it. These towers sit on the inside of the wall and have one entrance at the ground level and one at the entrance to the tower walkway. There are also a number of ballista, catapults, and rather strange looking contraptions with glowing orbs in them placed along the wall. The tower itself is made of a dense black stone that almost seems to absorb the light around it, giving it an odd impression of darkening the area without actually doing so. A number of strange lines run through the stone on the outside of the tower, creating a multitude of complex runes, all woven into a series of recessed alcoves which harbor odd black crystals that fail to reflect any light. It should be noted if one were to fly over the tower, they would notice some strange structures on top. At the base of the tower are two large doors made from steel. The doors also feature strengthening runes on them and are balanced so well that a single man can open them when unlocked.This whole compound lies about two miles from the The Free City\u2019s walls, tower easily within sight range. Although originally built by Grandma, after her mysterious departure, the Black Tower was passed into the capable hands of Lord Tristian Seryl   , formerly of Medan. Much like his predecessor, he keeps the nature of the Black Tower and its activities a secret from the general public.", "link_list": ["/user/1222"], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/uNxgTvb.jpg"], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><img alt=\" \" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/uNxgTvb.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/></div>"}, "post-18478": {"user": "Inspector Zurt", "user_num": 915, "timestamp": "1449850509000", "message": "Inspector Zurt moved down the path towards the Black Tower swiftly. His multiple tentacles causing him to almost glide across the ground. Upon reaching the outer gate, he simply gave one look to the guard at it, before the man quickly unbolted the smaller entrance door located in the wall.Although he had to compress himself slightly, Zurt managed to fit through the door without much trouble. He continued on towards the tower itself, guards giving uneasy looks towards him as he continued on his way. Despite the looks, none dared try and stop him, for they had clearly received the info that he would now be running the day to day at this place.He had been recently awoken for the purpose of running the defenses and logistics of this compound. He would be spending most of his days here from now on, a prospect that didn\u2019t particularly look forward to. Fortunately he could take solace in the fact that he had insured he would be allowed to travel on missions from here. Without that allowance in his contract, he probably wouldn\u2019t have accepted the job in the first place. Reaching the entrance to the tower itself finally, he entered it, doors already open as dwarves continued to make their way in and out of the tower. They appeared to not be done with the construction of whatever was being made under the tower. Unlike the guards, the dwarves eyed him with the look one would give to a masterpiece of art, nodding appreciatively. Zurt found this amusing, although slightly annoying for reasons he couldn\u2019t quite place.The first area in the Black Tower was an entrance hall of sorts. There were a number of desk with clerks at them. It took only a moment for Zurt to locate his office. It was at the end of the main room, a sign with his name and rank on it beside a door of metal, covered in runes. He walked up to the door, holding his spiked hand over it. The gem stone in his hand glowed brightly for a moment and the door clicked open. Making his way into the room, Zurt immediately noticed a man in the corner of the room, tied to the desk with a chain.\u201cI see you\u2019ll be my first assignment\u2026\u201d Zurt gave a rather wide smile, metallic fangs extending.The door behind him closed with a click.

Beside him, a small beetle crested the tip of his carrion-bird cane and rested at the top, just as a climber would atop a mountain's peak. \"I am putting all I have into this.\" He muttered, half to himself, half to the beetle. \"My entire life is in this scroll.\" It was true. The scroll contained every bit of personal information Vikar had regarding himself up to this point. To be fair, it was only his name, age, some paternal details and his brief work history as a merchant's assistant. He had held that job for thirteen years. \"Gods...\" he thought to himself. \"Has it really been that long?\" In addition to his employment history, Vikar had written his skills...or what he believed would pass as skills...down in his sweeping, ornate handwriting. As a merchant, he had learned what made people 'tick'; in a fashion. He was proud of his talent for getting what he wanted, and was how, on this day, he had made the money that afforded the outfit which now adorned him. All save for the cane. The thick black walking tool of oak had been his father's...or what passed for ownership. In truth, his father had won it in a card game from a spry, healthy old leacher named: Sir Blight. Even as a young boy, the irony of the name did not escape him. His father tossed it on the mantle as a decorative item in their Free City home, and never touched it. Vikar had always taken a liking to it, and it seemed to fit his chosen ensemble. With the shake of his head, Vikar stopped himself. \"Look at me, I'm reminiscing.\" He said with a chortle, again to his insect companion. With a flick, he sent the beetle on it's way, and gripped the haft of his cane with his right hand. In a stride that garnered respect and an expression to match, Vikar started toward the Black Tower; a great structure that had loomed over him since he was a boy among the city. When he arrived across the long, quite intimidating bridge, he confidently approached one of the guards standing watch below the looming walls. Without being addressed first, as Vikar preferred to have the lead in any conversation in which he wanted something, he stopped at a reasonable distance in front of the sentinel and said in a low, smooth tone: \"I do not wish to waste your day sir, so I will save the pleasantries for another time. I wish to be escorted inside, as to make my acquaintance to whomever will entertain my arrival.

The would-be spy rested his cane on his lap, and folded his hands. He regarded the scribe with a serious, yet inquisitive look, and began his request. He had rehearsed this several times before entering the building, but the complexity of this request; or rather the threat of squandering it on gilded words, weighed heavily on him. \"A bit of both, I suppose.\" Vikar said, leaning back slightly to convey ease. \"I am going to be honest with you, as I'm sure you'd expect. I have very little combat experience, and frankly my skills with a blade are limited. I cannot use magic, nor do I command an army.\" He stopped for a moment, to let this sink in. \"I do not know much of your organization, apart from what has been outwardly advertised, so forgive me as I do not know what to expect. However, I was hoping to enter into a partnership.\" At this point, Vikar withdrew the scroll from his coat. \"Upon this scroll is my entire life up to this point. I will extend my skills to you, should you require. In payment however, I do not wish to be paid in standard currency.\" He set the scroll down on the edge of the table. Not to a distance to the scribe that would convey hinderance, but rather, to a point where he would have to reach across the table uncomfortably Vikar guessed, should he decide to pick it up. \"I would ask to be paid in information. Access to a store of information that an organization such as yours no doubt contains. This would be to our mutual benefit, as I would be of greater service to you armed with the knowledge of your clandestine organization, and your network would aid me in furthering my own personal gratification. I could not be bought.\"Vikar sat back further, and to cement his point, lifted his cane and pointed it's carrion bird head at the scribe. \"It would be insane for you to trust a complete stranger with your information, I understand. I have a proposition for a contract, and should I fulfill it, the payment would be to honor my agreement. Interested?\" He lowered his cane, and sitting forward conveying interested, he waited for the response.

All that had vanished from sight was not full gone. The being that stood would soon make an example of this. The arrows would strike Hizenn, but they would get stopped on contact with whatever was below the cloak. The arrows stuck in the armor just shy of a quarter inch. The crosses that besieged him at a slow rate were easily sidestepped.Once the volley was over, Hizenn stopped his motion. Nobody was close enough, but below the cloak was the rest of the armor that went with the mask. This armor was slightly noticeable from the rips in the cloak.As for Fizlor's attack, Hizenn found his cover. Hizenn waited for the fire stream to reach a certain point. And then Hizenn started his dash. In a mad dash, Hizenn took off. This fire gave him the few seconds he needed to make his break. Hizenn was running about one hundred yards every ten seconds. With the bright fire striking, it would hide Hizenn's initial leap forward. What Hizenn didn't expect was the dragon that was trying to slam into him. Hizenn made it no more that forty yards before he head the massive slam into the marble. Thankfully the marble was extremely dense and would hurt the dragon. Thanks to the density, the Seismic Waves that normally came with such a slam wouldn't happen. All Hizenn would hear is a loud thud.\"Well that could have ended badly.\" Hizenn chimed as he peaked around for less than a second while running. The cloths on the robes had been singed by the fire, but nothing excessive. Hizenn was hoping that his garments colors would camouflage his form and \u00a0give him an additional second or two to make it a bit further. There wasn't much between him and the edge, maybe fifteen more seconds. It was so close and he was determined to make the leap. Still protected by the Anti-Magic, Hizenn was very likely to succeed in his dash. He then noticed Inaba coming near him, \"Well bring it here! Don't just say something and not do it. I'm about ready to turn it in.\"At Hizenn's sprinting speed, he found the edge of the building in no time. As he feet found the edge, his legs would bend and give him the power he needed to make his leap successful. His body shot off the edge of the building, spreading his arms and legs out. The coat would ripple around him, revealing glints of the armor beneath as he fell.

The immutable structure would view Lum'Valia's consciousness with curiosity. On a fundamental level it did not seem either good or evil. Instead it seemed amused, like a child.The soul willing revealed its secrets. It was a mature soul, many lifetimes old, but not extremely well seasoned. Like most souls its age it sought the mysteries of good and evil, of society and the world and how best to improve it, and also sought to explore the human lust for power. This soul in particular was obsessed with power and social change. It was very brave, able to face Lum'Valia straight on despite her incredible power.Hello.The more Lum'Valia peered into it, the more she would see what this soul had experienced in this lifetime. Its human vessel was gifted, tenacious, charming, strong, many good qualities. And like most humans it had been gifted with sympathy and kindness. But the direction of that kindness was towards those that humanity rejected, criminals, aberrations, those too different to participate in normal society. Over time this had caused the vessel to develop a crusade-like mentality, to break the social order and cause chaos, to shape the world into a place where such aberrations could thrive.Later this had led to the acquisition of disciples, the Budas being the most prominent. These creatures were feared for being superior. They were often born with special talents, and it was believed that they acquired these talents by making pacts with demonic entities. Their ability to transform back and forth from hyenas hardly proved them wrong. His other followers, the Olitiau and Mokelembebe, were nearly hunted to extinction for just being different. Ukufa felt it was his duty to save them.Hey, that tickles.However honorable the soul might seem in some ways, there was definitely a natural evil to be found in its vessel. Ukufa was an undeniable sadist who had learned to kill from an early age. He was truly arrogant, and felt himself above the law. This was true even before Demigrem's soul surgery.Demigrem, now here is where things got interesting. As Lum'Valia explored the alignment aspect of the soul and its vessel, she'd find something very interesting, and disturbing. Parts of the external structure of the soul had been... externally modified. Her reaction might be that of a surgeon who had just discovered that several of his patient's organs had been replaced with black tar. The \"good\" parts of the soul's external structure, and even more so the good parts of the vessel, had been replaced by something almost artificial and alien. Lum'Valia would find the craftsmanship of this soul substance both terrifying and mesmerizing. At the soul's very core, what Lum'Valia would sense was a mixture of wonder, amusement, and respect.He is very powerful. Look!\"GRAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!\" Lum'Valia would be hit with a horrific shock. The artificial soul, Demigrem's soul, would lash out at Lum'Valia, attacking her very consciousness. \"GRAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!\" She would feel it like a horrific thunder and lightning, shocking her senses. The substance would almost feel like it wanted to kill her.But if she persevered, she would still hear the core of Ukufa's soul.He gave me what I needed, to explore evil, power, and change.Lum'Valia would see visions of his twisted society, the village of Purnata, which had been constructed largely thanks to Demigrem. Although it was a horrific place, it was a safe haven for those that Ukufa cared about, the ones no one else would.\"GRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!\" Demigrem's \"additions\" would only grow angrier and more powerful, striking Lum'Valia's mind like a migraine. The core of Ukufa's soul would only grow more delighted.Mommy and daddy need to stop fighting.\"SOFOBGSDNDFKNFDKNDSJKSSDKJKSNDKSJND...\" A cacophony of mutterings and whispers, mostly threats and evil thoughts, would begin to flood Lum'Valia's mind. The entity was even more powerful and ancient than she was, and the sensations would be a demand to surrender. However, the core did not necessarily agree.If you remove him, I will not become your ideal of good. My quest is not complete...Lum'Valia would see visions of Ukufa in the Black Tower, in a new body, more powerful than before. She would see him hunting down people, allying with the most twisted abominations, betraying the Black Tower, leading an army, following his noble but twisted ideology to the bitter end.There is a chance I will follow my own path to darkness.Lum'Valia would also see alternative visions of Ukufa recruiting more of these twisted beings into the Black Tower, becoming a leader among them, protecting those who had no one on this earth even willing to try to understand them, becoming aligned with good, but chaotic to the very extreme.There is also a chance I will find the light.\"GrahahahahHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!\" The evil, alien substance would begin to take an aggressive posture in her mind, like a warrior, but much more twisted. She'd feel the presence taunting her, baiting her to do battle.If you do this, you must accept that my destiny is not fixed.The darkness' presence would increase many times over and feel like it was actually charging Lum'Valia.I must follow my own path. I must learn. You cannot choose it for me.The presence would howl in her mind, shaking the very corners of her consciousness in lightning.If you accept these terms, you have permission to cleanse me.

An enormous rectangular block of gray stone, three meters square on the ends and approximately twenty meters long, with an elongated hexagonal beveled projection on either side, near one end. The stone is covered in channels and runes, some tiny, some huge, and all filled with gold or silver inlay.The device is suspended by huge chains to an octagonal metal ring. At the apexes of the octagon sit blocks of runed stone.She runs through her mental checklist one last time before she gives the signal to begin. Mages take their places, standing on the ring. At a signal, they drop to one knee, and grasp a pair of crystal handles in front of them. One of the mages adjusts something on a panel in front of her, and the blocks of runes begin to glow, faintly, as they draw power from the mages. Technicians scurry around the matrices, double-checking their functionality. The inspection shows no flaws, and the technicians signal this to the ring operator. She responds by pouring more power into the matrices. The ring slowly begins to lift off of the ground, the chains clinking as they grow taut. The runestones are thrumming with power now, an audible basso hum that causes the tools on the benches to vibrate slightly.The monolith clears the ground. The field of magical power shifts slightly, and the whole apparatus begins to move, slowly creeping out of the door. Raiko gazes up, to the top of the tower, so far above them, and briefly questions her sanity in undertaking this venture. Extraneous thoughts such as this are quickly swept aside, however. She had no time for them.She signals the ring operator, who opens the throttle. The runes glow blindingly bright. The humming is earthshaking. The ring ascends, slowly creeping up the side of the Tower.Mages on personally-sized octagonal flying platforms flit around, keeping an eye out for any side of trouble, Raiko among them.Thirty nerve-wracking minutes later, the ring clears the top of the tower. It moves to the center of the tower, where a hexagonal pyramid, twenty meters high at the tip, resides. When the center of mass is above the tip of the pyramid, the monolith lowers. As it contacts the tip, the pyramid's stone begins to soften and flow, filling channels in the underside of the monolith. When the channels are completely filled, the monolith stops lowering. The ring descends slightly below that position, just enough to put slack in the chains. Mages scurry around, checking the connection. When their inspection is finished, a mage channels into some of the runes in the pyramid, and the monolith moves in a complete circle, the ring moving with it. It repeats this motion again, twice, after traversing up and down to its full extent. Finally, the ring is disconnected, and it proceeds back to solid ground.On the top of the tower, work continues non-stop for the next few hours, with mages running tests and confirming a correct installation.

Stan, the carriage driver sits in his seat on the forefront of the carriage, swaying side to side with the natural contours of the road. Raising a hand to cover his mouth, he yawns. Why did this have to be so early? He adjusts the fit of his new uniform absently- a double breasted pea coat. The garment itself is a deep black, with columns of  shining silver buttons stretching down the front, almost like stars. The deep purple logo of The Midnight Sun is emblazoned on his right lapel, providing the moon for the night sky. But the thing is, the shoulders don\u2019t sit quite right.

Stepping up the ladder, he raises the upper half of his body through the opening, and uses a spyglass to gaze ahead at their destination. What an impressive building, he muses. He pans upwards to view the top of the structure through the limited field of view afforded by the skyglass, and notices the newly installed runic matrix sitting atop the structure. As a Midnight Sun Operative, he is privy to the quiet relationships between The Midnight Sun, The Black Tower, and The Red Sisterhood. He thinks back to the approximation of the device\u2019s power related to him during the early morning briefing, and shudders a bit at the sheer power of the thing. After taking a moment to train the spyglass around at the landscape as it rolls past, ensuring that they weren't being followed or observed, he ducks back down into the carriage, locking the hatch behind him and appreciating his choice of allegiance a bit more deeply than before.The carriage continues its journey across the plains up to the gatehouse of the main gate, rolling to a stop before the moat. Quiet codewords are exchanged between the gatehouse guard and Stan. The guard was expecting their approach, and after confirming the identity and status of the carriage, he sends word for the drawbridge to be lowered. With the metallic clanking of the great metal chains across the moat, it is done, the end of the drawbridge coming to rest neatly in its groove in the ground. With a nod and a salute, the gate guard indicates that the carriage is clear to proceed. With a returned salute and a whipping of the reigns, Stan and the great carriage continue across the drawbridge, the reinforced wooden planks creaking as the great steel carriage rolls across. However, the drawbridge holds, and as soon as the carriage is across, it draws back up with another great metallic racket of chains.

Hmm.\u201d Madame Naoki puts a hand to her chin, and begins to think, turning to glance sidelong at Skarlet. There she is, bashfully looking at her feet, with her cute little parasol and red dress, as well as the worst possible problem. As the gears of her mind begin to spin, Naoki finds herself overcome with pity for Skarlet as she begins to think through the problem. To be so young, and to be saddled with such an insurmountable and terrible curse.She begins to empathize, thinking ahead, imagining a hypothetical future in which she is beset by the same curse. The world changing around her in fast-forward. Funerals. Funeral after funeral after funeral, caskets slamming shut on everyone she\u2019s ever known\u2026 Kate, Artemis\u2026 Wait. Artemis. Artemis has the same problem! Oh my god.A sharp intake of breath, Naoki bites her tongue as she turns the other way to look at Artemis. Or, more accurately, the back of Artemis\u2019 head, as she gazes upwards at the tower, likely using her sight to study the rune patterns present on the tower\u2019s surface. Has Artemis ever thought about this? \u2026 She probably has, but hasn\u2019t said anything. \u2026 Why? To spare her the guilt? \u2026No. No, that\u2019s not how Artemis thinks. Artemis hasn\u2019t said anything because she already has the solution. She has the solution a dozen times over, placed in strategic positions on her body. She has the solution in the sole of her shoe. She has the solution in a spring loaded deployment system in her sleeve, she has the solution in the small of her back, and hidden in her brassiere. Artemis is fully capable and willing to terminate the problem when it inevitably arises.Dammit, Skarlet. These are not the sorts of uplifting thoughts I\u2019d like to start my morning with.Naoki swallows, and removes small bit of debris from her eye, attempting to repress this sudden wave of emotion. She again finds herself thankful for the time she spent training to suppress her emotions. It would hardly do for her to start sobbing when asked for advice. With a few deep breaths and some mental calming techniques, the feeling is passed. Passed from the conscious, to that little place in the back of her mind where all of those repressed emotions sit bottled, to better allow her to act in the present, unhindered. Naoki briefly contemplates sharing Artemis\u2019 macabre solution with Skarlet, but decides against it. Skarlet is too young to be considering such things. She\u2019ll come to the same conclusion herself, eventually, Naoki thinks, in an uncharacteristically grim thought.Realizing how long she\u2019s spent in contemplation, Naoki takes another deep breath, nods, and begins.\u201c... Yeah. That\u2019s a problem that you\u2019ve got, isn\u2019t it. I\u2019ll try to offer what advice I can. Keep in mind that I don\u2019t have any personal experience in this sort of thing- only recently having gotten into a serious relationship myself,  and you might consider asking someone who shares your issue, of which I\u2019m sure there are many. \u2026 Though, I would caution you against taking relationship advice from Mr. Ulciscor. I have nothing against him, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s really the right person to ask about this sort of thing.\u201dNaoki turns to face Skarlet, and establishes eye contact as she begins to properly impart her advice.\u201cI apologize, but I\u2019m not going to sugarcoat this for you. It isn\u2019t my nature to make light of large problems. And yours is a very large problem, likely the most large and terrible problem anyone will ever consider or be faced with. Whatever course of action you decide to take, there won\u2019t be an end, and you\u2019ll likely be left highly dissatisfied with your immortality and the world as a whole. Let me say this just once before I begin, and know that I speak with the utmost sincerity when I do. I feel sorry for you. Though I feel bad to ruin your mood in this way, you will, over the course of your lifetime, likely be in for many times more sorrow, guilt, and negative feelings than I will ever experience. And in knowing this, I  genuinely pity you and your immortality, and wouldn\u2019t wish the same upon anyone else. I wish I could do more to help you, or provide a perfect solution, but I don\u2019t believe that one exists. So instead, let that be said, and let me try to give what suggestions and assistance I can.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think that not loving someone is a realistic option. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to completely close yourself off in that way that was recommended to you. Since you\u2019ve already dipped your feet in, and tasted what love is, you\u2019re not going to be able to stop. It\u2019s addictive in that way. You\u2019re going to get lonley eventually. Even if you can break up with Francesco now, you\u2019re going to wish that you hadn\u2019t. You\u2019re going to long for someone to hold you in the same way he has, to look into your eyes with that same passion. You\u2019re going to want someone to hug, someone to miss when they\u2019re not there, someone who will make you feel happy and safe, just by being present\u2026\u201d\u201cHehem.\u201d Naoki clears her throat, and reapplies a touch of professionalism to her tone. \u201cUnless that vampirism has been kind enough to change the very core of your being, your basic nature, first as a human, you\u2019re going to love again. Even if you can get over Francesco now, even if you can detach yourself and live alone for a while, it\u2019s going to come back. In a year, in ten years, in ten hundred years. Eventually, you\u2019re going to get lonely, and want someone. Love isn\u2019t something you can opt out of now that you\u2019re in.\u201d\u201cNo, you\u2019ve got to find a way around your issue. One option, though I\u2019m not sure if it would suit you, would be to live a sort of nomadic love life. Stick with Francesco for a while, a handful of years- ten or twenty or so, and then leave him. Remember him fondly, and find someone new and young to take his place. Continue the cycle indefinitely, and never stick around long enough to see the person age and die. If you decide to do it like that, you\u2019ll be spared some of the negative feelings of being present for their death. However, those feelings might set in later, worse, when you look back, a thousand years from now, and realize that Francesco is dead, and has been for hundreds of years. There will be someone new, yes, but in those in between periods, and when thinking about the past, it\u2019s going to be rough.\u201d\u201cAnother option might be to find or create someone with the same problem, and, in being two of a kind, make it not a problem for either of you. I\u2019m not particularly well versed in how exactly vampirism spreads, but in theory, you could just bite Francesco- or do whatever it is you do, and then he\u2019d be a vampire too, right? Or use some other method to make him immortal. In this magical world of today, I\u2019m sure there are plenty of ways you could go about it, and it wouldn\u2019t really matter which one, as long as he doesn\u2019t die. However you do it, problem solved, Francesco lives forever with you.\u201d\u201cOr at least, problem reduced.  You\u2019d still run into problems down the line when other people die. You can\u2019t really bite everyone that you care about, and maintain the same circle of friends forever. Because then they would all be faced with the same problem you\u2019re currently faced with, where all of the other people that aren\u2019t immortal die. Just as an example, through which I mean to imply nothing, me. I\u2019m going to die. This is a fact, and one that I\u2019m fine with. I wouldn\u2019t like to be immortal. Because if I were, them I\u2019d be faced with your same terrible problem, but with Kate, and essentially everyone else at The Sun; I care about a lot of people. What some might see as the greatest gift, I see as the greatest curse, immortality. I would hate you for it eternally.\u201dShe stops, aware of the words coming out of her mouth. She had far overstepped the realm of polite advice, had allowed her feelings to taint the discussion. \u201cBut my point is that it\u2019s hardly a realistic possibility, to make everyone you care about immortal. Attempting that would just breed a lot of negative emotions and resentment with a much larger group of people. No, if you\u2019re going to need to keep your list of people you care about as short as you can, to spare yourself as much heartache as possible.\u201d\u201cAnd to get around the rest of it, it would probably be best to find somewhere to live that\u2019s secluded, some place out in the country, where you don\u2019t have to watch townsfolk live and die, cities, nations, empires... civilizations rise and fall.\u201d\u201cThe largest issue with that would be that you would probably get very bored very quickly. But what\u2019s a little boredom, relative to the alternative? Not the worst problem to have, if you ask me. Find some books to read, dedicate yourself to the advancement of science, the production or art, or some other noble goal with which to occupy your time. Try to make the best of what you have.\u201dNaoki ends her speech there, on a positive note, but finds her professionalism cracking.

The runes on his arms and legs, were expertly done and showed an advanced understanding of runecraft. The runes on his body though... They were the work of a true master, and a true monster. The runes for increased stamina, are a bit run of the mill, except they cross interestingly with the healing runes. The two sets of runes combine, meaning that he not only heals faster, but also completely. His body does not cease repairing damage, until it is perfect again. Alden will not carry accumulated damage. He will never suffer from aches and pains, from old injuries. Indeed he wouldn't even have any scars, except whoever carved the runes left a deliberate exclusion for Alden's skin.  There are also runes of obfuscation. Designed to throw off magical attempts to detect Alden. These are actually quite cleverly designed. Instead of flat out blocking, attempts the runes deflect them. Someone attempting to find would be able to tell he was there, but they would think he was in an entirely different position.Ultimately those were the obvious runes, the ones that are easy to decipher. Only a true master would be able to decipher, the rest of what is there. Assuming Raik\u014d is capable, she would discover the following. The first and most disturbing is the soul catch. Alden's entire runic system is tapped into two power sources, first is of course his natural mana well. The second is the soul catch, which is exactly what it sounds like. The assassin was literally, and unknowingly carrying the soul of every victim he killed. Those souls are suspended with a purgatory realm, and when his well runs dry the runes draw from it instead. It was actually brilliant, if appallingly evil. Depending on how many people the young man had killed, he could be sitting on nearly infinite power.  The next set of runes, are for power regulation. Without regulation his runes would immediately draw upon all of his mana, for one massive burst of strength, healing, stamina or what have you. The regulating runes prevent this, as well as keeping a constant flow of mana to some runes, while only providing flow to others when it is needed. Interestingly the regulating runes are tied directly to his main well. This means that the amount of strength flowing into his runes, can be affected by his emotional state. In a completely neutral mood, he would heal four times faster than a normal man, and be about two to three times stronger, faster, and more durable. Feeling a single emotion very strongly would provide a small, but noticeable, increase to these number. Though if he were exerting control over his emotional state, it wouldn't be affected. If he were to feel multiple emotions very strongly though, the amount of power feeding into his runes could be increased exponentially.What has been done to Alden is equal part monstrous, and brilliant. His entire body is a magical weapon of the highest order. Not only that, but if his scars are any indication he has skills that would make him deadly regardless. The statement that he is a weapon rings true. ", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"The person who put these on me, was trying to make a weapon.

A small application of mana sticks the parchment firmly to the wall, and she gets to work. The scroll, and an equally massive partner, are both soon filled with diagrams of Alden's runic layout. As she works, Raiko mutters to herself continually. Most of it is arcane technical terminology, interspersed with expressions of incredulity at the ruthlessness of the runescribe, and the occasional off-key verse of a song.Finished with her transcription, she pulls a pair of loose cotton pants and a long-sleeved cotton shirt from the bag, and tosses them to Alden. \"Put these on, I still need to perform some tests.\"A stick of white chalk is procured from the bag, and she sketches a magic circle on the floor. A set of three small runic matrices are placed in the circle in appropriate spots, and she indicates to Alden that he should stand in the middle. She pulls from the bag a leather carrying case. Unrolling it and revealing the contents to be a set of metal pipes, she plucks the first one, a slender thing about the diameter of a finger, from its place, and hands it to Alden. \"Crush this flat, if you are able.\"She jots down notes on the results, and asks him to repeat the process with successively larger and thicker-walled pipes, until she runs out, or he is unable to deform them.Several other tests follow, and reams of parchment are covered with her perfectly-formed writing, before she comes to her last procedure. The toolbag produces a straight-edged stone knife. \"If you'll permit, I'd like to test your healing runes.\"Should he allow it, she makes a small incision approximately an inch long in his left forearm, and observes the healing process.

After a moment of channeling, the doors would swing open silently, giving not so much as a creak as she continued into the room beyond.It was a massive cavern of a room, the ceiling impossible to see in the low light. The room was completely empty, except for a number of objects in its center, all placed there for her task at hand. A recently slain lion laid on the floor, however, its body bore no marks of injury. Around the body of the lion were countless runes, painted on the floor in what appeared to be blood. Although it had taken her long than she thought it would, she was finally prepared to revive Ukufa. Pulling a small silver jar of sorts from her pocket, Grandma would walk to the middle of the inscription, placing it near the lion's body. About ten more of these silver jars were present, but the others were in a circle around the perimeter of the runes. Satisfied everything was in order, Grandma would walk back so she was standing outside the runes, surveying it all one last time before beginning the ritual.The way she planned to perform it was rather inefficient, but for her, mana was of no concern. Still, she could almost hear horrified comments by the numerous necromancers and liches souls she had taken about the waste of power about to be performed here. An amusing thought, but an irrelevant one nonetheless, she should simply get on with the experiment.Shedding her human form, Grandma became one of smoke and shadows as she began channeling into the ritual. The blood runes would begin glowing with a scarlet hue as they were fed power, the various jars with souls in them beginning to become linked to the ritual.

I find that speed comes easier when one is invested in one's work.\"She gestures to her desk, where, in a rare clean spot, there rests a set of armor and two sheathed swords.The armor is a dark gray, crafted with two layers of fine cured leather. The inside of the outer layer has been branded with a standard, if highly effective and optimized, suite of passive armor runes. Durability, magic resistance, physical resistance, water-repelling, and dirt-repelling sequences. Worked into the mix is a sequence suppressing the emitted magical signatures when out of combat. Dwarven-forged metal plates have been placed in critical areas. These plates have been heavily charmed and runed to prevent piercing. They also possess an active portion, enabled at the wearer's discretion, which generates a projectile-deflecting field around the wearer.The armor is nothing out of the ordinary, when it comes to high-end enchanted gear. A significantly lessened mana draw and slightly heightened effects speak of Raiko's prowess, but the effects could have been obtained elsewhere.The swords, however, are pure art.Perfectly-sized for Alden and expertly balanced, the blades are visually rather unremarkable. A straight, double-edged length of polished, razor-sharp silvered steel, with a blood groove down the middle, and the Red Sisterhood, Cult of Storms, and Raiko's personal crests engraved at the base of the blade. Plain, sharply angled guards point towards the blade away from a black leather single-handed grip and hexagonal prism pommel.As soon as one takes hold of the grip, the power of the sword becomes evident. Even the magically-unattuned could sense the energy contained in the steel; the grip almost literally vibrates from the magic. The alloy blade began life in a large sheet. Precise lines of all but microscopic runes were engraved, before the metal was folded and forged again and again. More runes were added in each stage, as the previous lines were absorbed into the metal. The blade created by this process is a masterwork in its own right, with the addition of runic effects permeating every crystal of the metal. The passive sequences range from strengthening, to sharpness and durability, to banishing. The swords, previously identical, differ at this point. One is engraved with symbols to destroy and banish holy/good creatures, the other to harm and banish dark creatures. The one blade was quenched in holy water, the other in virgin's blood.Each is imbued with active effects allowing for the blade to freeze or ignite its victims, and another set to imbue the flame or ice with its good/evil attribute.The end result is a matched set of swords capable of shearing through solid stone without dulling, and piercing dragon's hide like paper. They possess a very significant mana draw when using their active features, or when under heavy abuse, but at rest, they are remarkably efficient.The scabbards are heavily enchanted, both to contain the lethal sharpness of the blades, and to suppress the miniature sun of magical signature each generates even at rest.\"I hope you find them to be to your liking,\" Raiko intones.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Raiko huffs. \"It was an interesting project.

Dead, of natural causes or perhaps by something more malicious. My body, likely entombed beneath the ground in a fancy box. And the world as a whole, it will ultimately\u00a0be\u00a0rather unaffected by my passing. Even though some may remember me, and my actions may leave a less temporary impact on the world than myself, I am but a tiny mote on the face of this world, if perhaps a marginally more impactful mote than some others. I don\u2019t believe there to be any great overarching purpose or meaning to my life, or to lives in general. My existence was brought about by circumstance, though I know not the exact details. What I perceive to be consciousness, in all likelihood, won\u2019t last for very long at all, relative to the grand concepts of the universe or civilization. I don\u2019t believe that I was placed here by any omnipotent power, with any directive or instructions.  There isn\u2019t any objective meaning to my life; I simply am.\u201d\u201cHowever, I am. Here, I am; living, operating, and acting in this world I share with you. It is in this fact, that there is no inherent meaning to the life I live, that I find freedom. I am totally free to exert my will on the world I live in, however I see fit.. I am free in every sense of the word, to do as I wish. I may choose how to live my life, what actions to take to accomplish any goal I might designate for myself. And in this radical freedom, I am free to decide what I want, what meaning I would like my brief stay on this earth to have. I am free to choose what I believe to be right and wrong, I am free to choose my companions, how I treat them, and in what ways I will alter this world. I am free to choose what I give subjective value to, free to choose who I love, and what I do with my life.\u201d\u201cAnd I remember, that I will not be free forever. Eventually, as all do, I will die. And that\u2019s fine. I think that living for too long would get boring anyway. It would almost devalue each moment, as one of a limited number of moments in which I am totally free. And if I were to live forever, what point would there be in living, after all those who I have cared about have died? I have chosen to place a great deal of subjective value into my relationships with others. I have- perhaps through my formative years, or perhaps due to my natural disposition, adopted the habit of enjoying interacting with others, especially those individuals I hold in high regard. I find it endlessly engaging to interact with other beings as nuanced and complex as myself. I cannot hope to truly understand another individual, for I do not even fully understand even myself, but yet, I can try. I think that I have what amounts to a relatively deep, yet not complete understanding of a few. I have a fairly substantial number of close relationships, with my adopted family, co-workers, and associates. I will always find it enjoyable to meet new individuals, and learn about them, their experiences, and how they perceive the world. But I digress- without those individuals I have chosen to invest myself in, the meaning I have given my life would no longer exist. Thus, I would never take the option of immortality, if it was presented to me. No, I prefer life as it is; brief, finite, and without any objective value to it.\u201d\u201cAnd though I hate to use the word, as it sort of disparages all of the work I have put into shaping my life into the rather pleasant state it is, I consider myself fortunate. Fortunate to have happened across so many excellent individuals, fortunate for having been able to befriend them, and share in what we consider \u2018life\u2019 with them. Fortunate for finding such an excellent companion in Artemis, fortunate for happening across an individual- almost entirely by chance whom I am able to love with every ounce of my being. Fortunate to simply exist, and live on this world, at this time.\u201d\u201cSo, I suppose\u2026 to answer your question, there is nothing more enjoyable or more painful that you or I will experience than life itself. All of our experiences, pleasant and otherwise, happen in this narrow little window we call our lives. All I\u2019d like to do is enjoy mine.\u201d\u201cBut, to be more specific, that means, in my case, at this present chapter of my life, essentially improving the state of the lives of others, especially those I care about.\u201d\u201cI have, in my own quest to live comfortably, acquired the means to do essentially whatever I please. I don\u2019t mean for this to come off as bragging, but I am unfathomably rich and influential. I have built up an enormous capability to enact whatever changes I see fit on the lives of those I see fit. Look at this tower, for a moment. You\u2019re a powerful mage, you can surely sense the immense power sitting dormant here. At a single command from my mouth, this facility could reduce the city of Isra to dust, or instantly end the life of any foolish enough to attack it, to speak nothing of the combatants housed within. I have an immense network of powerful and influential individuals who are loyal to me, though coin or trust. They are armies to march on my enemies, or allies to work cooperatively by my guidance. I could, in a single gesture, end your life, or bestow upon you weapons with which you could use to conquer nations. If I was able to liquidate all of my accumulated wealth at market value, (assuming that such a massive amount of gold exists, and the economy doesn\u2019t change at all,) and divide it evenly across Isra, each inhabitant could afford to have their very own castle built.\u201d\u201cI think\u2026 what I truly enjoy is having and using that capability. There is nothing that pleases me more than to see a friend prosper and attain happiness by my hand, or to remove a problem that plagues those I care about. This is why I continue to expand my networks and my influence, it is to expand that capability to do those things. I hope to be remembered by many as the best thing that ever happened to them. To be remembered by at least a few as the being who changed their lives for the better, and allowed them to live at least a portion of their life in happiness.\u201d\u201cI realize that sometimes this means killing. I realize that I have, directly and indirectly, brought death and despair to an awful lot, and that if I continue to operate as I have, this will continue. I cannot begin to grasp at this ever-growing number, and I do feel sorrow for doing so, but not remorse. I have made it this far in life without any major regrets, and will never regret choosing the good that is greater to me. This is because death, despair and all things unpleasant will still continue to exist, and I am powerless to stop them. I can do my best to mitigate them, sure, but as long as there are two humans alive on this world, someone is going to want someone else dead.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve come to learn, that\u2019s a simple fact of human nature, and an awful lot of other species\u2019 nature, too. As so long as human nature remains as it is, humans will want to kill other humans. Even I am not above this flaw. If you were to suddenly interrupt me, and spew hurtful words, insult this very core of my being that I am in the process of disclosing, I would probably want you dead. I can\u2019t help it, and neither can you. If I committed some crime against you or those who you care about, you would probably want me dead, too. All we can do is have restraint. I wouldn\u2019t kill you, no matter what you might have to say, because as a powerful and living mage, you have plenty of applications, willing or not. Likewise, assuming that you\u2019re even mildly sane, you won\u2019t make an attempt on my life because a successful one would mean angering so many of my allies, and would undoubtedly end in a very painful death for you and all you care about.\u201d\u201cAll humans have this flaw, this capacity for malice. This is how I know that there is no omnipotent god worth worshipping. If there is, they created this flaw, or have the capability to change it. But they do not. If all of creation was designed by a god, or a series of gods, or however you might like to consider it, that means that they have devised every unhappiness and terror there is. Every pang of sorrow, every ounce of guilt. They have designed disease, monsters, dragons individuals who would see the world consumed by flames, and worst of all, humans themselves. If we were designed, this fatal flaw, this capacity for malice was designed to exist. If that is the case, I will worship no such god who did such a thing. If it is not, then there are no omnipotent gods to worship.\u201d\u201cAnyway. I digress. With that said, in an attempt to answer your question, \u2018What do I want out of this world?\u2019 as concisely as I can, I will say this. I have chosen to place value on interacting with and understanding other beings, and seem to enjoy doing what I can to enable those I care about to be happy, and expanding my capability to do so. My all of my most basic motivations are built upon this underlying reason I have given to my life, and it is by extension of this philosophy I have done all that I have so far, and I will continue to act in this manner until the hypothetical future when my philosophy changes.\u201dWith all of that said, Naoki takes a moment to clear her throat and consider if anything else needs to be said, but it does not.

Life is the only thing in the universe that can even ask what its meaning is. Whenever we chase after something, we're chasing after a small aspect of a greater truth... And once you realize that life is the most valuable thing in the universe, the answer to what to do with life becomes obvious.

Individual stories seem temporary, like they're disappearing, but they are connected to the rest of the universe and all the other infinite stories that life is capable of producing.\"By now she was speaking in earnest. She closed her diary. \"So in a way you got it right. Love and protect the people around you. It's the best way to achieve immortality... I guess that means I disagree with it being a joke. The way people try to pursue things in life, wealth, power, love, reputation, that's the joke. People chasing their own tails is the joke. Life is so much more that that. Life, life itself is amazing... And... I wish more people understood that.\" At these last words her face dropped and she became melancholy.But then her sheepish grin returned. \"Sorry, I wasn't trying to say you were wrong exactly, it's just how I see it. Two sides of the same coin, y'know? I became a lot more enthusiastic about life ever since Lum'Valia helped me become a holy mage. In the end, all holy teachings are about protecting the sanctity of life. Being selfless and loving towards others means that you understand you're part of a greater whole.

Before long, the first sheet is covered in copperplate letters, and it is pinned to one of the rolling boards. Another sheet joins it soon after, then another, then another. Pieces of string connect the sheets, and after several hours, the board is a web of parchment and multicolored strings that at first glance looks undecipherable, but upon further inspection is actually highly ordered. With her high-level architecture and planning done, Raiko channels a small amount of mana into a runic sequence on the side of her board, and watches in fascination as a perfect replica image forms in the fluid in the central well. Her comrades at the main compound of the Red Sisterhood have been busy, she muses. Moving to the well, she channels again into a set of runes on the sill, then places her hand on a crystal orb embedded into the stone.

Some of them, at least. There are many instances of housing throughout the tower, but these ones here are simply for your standard sorts of human soldiers.There\u2019s nothing\u2026 particularly special about any of them, beyond some of the accommodations that need to be made for some sorts, but all told\u2026 I believe that The Tower here can support\u2026 perhaps\u2026 twelve thousand individuals? Something around that many, I\u2019m not quite sure. Depends somewhat on how you classify an 'individual'.\u201dMadame Naoki waves dismissively at her own lack of definitive knowledge on the subject, and continues to gesticulate as she speaks and walks. \u201cWell. I say \u2018support\u2019, but a more accurate word would be \u2018house\u2019. Though there are wells on-site, there isn\u2019t nearly enough renewable food production within The Tower to support that many men indefinitely. There are fairly sizeable larders, yes, and ways to get food into the complex beyond walking it through the gate- tunnels and teleportation and the such, but in the event of a prolonged siege, that would be a concern.\u201dShe pauses in both speech and pace for a moment, realizing where her words have led. After taking a moment to compose herself, she continues, slower both in gait and cadence. \u201cThat was a bit of a tangent, I apologize. A prolonged siege is among the least likely scenarios that The Black Tower may face, and it\u2019s hardly a good place to start briefing you- I haven\u2019t even properly introduced myself. Though. I suppose our conversation last week sort of precluded that- you knew who I was when you walked in, but\u2026\u201dAgain, she stops in her stride, and turns to face Tristian, speaking emphatically with her hands in a more purposeful tone.\u00a0\u201cRegardless! Tristian! I\u2019m going to call you Tristian, if that\u2019s quite alright with you. Refer to me however you see fit. Like we discussed, you\u2019re going to take charge of the entire Black Tower organization, and run it in my stead. My involvement here is strictly confidential, and if anyone ever asks, you know me only as a positive acquaintance on strictly official terms. There are a number of higher ranking individuals within my organizations who are aware of the reality of things, but never assume, and never state publicly. Here, and in other private areas, we may do and say exactly whatever we please, but in official and public situations, keep your camaraderie to reasonable levels.\u201d\u201cWith that said, the purpose of our meeting today has a few purposes. First and foremost, it was my intention to meet you personally. And in that regard, I am satisfied so far, and hope to continue to become acquainted with you over the course of the day. The second goal is to give you the silver-coin-tour of the place, and offer some editorial comments on some particular features. It\u2019ll be on you to spend the time to learn The Tower\u2019s intricacies well enough to take full advantage of them, but you can do that in the fullness of your own time; I\u2019ve got other things to attend to, and don\u2019t even know this place particularly well myself. Beyond that, there are some procedural and mechanical directives and guidelines I intend to inform you of, so you might better do your job.\u201d\u201cRight. There we go. That was a proper opening, excellent. Third time's the charm, I suppose. Anyway, like I said, the barracks. Let\u2019s proceed.\u201d Seemingly satisfied with those words, she nods with an air of finality, and turns back to the hallway ahead, continuing to wave her hands about, but now with a slightly more casual and warm tone to the wavings and the accompanying speech. \u201cTo be completely honest for just a moment, I have absolutely no idea where this hallway leads. I suppose that I could check, but that would ruin some small portion of the surprise. It probably leads to some closet, or a lift or something equally dull. As we tread ever closer to that impending disappointment, do you have any questions about what I\u2019ve told you so far, or anything else, for that matter?

Cautiously, she applies the pressure of two fingers to the runic symbol.Immediately, the lift begins to move, creeping its way upward slowly.

Further thinking about it, Naoki realizes that she\u2019s never taken one of these lifts down, always having teleported out from the top or teleported in from the bottom. Do the lifts even go down? They must, surely. Otherwise all of the lifts would eventually get stuck at the top. However\u2026 considering the intricacies of the panel of runes before her, Naoki realizes that she has absolutely no idea how to make the lift do that. There must be at least twenty sigils on here- what do they even all do? It\u2019s a lift. It goes up, and it goes down. Why must it be so complex? Surely, a lever would do just as well, or simply just two inscriptions!

Supporting twelve thousand men within the tower here would be enormously expensive. In times of relative peace, there\u2019s no need to maintain quite so many as all that. Well. That, and it would be difficult to justify that many if anyone from Isra started asking questions.

It was enormously expensive- they billed me a ludicrous sum, but they tell me that it could- with some preparation and the right magitechs operating it- reduce Isra to ash, among other things.\u201dShe pauses for a moment, in reflection of that somewhat unsettling thought, before continuing with a bit of dry humor. \u201cI would ask that you check with me before doing anything quite like that, though. I\u2019m rather fond of the place, personally.\u201dThe remainder of the ride down to the forge is relatively uneventful. Madame Naoki notices Tristian\u2019s apparent interest in the intricacies of the uniform lift shaft, and suppressed a satisfied smirk. This is precisely the sort of  man she was looking for to fill this position, and this seems to be exactly the sort of dynamic she prefers to have. Shortly enough, the lift reaches their destination, and Madame Naoki leads the way off the lift, over to the forge. Rather than proceeding all the way down to the work floor, she opts to tour Tristian across the same catwalk Zurt had taken her across before. The forge itself is a massive room, likely one of the largest artificial subterranean rooms within the Tower complex. Roughly cubical, perhaps five stories to a side, their catwalk cuts directly across the center. Below, all manner of metalworking apparatus, smelteries, anvils, and anvil accessories surround a large, circular forge in the center of the room, the smokestack for which extends upward into the ceiling, causing their catwalk to curve in either direction around it. Workers putter about below, going about their business, moving to and fro, carrying their projects around. Naoki steps confidently forward across the slim bridge,  knowing Artemis to be only a step behind. She gestures around and downward, and speaks up slightly to be heard over the hammering and crackle of flames. \u201cThis is the forge! It\u2019s one of the largest of its type, and the workers down there, the dwarves, they\u2019re very skilled at their job. If you need something made, odds are that it can be made here. It\u2019s not always as busy as all this, but right now they\u2019re working on a project of mine. \u201dThe activity below seems somewhat chaotic, but an analytical look at the patterns of movement might suggest that the smiths are moving in a massively complicated, yet highly efficient sort of dance. Their activities seem to center around a series of structures in the far corner of the room, where one may be able to recognize a series of blast furnaces being fed by bellows being pumped by some manner of mechanical contrivance, crucibles filled with molten metal, and other bits and bobs related to the production of large metal plates and beams.Leaning to look down over the railing, Madame Naoki spends a few moments silently observing the proceedings. Turning her head slightly to speak to Tristian, she keeps her gaze trained downward. \u201cI\u2019ve always found it interesting to watch large, coordinated groups do things. Though I understand each of the individual processes they\u2019re accomplishing, I\u2019m not sure how they do it all so quickly and fluidly, in such a large group. How do they know where to move next? How do they time it so none of them are waiting, bumping into each other, or anything like that? I would assume that practice plays a large role, but it\u2019s still fascinating to watch.\u201d", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\u201cWell, it\u2019s basically a big sort of\u2026 I think they may have used the term \u2018"}, "post-35030": {"user": "Lord Tristian Seryl", "user_num": 1222, "timestamp": "1461693562000", "message": "Runic matrix.

It would probably be highly dangerous to stand where they\u2019re standing when the device is firing, she figures.Looking on the thing inspires a strange mix of emotions for Naoki. For one thing, it\u2019s incredibly dangerous. Even though she knows that it doesn\u2019t pose any threat to her, it could. Mistakes have been made before, and to stand so close to it\u2026 a somewhat frightening experience. Secondly, the power. The Kami positively radiates power, and it is hers to command. To think... She could, at any moment, point to something- anything, issue an order, and have whatever the object in question is utterly obliterated in a matter of seconds by this terrifying weapon\u2026 Such power, literally at her fingertips, equal parts satisfying and terrifying to contemplate.Lastly, the fullness of the situation strikes her. Here she is, standing atop this Black Tower. Easily one of the most powerful military installations in the world. To one side, one of the foremost geniuses in the fields runic magic and artifice- responsible for the terrifying weapon before them. To her other side, an (admittedly deposed) Medanese nobleman. Both of them, her contractually bound employees. To consider the fullness of this situation, in the context that only a few year prior, Naoki had been scrubbing the floors of a crummy bar to earn food for the day\u2026 It\u2019s almost humorous, in a somewhat frightening sort of way. That blend of emotions aside, the Kami is undeniably an impressive feat of engineering. Even though she cannot begin to grasp at the principles behind it, the stated capabilities alone are worthy of admiration. However, while they\u2019re up here, Naoki decides to turn her back on the Kami to admire the view from atop the tower. In a manner quite reminiscent of that view from the mountainside, the landscape of the Free Plans stretches before her in all directions. Travelers on the roads are as ants, and far to the west\u2026 the ocean is almost visible. However, before Naoki can spend too much time admiring the view, a particularly stiff gust of wind strikes her from behind, ruffling her peplum in ways it was never meant to be ruffled, nearly causing her to lose balance. She regains her footing easily, but that\u2019s quite enough of that, thank you very much. She wastes no time in following Raiko right back down the ladder, and into the relative safety of the indoors. Again, she has no questions, and after straightening her attire, looks to Tristian, figuring he must at least have some manner of inquiry.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "A slight smirk worms its way across Madame Naoki\u2019s face as Tristian jumps.

This alcove was across the hall from another which, he noticed with some curiosity was labeled, Sauna. His brows shot upward in surprise. \"..I will most certainly be coming back to investigate this in the immediate future. But for now...\"He moved back across the hall to the alcove that bore his designation beside the doors. On a whim, he pressed his hand to the door leading to the office, and felt a small jolt as magic warding the room assessed him. The runes inlaid into and surrounding the door flickered with an intense glow, before the door whooshed open before him. Stepping into the room, Tristian looked around with an openly impressed expression. Either the prior occupant of this office had excellent tastes, or things had been redecorated to suit the perceived interests of the new leader. There was a plush carpet laid across the floor between the door and the heavy mahogany desk that displayed an old-world map of the Overworld, and there were bookshelves lining the walls, filled with tomes and scrolls of all sorts that he itched to investigate. Two chairs of the same material as the desk sat before it, upholstered in dark blue fabric that looked soft to the touch. A larger and much more imposing chair sat on the far side of the desk, its tall back crowned with the sigil of the Black Tower in slick ebony wood that gleamed slickly in the light of the magical lights set into the open portions of the wall, not to mention the one perched upon the desk. \"I approve wholeheartedly, and shall explore later.\"Abandoning the office, he moved back out the door and across the small alcove to the door across the way, clearly labeled as his living quarters. Repeating the process of pressing his hand to the door and letting the wards recognize their new master, he then moved into the suite of rooms which were his. The sitting room was decorated in a similar fashion to the office, albeit missing the map-rug, and replaced instead with a large rug with an exotic pattern that spanned a range of blues and golds. There were two plushly-padded wingback chairs in dark blue before what appeared to be a magical fireplace, just to the right of the door upon entry, and a small table between them. Against the wall just past the seating area was a rolltop mahogany desk with a smaller but equally comfortable-looking chair set before it. On the other side of the room from the desk was a wall of bookshelves, also stuffed near to bursting with books, and near that was a large chaise lounge upholstered in the same dark blue fabric, with its own personal mahogany table set before it; tucked into a corner near both the lounge and the books was a well-stocked liquor cabinet, complete with decanter and a quartet of tumblers set atop its gleaming wooden surface. The whole room was gently lit by the same magical lamps which had inhabited his office, crystals exuding a warm yellow-white glow that was easy on the eyes but perfectly comfortable to read by.Not stopping to think about the women accompanying him and excited at the prospect of seeing his sleeping area looked like, Tristian proceeded toward the door set into the wall between the bookshelves and the rolltop desk, which slid open at his approach. The theme of mahogany wood and dark blue fabrics was continued in this room, exemplified in the monstrosity of a king-sized bed which dominated the far wall, its headboard inlaid with the sigil of the Black Tower in that same slick ebony wood. There was a small mountain of pillows at the head (Odd; how had they known he liked lots of pillows?), and another rug spread across the otherwise bare stone floor. Against the right wall was an expansive armoire, as well as a clearly-designated dressing area, that even bore a sturdy stand for his armor and a rack on which to hang his sword, with a short dresser meant for the smaller non-hanging items and a full-length mirror. A doorway to the left likely led to a private bathing area that he was perfectly assured was entirely up to par with the rest of the rooms, and which he would investigate later at his leisure.\"I am immensely impressed.\" Speaking that comment aloud was what made him realize that he was, in fact, in his bedchambers.

The idea is that one goes in, has a seat, and enjoys a short while in the steamy room. Between the steam and one\u2019s perspiration, things tend to get rather wet. I wouldn\u2019t much care to wear around a damp uniform for the rest of the day, and I\u2019m willing to bet that the sauna would absolutely ruin that nice coat of yours. As such, the concept is such that one leaves their clothing here, and proceeds into the sauna without it.\u201dWith that said, Naoki evidently finishes changing, as she appears around the edge of the divider, a towel wrapped about her torso, and another smaller towel held in her left hand. She pauses for a moment to exhale sharply at the sight of Tristian, sitting there, staring directly ahead, before pushing on the the door with her right hand. The door is evidently somewhat more difficult to open than she anticipated, not budging with her casual application of pressure. In response, she leans into the motion, bare feet struggling to gain traction on the smooth floor, and the towel nearly becoming dislodged as a result. However, she manages it, and the door slowly opens on creaking hinges. The room beyond- the sauna itself, is somewhat larger than the preparation room. A square room, perhaps five meters to a side, with two concentric levels of polished wooden benches ringing the three walls not holding the door. The walls themselves are made of well fit stone bricks, a design decision that helps to allow the room retain heat. In the center of the otherwise empty floor space, a small pile of somewhat greenish rocks sit in a circular depression, covered by a metal grate at floor level. A small grayish square shape sits on the floor directly before the grating, with a few runic symbols inlaid upon it. It is before this box that Naoki crouches, reaching down with one hand to touch, while the other hand holds the towel steady. After a moment of this fiddling, a chute in the ceiling directly above the grate begins to discharge water at an alarming rate, which crashes down through the grate onto the stones below. Evidently, the stones are quite hot, and cause the water to evaporate essentially instantaneously. Not only is Naoki blasted by the sudden burst of steam, and not only is the sauna room filled with steam, but it also manages to roll across the floor and out the door into the preparation room. A short yelp of surprise also makes its way back out into the preparation room. Again, Naoki\u2019s lack of expertise when it comes to operating rune panels comes to bite her, in a more surprising and decidedly more disrobing manner than previously. She had raised her hand to shield her face, and the towel had indeed been dropped. However, after a few moments of irritated grumbling and incessant fumbling through closed eyes, she manages to get the flow of water under control, down to a moderate, yet steady stream. Clouds of steam still billow up to fill the room, and still may be described as excessive, but at the very least, they\u2019re not quite so explosive as previously. This seems to be enough to satisfy Naoki for the time being, as she picks her towel up from the floor, makes her way over to the right side of the room, spreads the towel out on the upper bench, and proceeds to lie down upon it. The smaller cloth is placed across her face, obscuring her vision even more so than the thick clouds of steam, and having the effect of shielding one\u2019s face from the steam, consequently leading to a more preferable distribution of heat over the body.

After numerous dates and many hours spent with her, I was sitting alone, in my office, around midnight, writing about the past day in my journal. In writing, my train of thought meandered toward the future, and in considering how I would like it to proceed, I realized that I would like my future to be with her. From that realization, I eventually reached the conclusion, in consciously evaluating everything I knew about her up to that point, that with all of that considered, I loved her, based upon a relatively full understanding of who she is, which I had acquired gradually over those months. Based upon little things, such as how and when she is charitable, which things upset her the most and how she acts when upset, her principles, morals, and other such aspects of who she is as a person.\u201d\u201cFor as much as I tend to be very quick about hiring strangers and placing them into positions of importance- yourself a primary example, that swiftness is only applied professionally. Personally, I take time- perhaps too much time, to develop personal relationships. Another example can be seen in Skarlet. I\u2019ve still not internally come to terms with the fact that she is my responsibility, my daughter, even though it\u2019s been\u2026 what, a year or so since I adopted her? \u2026\u201dNaoki trails off, thinking back on the date before nodding slowly.\u201cYes, about one year. Anyway, when I\u2019m with her, I\u2019m not quite sure how to act. Often, I end up simply trying to emulate what I think a good mother ought to do, rather than being one myself. Conversely, she seems to have bonded to me about as much as she\u2019s going to.\u201dNaoki offers a defeated sort of shrug, the first display of emotion since she began.\u201cSo, when you- or anyone else, for that matter, come and say, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve met this wonderful individual last week, and we\u2019re to be married as soon as possible!\u2019, it strikes me as odd. Just because I don\u2019t think in that way- I can\u2019t understand it because my methodology for forming personal relationships is so wildly different. I don\u2019t mean to imply that I think you\u2019ve made a poor choice- that\u2019s not my evaluation to make. Nor do I mean to suggest that you spend more time in making such decisions, or tell you how to live your life in any capacity. It isn\u2019t of any particular concern to me, after all, as I trust you will continue to perform what duties I require of you whether you\u2019re married or not, and regardless of the quality of that marriage.

In the center of the roof, The Black Tower\u2019s superweapon - The Kami, sits impassively, its runes glowing slightly in the night to lend Naoki some vision. A unique weapon, it may be most aptly compared to a catapult whose mechanism is not related to leverage or any rational concept of physics, but rather, runic magics of the strongest magnitude. Its missile is not any ordinary boulder, either. The Kami delivers to its target pillars of stone taller than Naoki\u2019s person, themselves covered in runes which function to add to their destructive potential.The Kami is one of the very few things, in Naoki\u2019s opinion, that could reasonably dent The Citadel, such as it is. The Kami has been used in the past to defend Isra from colossal beasts who threatened the city - to great effect. Its mere presence is an excellent deterrent to any wishing to stage a large assault on The Free Plains, making it a valued, if not often used, tool.There\u2019s a certain sense of sobriety in commanding such a weapon, Naoki thinks. One word from her could destroy any given element of the far off Norkari Mountain range or reduce the majority of Isra to ashes. A few more words would flatten it, with all that entails. A real sense of gravity, especially so while she\u2019s standing her next to it. It seems much larger than she remembered, looking at it like this. Naoki considers taking cover from the wind behind one of its pillars. After a moment, she decides not, figuring it best not to tempt the powerful magics, inactive as though they may be.And so Naoki stands alone on the rooftop, wind whipping at her from every direction. Her hair pulled back into a braid, isn\u2019t as much trouble as she thought it might be. However, her choice of attire was\u2026 not among her most wise, Naoki thinks. This is not skirt weather.Crossing her arms over her chest, Naoki squints down toward Isra, mess of lights that it is. The braziers along the walls are easily identified - a dotted outline. The center of the city is brightest, most visible; the outskirts are all but invisible, few torches burn there. A truly unique vantage, this. Naoki can associate a few large points of light with landmarks around the city - that bluish one is the statue in the Central Plaza, for instance.But Naoki didn\u2019t come all the way up here for the view.

Reese shuffled down the hallway with his assortment of foci and channeling crystals, moving as quickly as he could without unbalancing the stack. He had theoretically been prepared for the ritual some time ago, but he had made the grave mistake of picking up a particularly good book. Only hours later did he look up and realize that, well, hours had passed.It was, he reflected, perhaps a rather bad precedent to set. Even if one were to somehow ignore the fact that he had vanished for a period of years, being late to his first assignment didn't exactly scream reliability. Perhaps he should consider restructuring the magic that gave him sentience. It had been a while since he had given it a good, solid poke, and binding himself more thoroughly to deadlines seemed quite the responsible thing to do.Before he could drag himself down the long, winding road of the philosophical implications rewriting the self might invoke, he climbed up a small set of stairs to a rather hefty hatch and attempted to nudge it open. The hatch, rather impolitely, chose to ignore the slight nudge and stay firmly closed.With a sigh, Reese placed his collection of ritual implements on the ground and freed the walking stick from a loop of his belt. When a person was a mere collection of floating bones, moving heavy objects was notoriously tricky. Magic proved an excellent solution.A single finger tapped the end of the stick, causing runes to flare down the length of the staff. He slid his hand down the length of it and reached up, tapping the hatch with the end. The successive blast of magical force was quite capable of shoving the heavy hatch open.

Madame, 'Grandma', so good to see you both.\"The wind, as if mirroring the reception he was surely receiving, chose just that moment to pick up.
