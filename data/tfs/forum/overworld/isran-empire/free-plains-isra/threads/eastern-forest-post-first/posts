The eastern edge of the Plains is denoted by the beginning of a large forest, easily the largest in the area. Isra harvests much of its lumber from this forest. Of Isra\u2019s borders, this one is perhaps the most difficult to defend, due to the nature of it being the edge of a forest and as such not being a very easy natural border to control. That said, the majority of Isra\u2019s border guards sit not at this forest, but rather at the Silverion River, over which there are but two bridges. This is a far superior natural border to defend, and any looking to enter Isra from the east would be required to pass over the river. However, guard outposts are spread across the Plains near the forest to ensure that any looking to enter unlawfully would not be entirely unopposed, and any large creature or group will be sighted before they get close to the river.Directly on the other side of the forest, further to the east, one would find themselves in The Expanse (territory of The Land Tillers\u2019 State), at their Western Draconic Forest Edge. A road has been created between Isra and The Expanse, and it is this road that essentially all of the trade and traffic between the two nations travels. This road is patrolled and guarded at both ends. Some portions of the Eastern Forest are dangerous, and those looking to forage in the wrong areas may sometimes find themselves lost, never to be found. It is generally known that the southern portions of this forest are Misty. As such, the southern portions of the forest are respected and hardly ever entered. Which areas of the forest are misty are unclear, and haven\u2019t been mapped in any decisive manner due to the difficulty of the task.

The trees rustled quietly as the breeze passed through them, and the sound of the nearby stream flowing were the only sounds. Crouched next to one of these trees, Marius Alistair, Captain of the Rangers of Denaria, watched silently as a deer walked across the path in front of him. His cloak, shaded in dark green and brown, helped him blend in with the environment better than a solid green or brown one could. As the deer lowered its head to graze on the grass at its feat, Marius slowly raised his bow up, drawing back the arrow silently. In a split second, he released the shot, and the deer jerked in place, before collapsing to the ground, an arrow through its eye and head.Standing up, Marius pulled down his hood, revealing a heavily bearded and scarred face. Bringing his hands up to his mouth, he gave a sharp whistle into the air, and a few moments later, three young lads came running into the area. \"Get that back to the camp, quickly.\" The boys quickly nodded at the Rangers words, before hefting the deer between the three of them, and setting off back the way they had come. Setting out after them, Marius briefly glanced back where he had been crouched, and the area around it, before turning and jogging after the kids.\u00a0After nearly half an hour of travel, Marius and the three boys came to a small clearing. Coming to a halt, Marius raised his hand briefly, feeling eyes on him. Whistling once more, he gave three short chirps, before pausing, and repeating the sound. Moments later, three figures, wearing the same cloaks as Marius, emerged from the shadows of the trees, bows held loosely at their side. Nodding to his men, Marius gestured for the boys to continue on, while he hung back. Once the boys were out of ear shot, he walked towards the leader of the small group.\"Any more reports on the city nearby?\" Shaking his head, the other Ranger quickly responded. \"We have seen a lot of activity, the few excursions we have made in that direction can only be at night. We know its a big city.\" Sighing, Marius nodded to the Ranger Veteran, before walking through the clearing, leaving the others to return to their watch.Emerging from the trees, Marius let a brief smile play across his face as he saw the camp. Wooden walls surrounded the entire exterior, only a few feet high, but enough to keep the wind out. Around that wall, numerous spikes were thrust into the ground, discouraging any local animals from coming too close to the camp. Passing through the only gap in the wall, Marius entered the center of the camp. Hundreds of people were scattered around, with numerous tents set up in neat orderly rows. Men, women, and children were going about their every day tasks, wearing the brown clothes all Denarians wore these days. Scattered among the crowds, Marius spotted a few cloaks belonging to the Rangers, but they were rare. Walking through the crowds, Marius nodded his head to the few people who called out to him, as his way towards the center of the camp. There, he entered a tent, the same as the rest, where he quickly placed down his bow, before falling to his knees, and laying down on the pallet he had laid out. He fell asleep quickly after that.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The forest was quiet today.

Today particularly, Dawn Rider patrols have been increased due to the current state of war, to remain exceptionally vigilant for a possible Goraian counterattack, or other hostile parties looking to take advantage of the majority of Isra\u2019s military being deployed away from the city. One of these patrols is currently flying along the treeline where the Eastern Forest meets the Plains. The day so far has been all but totally uneventful, which, given the tension, isn\u2019t quite how some might prefer it. However, off to the left, what\u2019s that? Smoke. Through a short series of hand signals, the pair communicates to each other, and opt to check it out. Banking to the left, the riders direct their griffins about to approach the source of the smoke and fly in a roughly circular shape around it at a fair distance. It would seem to be a clearing, of the particularly large and man-made sort. Within, tents. Tents, and people, and small fires, presumably being used to cook with. A camp of some sort. Interesting. The riders opt to come closer, for a better look. Maintaining a substantial altitude, they fly past the camp but do not pass directly overhead. This better look reveals that there aren\u2019t any visible banners displaying the allegiance of whoever\u2019s camp this is and would seem to indicate that whatever the purpose of the camp is, it isn\u2019t that of war, given how none of the individuals within were wearing shining armor or carrying anything that seemed like a metal weapon - which would presumably be quite obvious.

Trogdor was cruel and because of this, he saw no value in pity. Monster that he was, Trogdor cared only for power. Bandits killed was power lost in the eyes of the dragon. It was wasted potential for them to kidnap humans and torture them. Such inane violence was worthless. The difference between a bandit and a soldier was the principles of the force that governed them. Trogdor needed to show the Empress that he was at least lawful, if not completely pure of intent.

They will not simply be forced into cooperation. They will do it because society must evolve least it destroy itself.\" Trogdor paused here to give weight to those words. It was imperative that the Empress understand that despite the darkness in Trogdor's heart he strove for unity, if only for the sake of greater power.

Even the poorest human will be raised to the middle class, where they can benefit the economy by becoming traders, entrepreneurs, and philosophers. Once all creatures can live together the creative potential is unlimited.\u201d In Trogdor\u2019s mind his kingdom would be a utopia. A beacon by the sea.

The great vine-walls that once marked the borders of the area where the Wyld holed up to refresh its power after its defeat have since receded, leaving only a strange, dark expanse of forest in its place. Dense thickets of thick, black-barked trees with violet-hued leaves not quite shaped like oaks have sprung up in place of the healthy verdant green of the forest before. The soil itself has become so dark as to seem charred, yet evidently quite fertile, as the underbrush grows dense and tall. There are few paths through this expanse of blighted lands now, and those few too adventurous or too foolish to keep out have come to know the land's fauna well -- packs of huge, vicious wolves with reflective purple eyes stalk the night and flocks of carrion crows harass intruders relentlessly. No beast that is born of those woods is mundane; every rabbit, badger, fox, or squirrel is born with black fur and a pair of violet eyes. Those who are lucky enough survive a night in the forest wake to find their food and provisions missing, and often find themselves in completely unknown depths of the wood. Even the trees themselves seem to loom over those who enter, the feeling of being watched by unwelcoming eyes impossible to shake.Roots often whip out to trip intruders, and many a tent has been crushed by falling branches or swallowed by suddenly infirm earth. The sounds that haunt the night are the stuff of nightmares, the calls of far-off beasts never seen by human eyes echoing through the wood. The few travelers who have escaped the wood with their lives report great winged beasts with bodies of roiling smoke flying overhead in the dark of night, their eyes glowing a sinister amethyst. As yet, the Isran quarantine teams have felt it too costly to mount proper excursions, preferring to keep their operations to containment exclusively. However, in recent months there have been more attempts by the forest to breach the quarantine, seeming to be almost organised. Waves of shambling, vine-ridden possessed crash against Isra's defences, probing for a chink in the armour. It would seem that dark things are stirring once more in the blighted lands, and a permanent solution is no more forthcoming now than it was when the dragon-lady Freyja, Lady of the Moon      , vanished into her cave, apparently unsuccessful in finding her proposed final nail in the coffin of the Wyld's possessed avatar, Andraste Ruana       .However, there may yet be hope, as an unlikely ally is roused once again in the North. A raven perches upon the branch of a black-barked tree at the edge of the blighted lands, peering into the depths of the forest. Its feathers are unkempt and its eyes are coloured a strange, dull green. It cocks its head this way and that, hopping from one branch to another, yet apparently reluctant to go further into the wood. It gives a kraa and turns about, taking to the skies in a flurry of shimmering black feathers. The raven wheels around to fly northward, and disappears over the horizon.", "link_list": ["/user/1149", "/user/264"], "image_list": [], "html": "<b>[One month before the Isra-Black Vale non-aggression pact]</b>"}, "post-95448": {"user": "Andraste Ruana", "user_num": 264, "timestamp": "1581323701000", "message": "Deep within the center of the blighted lands of the Eastern Forest there stands a great tree with sinews of thick, jet black bark trailing up into a flare of dark purple leaves. The tree is like none that have been seen since before the Cataclysm, yet its true secret lies beneath, in a ten meter by ten meter orb of twisted roots, wrapped about a hollow center. There in the inky blackness, a woman in faded, battered red robes sits, legs crossed, eyes closed. Thin, ever-shifting black vines with thorns like needles dip in and out of unclosing gashes that dot her body from toe to collarbone. The only remaining unmarred surface is her face, which is as comely and unblemished as the day she was possessed. There is no recollection of the powerful sorceress she once was. There is only what she has become. The avatar of the Wyld, the bringer of doom to the civilised world and protector of the natural. She who will wash the world clean of the sapient plague that destroys all natural life it stumbles across, she who will correct the mistake the gods once made in allowing these pests to exist. For Andraste and the Wyld speak with one voice.It is not time, not yet. But soon. Soon the Wyld will be strong enough, and will rise once again. The last attempt ended in a minor setback, but while these sapients grow old, decrepit, the Wyld is eternal. The Wyld can wait. They will eventually have to come to it should they wish to avert their own destruction, and by then it will be too late. Even now, the roots grow deep, probing the defenses of the so-called protectors, those Isran Enclave scum that poke at the Wyld's borders and prevent its growth, deny it its true potential. The Wyld will wait. It will be patient. And then, when the sapients think it is truly, finally contained, the hour of their doom will be upon them, for that is when the Wyld will strike.Andraste's eyes open, but eyes they are not. Where once there were orbs of flesh and blood, now her sockets are filled with a bright purple glow, and as she stands, her body creaks like a willow tree bending to the wind. Her bare feet hiss across the ground as she steps toward the wall of the root sanctuary, and the walls part, the very earth obeying her command and spreading before her as she ascends to the forest floor above. She looks to the skies, and the full moon peers back, illuminating the blighted lands in a soft silver glow. Even the avatar of the moon herself could not find a way to stop the Wyld. The sapients have no hope. This world will be returned to the natural order, soon enough.
