There were no horses to draw it, yet it seemed to \"trot\" all the same as if it were pulled by a finely paired team. The season was crisp, yet not unpleasant, as the Chateau itself was located so far south of Isra that the snows of the city did not reach to the vineyard or the land beyond it. When the carriage stopped, the door opened on it's own, and a beautiful blonde woman of mature years stepped down from the carriage, beautifully dressed in a silhouette that was gracefully snug to her frame. Her skirt was long and trailed a little behind her, but it was not voluminous, the material naturally falling where it would. She wore a shirt above with pearl buttons that ran from her wrist to her elbow, the sleeves loosened to her shoulders before the blouse became tight and curved to her breasts and torso, pearl buttons mirrored at the high neck. Her blonde hair was artfully gathered, earrings subtly glittering at her lobes. There was a jacket slung over one arm that she was not using, and gloves ensconced her slender hands -- and immediately reached inside the carriage to help a boy of ten and a girl of eight down the steps that had unfolded and onto the hard-packed driveway of the Chateau.A sense of old world grace was a perfume around the blonde woman, making it easy to believe that she belonged to sophisticated royalty. Even so, there wasn't an ounce of coldness that came from her, and as soon as she took each of the children in hand and came forward to greet whoever was there to greet them, she smiled -- and it was a lovely, lovely thing.\"Bonjour,\" she said to whoever greeted them. \"I am Genevieve St. James and these are my wards, Etienne and Marie Therese Valois.\" Her voice was warm and inviting. It would take a very hard-hearted person to dislike Genevieve, or either one of the children who bowed or curtsied upon introduction.Etienne was dark haired and handsome, with untrusting, almost hostile, blue eyes. Marie Therese also had dark hair, but dark red ran through it, making it appear more chestnut than the deep mahogany of her brother. Her gaze was also a crystal clear blue, and she appeared fragile. Both held tightly onto Genevieve's hands, and Etienne's grip on her was almost white-knuckled.Still, Lady Genevieve did not appear uncomfortable, and called no further attention to herself and the children other than to arrive and patiently wait to be shown to Monsieur Charlemagne.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "It was yet another few days before a handsome and well-sprung coach came down the winding lane to the Chateau.

It seemed that the clothier had judged how different the weather would be at the winery - the warmer climes of the south meant there was no snow to be seen, unlike in the city of Isra. Workers dotted the fields, combing the vines for diseases, infestations and imperfections, maintaining the integrity of the plants that looked fresh and alive, despite the cooler season. When the carriage did inevitably come to a halt at the ch\u00e2teau itself, it would find, for a moment, that nobody came to receive it. There was a stream of labourers entering and exiting the main building, but they mostly ignored the coach, other than regarding it with a curious intrigue.Eventually, though, a young, sprightly gentleman exited amidst the flow of people and greeted the trio in the carriage. He was better-dressed than the rest of the workers, and kept a small spyglass tied around his neck. \"Greetings madame,\" he began, offering a nod to each of the children simultaneously, \"and thank you for making haste here as you have. My name is Mathys Picard - I am the ch\u00e2teau's foreman, and, once the winery itself opens, ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel. Monsieur de Sauveterre is inside - please, follow me.\"Picard led the visitors inside through a different door that led to the body of the restaurant-hotel portion of the winery, rather than the dormitory and mess hall. He had a Gauldish accent, albeit faded - he had clearly been outside of Gauldin for some time. \"Thank you, mademoiselle, for the work you've done in Gauldin.\" Picard spoke idly as they travelled through the building to Charlemagne's study. \"I am glad to hear that someone is willing and able to help the people of my homeland. Charlemagne is in here.\"He pulled open the door, allowing the group to enter. It was quite tall, lined on most sides with bookshelves. A dining table, surrounded by chairs, sat towards one side of the room, made of a similar dark wood to the bookshelves and furnishings. Towards the other side sat a collection of chairs and couches.It was the centre of the room, though, that demanded attention. A tall, leather wingback chair faced a large crystalline structure that appeared embedded in the wall. It was dusky in appearance, like a smoky quartz, shot with streaks of orange and purple, like a cloudy sunset.It was from that chair that Charlemagne de Sauveterre spoke as he regarded the crystal. \"Mademoiselle St James? A pleasure.\" He took a deep breath, as if pondering his next words, whilst the door behind the trio, who presumedly had come in, swung closed. They would not be able to see him from behind the chair. \"I suppose I should first admit that I have led you here under false pretenses.

She noticed Mathys' approach before he spoke, and she squeezed the hands of the children to get their attention focused once more.Her smile blossomed again for Mathys as she nodded her head. \"Of course,\" she murmured, then momentarily turned to look at the carriage. She had to take her hand from Marie Therese's own, and the girl immediately wrapped an arm around Genevieve's white skirt as the enchantress gracefully spun her wrist. A carpet bag came floating out, the carriage door closing on its own, and the carriage itself rolling away so it could make a turn and come to a stop in anticipation of the enchantress' departure from the chateau.\"Come along,\" she said to Etienne and Marie Therese, once more taking the girl child's hand from her skirts to walk behind Mathys. Neither one of the children seemed willing to leave Genevieve's side, but they were clearly very curious of the place as they came in from the sunlight to walk the halls. Etienne idly undid his jacket, as the crisp winter air outside seemed not to effect the inside of the hotel.\"I wish I could do more,\" Genevieve said to Mathys in a gentle and quiet voice, not wishing to discuss the Revolucion in depth when Etienne and Marie Therese were near. \"But I am so pleased that former natives of Gauldin are willing to open their homes to so many in need, like Monseiur Sauveterre.\"Picard opened the door to a study and the threesome (plus the bag) walked in. It smelled of book leather and cleanliness, but Genevieve felt a fissure of alarm that she was talking to the back of the chair. Having so soon returned from a war-torn country, she had found that herself less... inviting... than she had been in the past, and more insulted by small gestures than before as well.And, of course, the quiet click of the closing door, and the masculine voice that spoke to her --I suppose I should first admit that I have led you here under false pretenses. It is not clothes that I seek.-- did not help her feel comfortable at all. The children understood the words as well and pressed closer into Genevieve's skirts. She carefully took her hands from their grip -- just in case -- and settled them, instead, upon their little shoulders.\"Non?\" she asked, her voice as gentle as always, but perhaps ringing a little more clearly. \"You will then, perhaps, tell me what it is you seek?

That question can only be answered once I tell you what I sought. I sought that,\" Charlemagne said, whirling about to point at the crystal, \"and with it, I sought safety.

His shoulders slumped, and her gaze narrowed on his back.The elegant enchantress said nothing, but was prepared to defend to her last breath. When Charlemagne turned around, however--her heart skipped a beat.It happened all at once -- the look of surprise, the look of recognition, the widening of her eyes, the relaxing of her shoulders and her posture, her lush mouth gently parting with a gasp that fled from her chest. \"Ryden,\" she whispered his name, then gave a slight shake of her head. A single strand of golden hair fell from the way it was artfully piled on her head to curve against her face. \"Ryden,\" she said his name more clearly, but couldn't move from where she stood given how the children were clinging to her. \"I don't-- I don't understand?\" She gestured subtle to their surroundings and took a hesitant step forward.The little fists of the children burried deeper into her skirts and she looked down at them. \"Do not be afraid,\" Genevieve said to them, sweeping a gentle hand over each of their heads, even as their blue eyes seemed to stare across the room at Ryden Greyiron, Chancellor of Isra. \"This man is my...\"Friend?

Perhaps he had. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Sorry that I had to bring you here like this. But for the time being, that crystal has kept me safe. Kept my secret.\u201d\"I'm sure you remember, but when last we spoke I was in Tawakoshi, on a diplomatic mission. I received your letter while I was there, but failed to see how I could return a message. I don't imagine Gauldin's postal service was functioning, which, I assume, is where you were. As such, I didn\u2019t reply, expecting that I would be able to aid you in your mission when I returned to Isra.\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, that did not... eventuate in the way I had hoped. Towards the end of my visit I went for a walk through Quying to see what the city looked like in the witching hours. As I walked through the city I was seized, captured, and taken away. I... suffice to say, I have experienced mental and physical pain in my life. Never before to that extent. Never again.\u201dHe sighed again. It was a  bitter sigh, sorrowful and angry, accentuating the weariness of his face and his demeanour, reliving times that need not be relived. \u201cBut, after what I place as about a month, they made an error, an error that I exploited to the best of my abilities. That error left me lost, wandering in the middle of a Tawakoshi forest, without food, shelter, or any sense of direction. I wandered that forest for a week, desperately scavenging anything I could find, before good fortune smiled upon me, and I found a trail.\u201d\u201cFollowing the trail, I arrived in a small town - a hamlet, really - where by exceptional providence I encountered Charlemagne de Sauveterre, an old friend of mine from days gone by. I explained my predicament to him, and it was he who endowed me with the ability to disguise myself as him, and helped me craft the plan that would see me return to Isra.\u201dFor the first time since he had started telling the story, his stormy, dark blue eyes met her bright cerulean, a strange combination of resolve and fear in them he knew she would be able to see. \u201cA plan was necessary, for I fear my disappearance was no mere coincidence. The reprehensible vermin that captured me seemed to be lying in wait, and the elite guardsmen that were assigned to me did naught to protect me. I do not want to imply that a conspiracy to cause my death led to my capture, but the evidence seems to indicate that. When I do return to the city, it will have to be emphatic enough that should I go missing again, smoke and mirrors will not deter the people from observing such an absence.\u201dRyden screwed up his nose as he closed his eyes, considering his words carefully, for they were the most important and the most likely to change things. \u201cThere is a... more personal reason I brought you here, though... When I pushed myself to walk through the nights along the trail, when I contemplated lying down and awaiting my death instead of getting on my knees and crawling through the forest with what little energy I had left, when I steeled myself against the cut of a blade or the swing of a club, you were one of the thoughts that strengthened my resolve and kept burning my will to live. Your face, your voice, your heart and your mind kept me moving, kept me living. I know it\u2019s not fair to say such a thing - we have only known each other for a short time. But it is true, and I have always felt this compulsion towards you. Even if you walk away from here today, right now \u2014 for which I would not blame you, not attempt to impede you \u2014 you will have my utmost support in your endeavours, in any capacity I can grant it.\u201dA new expression overtook his countenance - one of tiredness.

They didn't even speak to each other, for they knew that Matheus could understand the words said.When Genevieve came into the room, they immediately brightened -- but almost with a sense of desperation.
