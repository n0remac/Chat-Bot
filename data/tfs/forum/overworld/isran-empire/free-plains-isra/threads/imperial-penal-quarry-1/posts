It is populated by convicts, charged with heinous crimes and sentenced to hard labor. The convicts spend sixteen hours per day breaking rocks with large hammers, cracking them into cobblestones or crushing them into gravel. Armed guards and supervisors roam the quarry, making sure that quotas are met and that nobody tries to do anything sneaky. In all its years of operation, the Rock Garden has had no reported escapes.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.pinimg.com/originals/6a/5d/d5/6a5dd55ac4b3698bf42cadf313aa2f2d.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/6a/5d/d5/6a5dd55ac4b3698bf42cadf313aa2f2d.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}}
