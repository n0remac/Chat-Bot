Sharp edge.\" he repeated a confirmation of Kelda's request, a bit calmer himself for hearing her to be lucid enough to suggest a way they might get the net off of her, and back to the ocean.Looking around, the small blue creature at first glance would find no such rocks. The ocean and weather had spent millennia wearing each and every surface of the rocks in their general vicinity smooth. This, again, would seem like both a blessing and a curse, as if the rocks were sharp, they well would have killed Kelda as she was tossed upon them; to say nothing of what shape Squigg would have been in trying to reach her if somehow Kelda had managed to survive.Squigg bent to pick up a small rock about the size of his hand. Like every other rock in the vicinity, it had been worn into a near perfect oval shape, but this one was slightly different. It was a much darker color, nearly black, with some faint striations in it.\"I've got to make one!\" he gurgled, a bit of the urgency returning as he turned and moved away from Kelda.Squigg placed the small black stone on a much larger rock, only half of which was poking up through the sand of the shore; a perfect anvil. With a bit of testing, wiggling, and pulling of the rocks around him, Squigg was able to loosen and then dislodge a much larger rock from the ground. The Merfolk hefted the rock above his head in his webbed hands, and smashed it down into the small stone, which promptly cracked into several bits. Success. It seemed as if the pair had caught their first bit of luck as part of the small black stone cracked off into a sharp blade with just a few serrations in it.\"Kelda! I've got it!\" Squigg bubbled as he picked the rock up and wobbled back to his friend.In his hurry and unfamiliarity with dry land, Squigg would make no allowances for his forward momentum as he moved, and toppled over perhaps a step/slither sooner than where he'd planned to stop. Undeterred, Squigg pushed himself the last few inches and came to rest close enough to Kelda to begin cutting the netting wrapped around her wrist.The netting was tough, and it took some sawing, but it eventually would begin to fray, and then give in and be cut.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Squigg's weapon of choice had served him well for many years; it was strong, sufficiently pointy for any stabbing/harpooning he needed done, and its jagged points and asymmetrical shape made it ideal for defending himself as it tended to rip holes more than cut cleanly into the flesh of attackers. This last point, one he prized the spear for, now seemed to be its biggest downfall.
