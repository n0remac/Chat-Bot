Her brow furrowed as she gazed intently at the rune on his chest, still revealed by the presence of the ritual she had created. Releasing a small burst of magic, the silvery shimmers shot forward, revealing themselves to be needles, each with a thin near invisible thread attached to the end of them. The needles penetrated the skin around the runes, bending with ease as they began to rapidly wind the thread around the rune while being careful to avoid puncturing any internal organs, in particular, his heart that was directly under the runes. Within mere moments, the faint outline of a cocoon of threads was visible, wrapped around the runes.Releasing the ritual entirely at this point, Grandma turns her energy towards the strings now encircling the two runes. Using the strings as a point of circulation, the old woman begins to cycle a powerful silencing spell through them, her intention to erase all signs of the rune. Simply channeling such a spell towards him would suppress the runes, but with a conduit for the spell to flow through and focused on a specific area, she aimed to outright destroy the runes.

A palish white, near translucent globe, appeared around the defense rune on Ozrith\u2019s chest. The globe hung there for a long moment, not a single movement coming from it. Then Grandma let out a long sigh as she unleashed all the magical energy she had been building up. A gust of wind rushed through the vault as the palish orb began to rapidly shrink.

As the orb shrunk, the magic of the defense rune was pulled along with it, soon confined in a very small space indeed. Suppressing a cough, Grandma raised her left hand, a snap of her fingers resulting in the pinprick of light to be consumed a pinprick of black, the void.
