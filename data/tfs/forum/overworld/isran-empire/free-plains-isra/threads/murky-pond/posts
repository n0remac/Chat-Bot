He walked up to Helena, tossing her the little carving that he'd been working on and peering past her into the pond. Helena would find a small wooden soldier in her hand, exquisitely carved in her likeness right down to the scars on her face and the braid in her hair.\u00a0\"Are you sure you want to include me in your report?\" he asked. \"Who will believe that you saw a strange masked man who could do things that cannot be done? People will think you're crazy. Or worse, they'll believe you. What then? There may or may not be some people in your department, high up in the guard, who already know me.

Of course, this is all hypothetical. Write your report as you see fit, you good little wooden soldier.\"Picking up a long wooden stick from the ground, he poked at the floating hand, which grabbed at it and pulled him sharply towards the water. Shaking his head, Foxgloves let go of the stick just before his pointy boot touched the pond's edge.\"And what if the very same hypothetical person is the one who ordered your little zombie put in this pond in the first place? I've heard all sorts of rumors, you know. You hear a lot of things if you listen, and people never expect anyone to be listening because they rarely listen themselves. Of course, rumors are rumors, but they all start with a grain of truth. Or so they say. So many rumors circulate about your government, you know. Pretty redheads with pretty eyes.

She pockets it for later, currently unsure on what to do with it, but there is more pressing matters to attend to right now. \"I'll be including you, yes,\" Helena says, eyes narrowed. \"I don't care if you're known or not, or if they believe me, but it's my job to report stuff like dead bodies in off-limits areas and strange beings who don't make sense.

Even though she declares she isn't there to sift through rumours or to, for lack of a better word, think, Foxgloves could no doubt see the spark of intelligence in her eyes, even if she chooses not to show it. Afterall, it's how she gets people to underestimate her. Once Foxgloves steps up, her mind is set, this creature is no man. A chaotic construct? A puppet? A piece of undigested cheese or a blob of mustard, creating a figment of her imagination? No. Foxgloves is\u2026 most likely just Foxgloves. A fluke, a random assortment of natural mistakes. She wouldn't say that, of cours. \"And just like wildfire and disease, they kill all the same,\" she retorts. \"Either the body or the mind, it doesn't matter.

The most she'd done is punch a drunkard who spat in her face, and that was off duty. Most of her work is either breaking up tavern fights and\u2026 ugh. Paperwork. Her delay to think about this would speak volumes to those who would pay attention to such things. Finally, she realises she's been silent for too long. \"I protect the empire and fight all those who would oppose it,\" she says. \"I'm a fighter. Not a scholar or a politician. My sword is my art, and it speaks for me.\" Then she shakes her head. \"Parasites? Mindless rumours, Foxgloves.

Something's up with that water and we need to find out what.\" ---------------------------- Hours layer, Helena finds herself at her dining table in her cozy home, just outside the city. The fire is burning, her blinds are freshly closed, and the day is finally winding down. Her hair is still damp from her after dinner bath, and she wears little more than her house robe and a pair of slippers, finally finding comfort after a long day. Is her long day over though? Unfortunately, no. Sitting on the table is a small book, largely empty for now, a quill and ink, and a half eaten sweet roll. Reports wait for no man, unfortunately, and after today's festivities, it's likely she would be at it for a while. Regardless, she writes her report for the day. Finding the pond, the vials her team found nearby, the questioning of the townsfolk, and the beginning of the murder investigation. The necromancy is looking to be accidental, a combination of discarded, 'failed' potions from the local apothecary, but that's not for her to decide. What IS for her to decide is wether or not to include a certain character in her little screenplay. She leans back in her chair and sighs\u2026. Before shaking her head. \"What are you doing\u2026?\" She whispers to herself. \"Eh\u2026 he's not important to this case.\" It seems Foxgloves is safe for another day. Would she regret omitting Foxgloves from her report? Well, she suspects he just happened to be there, and not an actual suspect.It's not long before she looks over the report and yawns. This is what her life had come to, eh? Her aspirations of climbing up this ladder towards guarding the empress herself\u2026 but from who? She did have a reputation, or at least rumours were persistent about her ravenous lust. Would Helena be guarding her, or her entourage? Her sex cave? She shakes her head loose of those thoughts, they're not appropriate to be thinking about. Focus on the job at hand. Which is boring, she decides, and guarding a hallway in the palace sounds just as boring now that she thinks about it. Yes, there's a pay rise and prestige, but it doesn't mean anything if she doesn't get to use the skills she spent so long building. But is the endless paperwork the way to get there? Is being spat on by drunks and berated by foolish criminals worth it? The only fighting she gets to do is training, and even that's lost its luster. She sits back in her chair and lets one leg swing under the table, her slipper dangling from her toes. At this rate, she would be doing paperwork forever. It's very good quality paperwork, but the only prestige she'd earn this way is with the clerks who would be filing it for nobody to ever see again once the case is closed. She looks up to the plain plaster ceiling above her and sighs. Surely there's more? Something better for her skills? If only she had a sign\u2026 ", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"Not for life,\" Helena interjects when Foxgloves mentions her arresting folks. \"And if it IS for life, they deserve it.\" She expects that to fall on deaf ears though, Foxgloves seemed to be on a roll. \"And I don't follow any of those beliefs.
