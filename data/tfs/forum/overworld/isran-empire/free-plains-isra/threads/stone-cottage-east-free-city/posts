After his fight with the Loa, he thought it would be prudent to conserve his energy a bit. As he walked he dished out an introductory lesson on metamagics to his (mostly) unwilling new students. Their groans and dead eyes were completely missed, as Hirhan was engrossed by his lecture. \"So, there are four main schools of magic, according to the Archmage Jeakuo III. First there is evocation, the most commonly used school. This is the purview of battlemages, spellswords, and other such unenlightened brutes. Their philosophy is thus: that magic is to be channeled unpresisely, in large amounts. Think of them like a waterfall surging with power... but utterly at the whim of the contours of the land.\"He adjusted his glasses.\"Next comes cantrips. Like evocation, cantrips are supposed to be cast quickly, though they differ in that they tend to be more complex, and that they consume less energy. If evocation is a waterfall, cantrips are a pipe with a valve on the end: more focused, but still capable of instantaneous surges of power.\"His lesson was cut short when he sighted the cottage around the bend. \"Oh, we are here!

Again though, I did not see what it was until it was too late.\" He was directly talking to Rani by this point. \"I am really sorry. I would have sent you to seal it up somewhere so it couldn't roam, instead of slaying it. If I new it was Nati Loa...\" The sage's voice trailed off in sorrow for moment. He stood slowly and motioned to a wall. A small armory was there. \"These are your rewards. I gave Leiron his already because I couldn't get it inside. A blade for Max, a shield and chain mail hauberk for Ralf. A magical vambrace for Hirhan. For Asadobres, a piece of draconic armor, sadly not a full set... And for you Rani, a gauntlet.\" Max's sword was a typical longsword by design but the guard, pummel and blade where all hewn from one piece of steel. Black leather coated the grip. The blade was balanced slightly toward the blade for stronger but slightly less controlled hits. The steel shone with the same white gold shine as leiron's spear. Ralf's Shield was a round shield like the one he currently has. However the shield like all the trinkets the Sage was offering had a white gold shine to it. It however had etched into its face a wolf snarling. \"Sure to intimidate foes.\" The edges of the shield had runes in it that had no power, their purpose unknown save perhaps to Hirhan and his funny glasses. The chainmail was of the same material, \"To replace what was destroyed...\" Hirhan's Vambrace was mostly of the same material as the others. it was a metal plat that sat upon the top of either forearm. However the mythrill only outlined the heart of the vambrace. The heart was made of obsidian, strange curving geometric patterns wove through it and in the center a diamond like gem. \"This is special. This device, it in itself is completely immune to magic. The gem in its center absorbs the spell structure, and part of the energy of the spell... and recast it. This includes your own spells. The gem will change color acccording to the type of magic used. Do try to hide it under a sleeve or something, the gem is sure to attract bandits that spot it. Rani's gauntlet was as the others a white gold looking material. The gaunlet looked like it was made of feathers. The first 2 didgits of each finger was left un armored. The back of the hand had a red jewel, The forearm of the gauntlet looked like it was make of metal feathers. The gem allowed better control of the fire element. Asadrobes draconic armor was a chest plate. The metal like the other artifacts were white gold in color. the plate had a central plate and several plates that would fold out or collapse in based on movement. It was for a young dragon, designed to be grown into. The armor would fit Asadobres for sometime. The sage had adjusted the straps on the armor so it fit would fit Asadobres perfectly one she was equipped in it.  After the sage had handed out the rewards he began to speak. \"You killed a God. This was not what I thought I was sending you to do. But you, mortals, have slew a god. I rewarded you accordingly. Everyone of these items are made of Mythril. This material can only be forged by dwarves and altered by magic. Not one of these items holds the original shape the dwarves gave it. But all are true to purpose. These weapons cannot be broken, pierced, or destroyed unless struck by another weapon of mythril, or pitted by magic.\" He stopped talking and turn his back to the group.
