This was not the Spindle he had been raised in, however, it still displayed whispers of the past he had known. The turnip fields were full of withered tops, the cursed soil barely supporting the growth. Rafe seemed to remember the turnip tops having more green when he was younger, not the sickly black-grey currently wilting in the sun, covered by dust. Dilapidated fences, weathered and grey, separated the fields from their neighbors, but were unnecessary in keeping out the livestock. Not even the few pigs would touch the tops, leaving the fields untouched by scavenging animals. Rafe strode down the dusty road, his clothing as grey as the fence, as tattered as the fences, and as nondescript as the houses and shacks. The evening sun cast shadows that played across the road, shadows that Rafe seemed to float across. Any bystanders would almost say that Rafe became shadow as the darkness flowed. Approaching the ruins of a shack at the end of the village, Rafe slowed. This was the first time in nearly 20 years that he had seen his childhood home. The fence around the property was only evident in the posts left behind, all other portions had been taken by the neighbors to repair their own fences. The roof had collapsed, and anything of value had long since been taken and sold. The conditions of the village made Rafe recall his experiences over the past quarter century. He remembered picking his first pocket when a group of travelers had made a short stop to rest their horses. He had left the village to seek a living in a larger populace at age 12, turning his back on his family and friends. The past ten years had been spent in and out of labor-intensive sentences, punishment for the cons, thefts, and crimes committed. Whips cracking, chains rattling, and the disdain all the prisoners felt for each other had developed a pessimistic outlook, which Rafe then focused on the drab world around him. He had only returned to Spindle to bide his time and determine the direction he intended to take next in life. This may have been a mistake.

It seemed that even in such a harsh environment, there was still a place for some joy. As the children stood up and began singing again, Rafe would feel a prod on his back. An ancient, wrinkled crone stood behind him, raising the cane with which she'd just poked him.\u00a0\"I know you,\" she croaked. \"Don't tell me...you're little Rafe, aren't you? The boy who was always getting into trouble? I recognize those sneaky eyes anywhere. I thought you'd died, or left for good. What brings you back to this little slice of hell, boy?\"Rafe would recognize her as Old Missus Bitters, an old spinster who had always terrorized the children when he was young. It had seemed at times that she had nothing better to do than shake her fist and shout at little ones as they ran through her yard, and many a young lad had felt the smack of her walking stick. She'd been old back then, and seemed positively fossilized now. It was anyone's guess as to how she wasn't dead yet.

No, he was born after you left...good boy. Nice young lad, and very strong, too. He didn't leave like the others, he wanted to do everything he could to keep this town going...poor boy. He got locked up by the authorities, you know. Imperial guards. All he wanted to do was to get something worth some money...he tried to sneak into the Estate. I don't know why the Isran Guard cares so much about the place to guard it, it doesn't belong to them...but they caught him sneaking out. Do you know what they caught him with? A dozen silver spoons. For a dozen silver spoons, they beat him and took him to the city to be thrown in a dungeon. All because he wanted to help the village.\"Shaking her head, she gestured with her cane towards the south. Rafe would recall that the old Bitterglass Estate was off in that direction, although it had been closed off as long as anyone could remember.\"I lived there as a little girl, you know. It was my Uncle's...before the accident. Everything in there should belong to me, but then the guards came and told us that it was closed off, that nobody was allowed inside, and that the whole place belonged to the government. I remember the chandelier that hung in the dining room. It was beautiful, held sixty candles...and it was covered in perfect diamonds. If someone could bring that back, we could turn this village around...but the guards seized it and closed the gates.

Some tales may be true, but I may have forgotten. I might recall something as a truth, when in fact it was merely imagination. Who can say? What is a fact, but a tale that many people believe to be true? I do remember the chandelier though, I remember that as clear as I'm seeing your face right now. That chandelier...well, to a little girl, it was the thing of dreams. I felt like royalty eating my dinner under that chandelier. The way it glittered and sparkled and shone...yes, I remember that clearly. Everything else, though...gosh, I don't recall much at all. Especially the accident...it was all such a rush, such a blur. He told us we had to go, had to leave, that he'd follow us after he finished something...and then the guards were there, blocking the gate, telling us that nobody would ever be allowed back in there.

I spent all my time playing outside, on the grounds or in the forest. I was so young, back then. Why go inside, anyways? It was cold inside, always so cold, and my uncle said that I was never to go upstairs. Tanned my hide when I so much as set a toe on the first step.
