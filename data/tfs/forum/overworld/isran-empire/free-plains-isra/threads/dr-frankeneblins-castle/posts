Then, after adjusting to the smell and figuring that Harn wasn't going anywhere soon, Oddic set about cleaning up the room. All the scrap bits were piled in a corner, in case he might need some miscellaneous thing later. The dust was easy enough to wipe away as well, but it consumed a lot of time and when it was finished he heard a bell faintly toll from above. He wondered at that, until the smells of feast wafted down to him. He was a little curious as to how he could smell it through the walls and stench of death, but this place was obviously owned by someone well versed in magic, so he left it at that.If Oddic was going to be getting some food, he probably would have to dispose of Harn first. Righting the desk, he clambered onto it and came face to face with his predecessor. \"What could have been so horrible that you just gave up on living?\" The bloated corpse stared silently back, giving no hints as to its secrets.Upon inspection of the knot at the top, he saw that it was tied very shoddily. After a few pulls in the right places, Harn's lifeless body fell to the floor with a thud. And a little bit of a squish, as well. Oddic hopped off the desk and grabbed Harn under his arms, and started to drag the corpse towards the stairs. The wolves either recognized Oddic from his first time through, or simply didn't care for rotting meat. They didn't challenge him as he went through their territory. They didn't even growl. They just watched him as he struggled to slide Harn across the flagstone floor.Finally, he made it to the steps. After the ordeal he had, he knew he wasn't going to make it up with Harn in tow. After sitting and thinking for a few minutes, an idea popped into his head. He dashed back to his room, and grabbed the desk. After carrying it back the the stairwell, he flipped it upside down and placed it on the floor like that. Harn was dragged to the desk, and arranged so his limbs all were propped against its legs. That way when it tilted, the body would stay in place.Oddic then loosened the noose around Harn's neck to take it off, and tied the rope to the two desk legs closest to the stairs. He made sure that it was a good knot, so it wouldn't come undone halfway up. As another precaution, he tried breaking the legs off. They held, so he hoped that meant they'd be able to handle what came next. But first, he needed some help. Not wanting to head upstairs empty handed, he went searching in the halls past his room. He doubted that any Wolf Knights would help, considering this was supposed to be a first test of sorts.Maybe he'd find one of those goblin-things, or another guest of the Doctor.

From my brief experimentation with it, the more souls you put in a single body, the more unstable it becomes. Not a particularly surprising finding, but I suspect with enough testing you could find a way to stabilize the process. There\u2019s a great deal to be gained if you could stabilize the process as the having the experiences of multiple entities in just one body\u2026 Well, it\u2019s rather obvious why such a thing could be beneficial.\u201d<br/><br/>The reaction of the gnome put Grandma at ease with her choice. There were many skillful mages she knew in Isra but finding one of them who would be willing to work on something like this had been quite difficult. Dr. Frankeneblin was quick on his way to surpassing the expectations she initially held when looking for someone to operate this ritual.<br/><br/>\u201cI\u2019m very glad to hear you have such a positive outlook on the ritual. I must admit, it\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve seen someone as dedicated to their work as you are to yours.
