Nestled within sight of the Norkari Mountains was a modest house, constructed of wood and brick and overlooking a vast expanse of grazing land, dotted with stables for the most exotic of creatures.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Like any good ranch, it had its fair share of horses, the animals being relatively easy to obtain and breed, the techniques for doing so having been perfected by the sentient races of the world over millennia of coexisting together. The horses come in a variety of colors and sizes, but the most predominant of them all is the warhorse, Liz specializing in training mounts for fighting purposes. These horses will not even back down when faced with the vaunted griffins of the Dawn Riders, becoming accustomed to them at a very young age.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The next most populous animal on the Ranch is a couple of packs of dire wolves, a couple of breeding pairs being gifted to the young woman by her father. They function both as mounts and protection for the various mundane animals that exist on the ranch, such as sheep, cows, and pigs, protecting them from wild predators and even driving off the occasional wild griffin coming down from the mountains. They are usually friendly to visitors accompanied by the few people who work the ranch, but to unaccompanied strangers, they are quite ferocious. The building attached to the Ranchhouse houses their young and is a constant cacophony of yips, squeals, barks, and growls.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Griffins constitute the next group of animals bred at the ranch, Liz having traveled into the Norkari Mountains to find an abandoned nest and raise the orphaned hatchlings herself. A short, but wide, stone tower houses the eyries, providing plenty of space for the griffins. It is also an excellent retirement home for old griffins, and she takes in those griffins whose Riders have fallen in battle, giving them a safe home where she can use them to train the next generation of griffin young.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Another stone tower, not far from the griffins', provides a home for the Ranch's two wyverns, recently received as a gift from the Land-Tiller's State. They have just conceived a clutch of eggs, and any who come close, save for Liz herself, are driven off by the fierce parental instincts of the wyverns.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Much more open land remains to be purposed on the ranch, and Liz is constantly on the lookout for any mentions of animals she could add to The Ranch, her own griffin, St. George, often accompanying her on the excursions to acquire such creatures.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://imgur.com/bNqzYkV.jpg", "http://imgur.com/g9Kl2Js.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://imgur.com/bNqzYkV.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/></div>"}, "post-71976": {"user": "Aeris Volknir", "user_num": 2468, "timestamp": "1503480507000", "message": "A small party wandered into the ranch.

Lamina may be able to make guesses based on their route as they ride through the city, but they would soon leave Isra by way of the North Gate, riding the road toward the Norkari Mountains.Naoki passes the time with light conversation, making inquiries toward what Lamina thinks of things since she\u2019s come to Isra. What she thinks of Alden, the work she\u2019s done, her favorite things to eat, and so on. Smoothly in the course of the conversation, Naoki reveals that she had sandwiches prepared and hidden in the carriage earlier, and shares these with both Lamina and the carriage attendants.Then they would turn off the main road and slow down as they start down what must be either a very rough road or an arbitrary line drawn across the plains. Whatever the case, it was not intended for carriages, and the ride is a bit bumpier than anyone would reasonably prefer. Luckily, it isn\u2019t long before the carriage rolls to a stop. Evidently, their stop, as Naoki moves to exit. She steps down into the grass and takes a moment to stretch before beginning to examine their surroundings. This is the first time she\u2019s visited.\u201cDo you know where we are?\u201d she asks Lamina. Naoki makes no indication of an intention to go even so much as another step forward.

I first saw them when I was on patrol and was sent to find you as soon as possible. I only saw the attack on the tower because I passed by to get a new horse. But while I was there I heard the orcs terrible war chant. I grew up in the mountains and know a bit of their language you see. The orcs roared the name of a dragon, who they must have fought for. In fact, I saw a dragon painted onto the shield of the one I killed. But that was later. The name they chanted was Jardor, or something like that. I couldn\u2019t hear them properly from such a distance.\u201d Asger didn\u2019t know very much about dragons except for a story he had heard when stationed by Goraia. Before the war started there three dragons had fought on the border. Asger couldn\u2019t quite remember the names of the beasts, but one had been named something like that. Asger couldn\u2019t stop speaking yet. In order to have any chance of being believed he had to come up with a story that was so detailed that no one could think he had made it up, \u201cWell, a group of the orcs followed me. I could have fought them of course,\u201d There was an Isrian issue spear on his back, \u201cBut I knew I had to get to you as soon as possible. I decided it was best to try and outrun the orcs. They ran my first horse to death on account as I couldn\u2019t switch him at the border. I had a good lead and stayed ahead on foot. I've never run so fast and far in my life. Recon that was a new record. I came across the main road just as the orcs caught up to me. Luckily, these fine travelers jumped in to help me, \u2018cause I was quite tired by then. We killed the three orcs and that\u2019s when I saw the dragon painted on the shield. In case there were more coming, these good samaritans escorted me the rest of the way here.\u2018That\u2019s about it, except that, when I was on patrol we went through a village that had reported sightings of a dragon.
