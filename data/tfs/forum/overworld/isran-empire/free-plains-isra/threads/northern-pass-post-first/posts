The Cave became engulfed with lava, melting his entire hoard and mixing it in with the sea of lava. Fundor took flight as the quaking continued, the inner cave beginning to collapse as he flew up towards the surface as the mountain began to destabilize, the resulting earthquakes felt as far as Isra by now.

He left behind him a gaping hole in the top of the mountain that began to collapse inwards even as the lava within the core of the mountain rose and built up pressure. A great plume of smoke already was billowing out of the top of the mountain now turned volcano.\u00a0Fundor channeled more magic now, building up the pressure within the volcano more and more, pushing it further towards eruption. Numerous vines of the Wyld also burrowed throughout the rock, destabilizing the mountain further. From Isra, one would be able to look into the distant Norkari mountain range and see the huge billowing smoke rising from one the mountaintop, signaling an impending massive eruption...Just as Ulfang is about to formulate a witty reply, the ground begins to shift tremulously, a small shudder growing into a violent rumbling that shakes one's teeth. Rocks begin to fall from the mountains, but the skeletal dragons are quick to bat them away with their spaded tails, putting themselves between the falling boulders and Ulfang's army.\"Ah, guardsman!\" he calls up, shouting over the tremor and pointing toward the billowing smoke belching up from the Norkari Mountains.\"I don't suppose that's just a very large signal fire of yours, is it?

The dragon's scales and insides are of such a high temperature that the vines would find themselves searing upon touching him or burrowing in, yet still, they held fast. The dark words flashing in his mind only angered him more, though his struggling slowed as his limbs numbed...<br><br/>Then suddenly, a jolt of power courses through him, enough power to make even a dragon as strong as Fundor foam at the mouth, craving more. Suddenly he was one with the Wyld and he could see, hear and feel everything... He wasn't completely subjugated yet, however...<br/><br/>\"You know not who you grant such power to, I will destroy Isra... Burn its Empress to\u00a0ashes. Then I will come for you.\"<br/><br/>Fundor released the vines from himself now, channeling his new found magical power granted to him from the wyld\u00a0along with the power of the mountain. Immediately the ground started quaking beneath him, the entire mountain and surrounding mountain range stirring, causing avalanches to begin to fall down the Norkari mountain slopes. Beneath Fundor's\u00a0clawed feet, deep in that mountain, the sea of gold beneath him began to glow red hot as the rising lava from deep within the Overworld's mantle began to rise.\u00a0<br/><br/>\"<b>lleisgar ixen tonash, shartleg nomeno verthicha sari vi jennu charirfla ekess ixen!</b>\"<br/><br/>Fundor roared the words, his voice projecting for miles, amplified by the firey magic he channeled. The Cave became engulfed with lava, melting his entire hoard and mixing it in with the sea of lava. Fundor took flight as the quaking continued, the inner cave beginning to collapse as he flew up towards the surface as the mountain began to destabilize, the resulting earthquakes felt as far as Isra by now. His wings and body began to glow with a red aura as he barreled\u00a0towards the top of the mountain and the entrance to his cavern, streaking through the collapsing tunnel like a flaming meteor falling upwards.\u00a0<br/><br/>The cavern\u00a0completely collapsed before he reached the exit, leaving a few suspenseful\u00a0moments of tranquility at the snow-covered\u00a0the top of Cloud Spear Mountain before the gigantic dragon burst through the rock, flying upwards into the sky with a great roar. He left behind him a gaping hole in the top of the mountain that began to collapse inwards even as the lava within the core of the mountain rose and built up pressure. A great plume of smoke already was billowing out of the top of the mountain now turned volcano.\u00a0<br/><br/>Fundor channeled more magic now, building up the pressure within the volcano more and more, pushing it further towards eruption. Numerous vines of the Wyld also burrowed throughout the rock, destabilizing the mountain further. <br/><br/>From Isra, one would be able to look into the distant Norkari mountain range and see the huge billowing smoke rising from one the mountaintop, signaling an impending massive eruption...<br/><br/><br/><div class=\"quote_clear\"></div></br></div></div>"}, "post-81985": {"user": "Tyrell", "user_num": 2432, "timestamp": "1524270211000", "message": "Ulfang wouldn\u2019t be left waiting too long.

It hadn\u2019t helped that they had been told rumours of all sorts of beasties that had made their homes around here. Rumours, surely. \u201cWhat a bloody carry on,\u201d Simon Telmont, a lowly halbredeer, assigned to sit on the carriage, murmurs as he dismounts his iron throne. \u201cWhy do they send us out here in the dead of night?

No idea, mate, but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m about to go askin\u2019.\u201d \u201cYeah, right,\u201d Simon grunts as he sticks his weapon into the dirt and makes his way to the growing fire, intent to get some grub. \u201cCan\u2019t wait to get home\u2026\u201d He settles onto a fallen log nearby and waits for the crew to begin cooking up their lunch.

He rubs his eyes and squints, surely\u2026 \u201c...what are we looking at?\u201d the other guard asks, holding a chicken leg in hand, fresh off the fire. \u201cMountains.

The group stop and listen\u2026 on the night air, now laid silent by the demented howl, a slow, methodical sound. Something that sounds like the wings of a bat, but slower. It started to grow louder and louder before the veteran\u2019s eyes bulge and he cries out, \u201cGet to cover!\u201d The group begins to scatter, and just in time, as the road ahead is bathed a stream of fire that engulfs two abandoned horses, cooking them and killing them instantly. Cries emerge from the men as they scatter in a panic, each pointing at the huge creature that flies overhead, but are soon drowned out by the tremendous, deep howl that emanates from it. The road behind them is bathed in another jet of flame, trapping the guards between walls of fire, a mountain, and a sheer cliff face. There would be no escape. \u201cFire everything!\u201d the veteran calls as he collects himself, drawing his blade as his subordinates produce their crossbows. As the creature lands, bolts begin flying through the air, straight towards the beast, but they harmlessly plink off of the thick scales that coated its hide. As the creature approaches the flames, it becomes clear as day. A tremendous dragon, its spine covered in spikes, and its scales green as the forest. Its long tail flicks out and bats away three men running towards it, battleaxes drawn, and sends them careening into the trees that surrounded them. Pathetic\u2026 Simon stands frozen, staring up at the creature, halberd shaking in his hands. The green scales, the huge teeth and massive claws, the golden patches\u2026 wait, golden patches? His eyes are drawn towards the patches of melted gold that coated parts of the creature\u2019s hide where scales should have been. Perhaps a weakness? Would he be able to find out. \u201cFoolish mortals!\u201d the dragon bellows before releasing a torrent of fire into the air. More bolts plink off of his scales before landing uselessly on the ground. \u201cI have no interest in your tiny little lives,\u201d it continues, turning its huge head towards the crossbow men. It opens its maw and lets the fire build deep in its throat, which is enough warning for the men to drop their weapons and flee into the trees. \u201cSurrender your gold!\u201d The dragon demands, flicking its tail out and crushing the base of a nearby tree. \u201cAnd I may let you go with your lives! Defy me\u2026\u201d It spots Simon and leans down close to the little man. It reaches out and plucks the halberd from his shaking hands between two claws, and snaps it in half like its nothing. \u201cAnd I will feast on your bones.\u201d The veteran holds out his hand to his men, telling them to hold. \u201cVile creature\u2026\u201d The bearded fellow calls out from his spot amongst his men. \u201cWe are guards of Isra! We do not surrender so-\u201d \u201cSo be it,\u201d the creature rumbles, interrupting the veteran. \u201cI gave you mercy. You asked for death!\u201d With that, he lets out a plume of fire straight into the forest, sending several guards scattering, screaming for mercy and their mothers, much to the dragon\u2019s disappointment. No adversary has given him a challenge since the dwarves of old. Pitiful. As more bolts fly out towards him, he takes off, flapping his incredible wings and taking to the sky. He circles twice before turning his flame on three horses that try to escape, turning two to ash and sending the last, with its rider, careening to the ground. The veteran who was mounted, fleeing from the fight, rolls several times before coming to a stop against a rock, twisting his leg in a way that it shouldn\u2019t be twisted. The dragon lands beside him, grinning as he lumbers forward, shaking the ground with each step. \u201cPathetic,\u201d he rumbles, getting nice and close. \u201cI will let you live, coward. You will live to tell them all of your cowardice. You sentenced your men to death\u2026 then you run. Pitiful.\u201d Before the veteran can say another word, however, the dragon takes off, releasing another plume of fire into the trees, burning anyone still stupid enough to try hiding. It turns and heads straight for the carriage, which had long since been abandoned in the panic, and perches atop it. Its claws cleave into the iron housing, and with a mighty flap, it lifts the heavily laden carriage up into the sky. The creature swoops one more time, this time picking up one of the horses that had been cooked in his initial support with his exceptional maw, and flies off into the night, carriage in tow. The panicked guards drag their injured companions away from the burning fires, or run to and fro, yelling at each other, demanding instructions from whoever they could get their hands on. Simon merely stands where he had before, unable to speak, and unable to move, his face as pale as a ghost as he watches the dragon, and their charge, fly into the moonlight, then disappear into the mountain with a distant roar. He just wanted to go home. ", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The cold mountain air is thick with mist as the royal tax collectors make their way down the mountains.

Consul Finch rode up to the now scorched Northern Gatehouse, St. George the Griffin as magnificent as ever. Her shield hung at her back, and behind it were about 30 of the Citadel's own Company of Dawn Riders, riding in a loose formation and keeping an eager eye out for the Dragon. Another small group, on the ground and not in the air, played escort to a pair of heavy covered wagons.\u00a0Liz rode about a hundred feet in front of her escort, and looked at the devastation that had been wrought less than a day before. Such an absolute shame. Of all the entrances to the Free Plains, she was fairly certain this was the one that got trashed the most. Such things could be rebuilt, though, she thought, stopping right about where the border was.She shouted out, \"Does the dragon who so thoroughly dismantled our Northern border still lurk nearby, or has he left? We come to talk, in spite of the egregious and violent acts inflicted by you. There is much we have to offer one another, if we can act civilized.\" Besides a lance mounted in a hard to reach spot on St. George's flank, and her escort still about 100ft back, Liz was unarmed in the spirit of what she wished to accomplish.\u00a0", "link_list": ["/post/94840/thread", "/user/3665"], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/VfFkCBB.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@grundesdyg\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/94840/thread\" timestamp=\"1579833835\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-3665\" title=\"Grundesdyg, Scourge of Dwarves\"><img alt=\"Grundesdyg, Scourge of Dwarves Avatar\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/VfFkCBB.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/94840/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1579833835000\" title=\"Jan 23, 2020 18:43:55 GMT -8\">Jan 23, 2020 18:43:55 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-3665 group-0\" href=\"/user/3665\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@grundesdyg\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Grundesdyg, Scourge of Dwarves</span></a></span> said:</div>The cold mountain air is thick with mist as the royal tax collectors make their way down the mountains.

It opens its maw and lets the fire build deep in its throat, which is enough warning for the men to drop their weapons and flee into the trees. <br/><br/>\u201cSurrender your gold!\u201d The dragon demands, flicking its tail out and crushing the base of a nearby tree. \u201cAnd I may let you go with your lives! Defy me\u2026\u201d It spots Simon and leans down close to the little man. It reaches out and plucks the halberd from his shaking hands between two claws, and snaps it in half like its nothing. \u201cAnd I will feast on your bones.\u201d <br/><br/>The veteran holds out his hand to his men, telling them to hold. \u201cVile creature\u2026\u201d The bearded fellow calls out from his spot amongst his men. \u201cWe are guards of Isra! We do not surrender so-\u201d <br/><br/>\u201cSo be it,\u201d the creature rumbles, interrupting the veteran. \u201cI gave you mercy. You asked for death!\u201d With that, he lets out a plume of fire straight into the forest, sending several guards scattering, screaming for mercy and their mothers, much to the dragon\u2019s disappointment. No adversary has given him a challenge since the dwarves of old. Pitiful. <br/><br/>As more bolts fly out towards him, he takes off, flapping his incredible wings and taking to the sky. He circles twice before turning his flame on three horses that try to escape, turning two to ash and sending the last, with its rider, careening to the ground. The veteran who was mounted, fleeing from the fight, rolls several times before coming to a stop against a rock, twisting his leg in a way that it shouldn\u2019t be twisted. <br/><br/>The dragon lands beside him, grinning as he lumbers forward, shaking the ground with each step. \u201cPathetic,\u201d he rumbles, getting nice and close. \u201cI will let you live, coward. You will live to tell them all of your cowardice. You sentenced your men to death\u2026 then you run. Pitiful.\u201d Before the veteran can say another word, however, the dragon takes off, releasing another plume of fire into the trees, burning anyone still stupid enough to try hiding. <br/><br/>It turns and heads straight for the carriage, which had long since been abandoned in the panic, and perches atop it. Its claws cleave into the iron housing, and with a mighty flap, it lifts the heavily laden carriage up into the sky. The creature swoops one more time, this time picking up one of the horses that had been cooked in his initial support with his exceptional maw, and flies off into the night, carriage in tow. <br/><br/>The panicked guards drag their injured companions away from the burning fires, or run to and fro, yelling at each other, demanding instructions from whoever they could get their hands on. <br/><br/>Simon merely stands where he had before, unable to speak, and unable to move, his face as pale as a ghost as he watches the dragon, and their charge, fly into the moonlight, then disappear into the mountain with a distant roar. <br/><br/>He just wanted to go home. <br/><div class=\"quote_clear\"></div></br></div></div>"}, "post-95172": {"user": "Places to Go, People to Meet.", "user_num": 3651, "timestamp": "1580798036000", "message": "The Dawn Rider\u2019s demand is met with\u2026 silence. The air hangs around them with nothing more than a mid-winter chill and the howling of the wind through the peaks beyond the border, and certainly no dragons.\u201cYou won\u2019t find a blood dragon like that!\u201d an old woman\u2019s voice calls out from the treeline. A little old lady, sitting on the back of a generally disinterested donkey, plods from the trees, carrying a basket of freshly picked mushrooms. Only the edible kind, of course, she\u2019s not up to anything nefarious. \u201cAnd its about bloody time you lot showed up! Scaley bastard has the whole range quaking in their wee boots! Not me though!\u201d The tiny woman seems unimpressed by the griffin riders, and seems more concerned about her mushrooms as she places a cloth over them, as if it would protect them from the slightly ashy air. \u201cGallivanting about the borders, yelling into the air, people might mistake ya for a looney they would!\u201d she continues as she stops just ten feet away from the woman. \u201cOr maybe ya think you\u2019re just that self important! Pah! Royalty!\u201d The grumpy woman scowls, her almost toothless maw pulled into a long frown. \u201cBut I suppose we should be thankful you lot are doin\u2019 something, considering how much we pay in taxes. RIGHT!\u201d She turns the donkey around and points to one of the peaks, not a far flight at all for griffin riders, but a few hours at best for those on horses, galloping at that. \u201cFolks say \u2018e flew off over yonder, and they be the types I trust, unlike yourselves. Probably into one o\u2019 them cavey-ruin things. The ones we tell the children not t\u2019 bother with. Dangerous places them, could collapse at any moment.\u201d She gives the procession another look over before huffing. \u201cPah.\u201d With that, she starts plodding off down the road for home. \u201cThose dwarves couldn\u2019t build a home to save their life! No wonder they\u2019re all gone!\u201d her mumbling rambles, mostly about fancy pants Isran types and mushrooms, only continue as she continues along the road at a speed most people could probably exceed at a leisurely pace.
