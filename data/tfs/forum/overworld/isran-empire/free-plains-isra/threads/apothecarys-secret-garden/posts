Alystin, however, definitely saw it. Her eyes widened when she saw his fully human form, and she felt heat surge into her face; thankfully, her dark skin made it far less apparent that she was blushing than it would have for someone who wasn't a Drow.

The little girl blinked up at him, looking confused, then struggled onto her feet and toddled back over to him. Her little hand reached up and, as she stretched onto her toes, she patted his cheek. <i>\"Hi? Kiki go?\"</i> Alystin snorted a soft laugh, which was half-stifled behind her hands as she shifted them. Then she lowered them with a clearing of the throat, and, feeling sure she wouldn't make a fool of herself, looked back at him. <font color=\"00B7EB\">\"Thank you for being so understanding and gentle with her.

The notion that she might have any sort of sex appeal was completely foreign to her. Zek had called her pint-sized, annoying, bookish, scrawny, and unlucky.. he might have called her cute. Once. In four years of knowing each other. That the gorgeous man atop her found her sexy hadn't even entered her mind. How could it, when he was so otherworldly and inhuman in his own beautiful yet masculine way? He was a world above her in terms of attractiveness, and she felt grateful simply for the fact that he was interested in her. Which is why when he growled again, and she shifted restlessly beneath him, she was astounded to feel the proof of his attraction to her pressing into her body, a fact which made her gasp.Then she was gazing up at him wide-eyed as his fingers snared themselves within the snowy fall of her hair and tilted her head back, gently yet insistently. Before she could formulate a response, he was kissing her again, with a fire that seared her soul and set her blood to simmering within her veins. A muffled exhalation that was most certainly a needy groan was lost within the tangle of lips and tongues as he plundered her mouth, claiming it in a blatant display of dominance. His conquest sent a bolt of arousal straight through her as she clung to him, her nails unknowingly pressing into the flesh of his lower back, while the hand which was nestled within his hair curled, gently skritching across his scalp.It had been so long since she'd felt anything like this.. even Zekoj hadn't been able to elicit such a response from her. And the brutish Drow man who'd been her only lover was the last thing on her mind now; it was all focused on the building tension nestled low in her belly, and the taste of the man above her, the feel of his skin below her hands and the heat of his body against her, and the undeniable testament to his desire that pressed insistently into her. Her passion rose, and she could admit it: She wanted him, yearned for him to take her on this grass in the soft light of a morning barely begun.. and it scared her. But she wanted it. But fear. Argh.

The notion that she might have any sort of sex appeal was completely foreign to her. Zek had called her pint-sized, annoying, bookish, scrawny, and unlucky.. he <i>might</i> have called her cute. Once. In four years of knowing each other. That the gorgeous man atop her found her sexy hadn't even entered her mind. How could it, when he was so otherworldly and inhuman in his own beautiful yet masculine way? He was a world above her in terms of attractiveness, and she felt grateful simply for the fact that he was interested in her. Which is why when he growled again, and she shifted restlessly beneath him, she was astounded to feel the proof of his attraction to her pressing into her body, a fact which made her gasp.<br><br/>Then she was gazing up at him wide-eyed as his fingers snared themselves within the snowy fall of her hair and tilted her head back, gently yet insistently. Before she could formulate a response, he was kissing her again, with a fire that seared her soul and set her blood to simmering within her veins. A muffled exhalation that was most <i>certainly</i> a needy groan was lost within the tangle of lips and tongues as he plundered her mouth, claiming it in a blatant display of dominance. His conquest sent a bolt of arousal straight through her as she clung to him, her nails unknowingly pressing into the flesh of his lower back, while the hand which was nestled within his hair curled, gently skritching across his scalp.<br/><br/>It had been <i>so long</i> since she'd felt anything like this.. even Zekoj hadn't been able to elicit such a response from her.
