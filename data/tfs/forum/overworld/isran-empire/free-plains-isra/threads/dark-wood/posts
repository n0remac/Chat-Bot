She then knelt next to the girl in front of her, looking her up and down, trying to find the source of the wound. \"Poison? You drank poison?\" she asked. The woman sighed. Poison was no easy task to fix! But it was well within her ability. There is something she noticed... there was a wound, with a strange substance surrounding it. This wasn't poison! Ah! Not an ingestible poison, but a toxin!\"Do not be alarmed. I am here to help you, but it will be strange,\" she told the girl, laying her on her side- just in case the whole ordeal ended up causing her to vomit. It would be bad if she were on her back and it caused her to suffocate.Then, the elven woman placed a hand on her wound and closed her eyes.At first, both elves would see nothing, just the blackness of their eyelids. Then, if the elven warrior so permitted it, a flash of light lit up in their heads.They were in a tunnel large enough for them to stand atop each other's shoulders comfortably. All around them were what seemed to be bubbles encasing small motes of fire. They floated through this tunnel, passing them by. Yuzana looked around, narrowing her eyes as she searched and searched through the tunnel. It was then that she noticed that some of the fire within these little cases were now black and causing them to stick together, blocking the tunnel.\"This is a very bad toxin. You should be happy I found you when I did! Though, there is so much of this blood that is now useless. I will have to expel it with the poison. Forgive me. I cannot lend you any of mine, but I can replenish the metal within your body so healing will not be so tiresome.\"The onlooker would not see the light show, but he would witness the toxins leaking out of the wound, along with the jelly that had once been the girl's blood plopping onto the dirt below. That was how it killed, by making it impassable through the body and heart, as many toxins did. Some fresh blood dripped out at the end, just to make sure all of the toxins had been flushed out.Right after, Yuzana used her other hand to retrieve a spool of thread from her bag. She cut off a piece with the nail on her thumb and thread it through the girl's wound without using a needle, making small holes in her skin by stretching her pores. When she pulled the wound closed with the string, she put her hand over the girl's heart and searched for the stores of ore within her own body, but the girl had not had time to replenish her motes of blood, and thus had no open stores for the substances.With a sigh, the lightshow around them vanished, and Yuzana pulled away from the girl and opened her eyes. It was likely that the warrior would feel drained and tired, but any delirium caused by the toxins would have cleared up through the process.\"How do you feel? I Was able to expel the venom and seal the wound. I did not detect any other ails, so if you have any others, please let me know.\"Thoug she didn't show it, she had used quite a lot of energy to push out that amount of venom and the affected bodyparts through the wound.

How could that be, something so small could not exist could it?\". The old mage had chomped at the bit , this elf would prove far more useful than he'd guessed, there was no sense in chancing it by dealing with the other oddity. Slowly, as if molding clay by feel alone, the mage began to shape a spell around the bard... A spell that slowly but steadily made the bard \"not noticed\" either missing or there... And lost... She'd soon wander off her own direction. However if she proved to be too stubborn, Solus had other --- more active --- ways of dealing with the likes of her.
