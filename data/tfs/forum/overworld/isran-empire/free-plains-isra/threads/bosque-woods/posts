Now and again, when Amairgen was, she took it upon herself to familiarize with the area.That particular day, the witch carried quite a few empty jars with her. A spotted black-and-white dog followed happily, several jars strapped onto a harness that was firmly attached to his back. They trekked through the thickest of the bushes and trees, swatting away branches here and there until a familiar humming filled her ears. Smiling, the pale woman urged forward, keeping her eyes on the canopy. She stopped only when the source of the humming was close enough to spot.She knelt down next to the dog, pointing at a branch with her spindly fingers. \"See that? That's why we're here,\" she told the animal. He brought his eyes skyward, spotting something that was bright yellow, round, and absolutely dripping with the smell of burning sugar. Now and again, the buzzing that was held up inside would free itself from inside the yellow sphere and disappear into the woods. He tilted his head to the side, eyeing the witch with a worried expression.\"Oh, don't worry,\" said Eira. She held up what the dog had assumed was a stand-up kettle to serve the gnomes tea. When the witch walked over to the tree, right below the yellow sphere, and began to tilt the strange metal kettle over, he saw that he was very much mistaken.Smoke billowed from the opening in the kettle, taking the shape of a young, dark sprite as it lifted. She lifted her whispy hands up to her lips, then softly blew into the buzzing orb. The dog bowed his head, hearing the buzzing become very angry and loud right after the smoke entered. Not too soon after, however, all sound died down.\"Marvelous,\" grinned the witch, seeing that the first part of the plan was in action. She crossed her arms and tapped her foot for a good second... then frowned.\"Hm.
