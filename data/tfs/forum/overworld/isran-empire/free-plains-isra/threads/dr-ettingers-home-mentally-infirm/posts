Three people emerged, two masked guards in leather armor dragging a third figure. The man in the center was hooded with what appeared to be a canvas sack, but was otherwise naked save for a ragged loincloth. He struggled and thrashed, fighting against the guards and emitting a low growling noise. The two guards held his arms tightly behind his back, restraining him as he twisted and convulsed. They manhandled him up towards the window, and one of the guards jerked the hood off his head. The man's face was pale, almost white. His lips and tongue were gone, as though they'd been torn or chewed away, leaving his yellowed, broken teeth exposed. His eyes were bloodshot and wide open, flicking back and forth around the room until their gaze finally landed on Naoki through the window. He lunged forward, letting out a choking snarl as he strained against his captors. If Naoki tore her eyes away from his face, she'd notice something moving under the skin of his malnourished chest. A moment later, the man's chest ripped open as his ribcage flared out, the stained bones snapping open and shut like a hungry mouth. As the man struggled and snapped, he seemed to notice the two guards holding him. Naoki would hear a sickening snap as he twisted his head all the way around in an effort to bite one of the guards, but they held him away. The doctor chuckled, seemingly very pleased with his creation.\"Here at Ettinger's, we know all about madness...that is, madness of the mind. It's what we deal in. However, when the expedition came back with knowledge of that tomb, we realized that we'd found something else entirely. This man...no, this creature\u00a0is insane. It has a severe madness of the mind...but also madness of the body. its very flesh is corrupted, as you can see. This creature will not need food, nor water, nor air. It cannot suffer from pain, heat, or chill. However, it still possesses an insatiable hunger for any manner of flesh, human or animal. It will instinctively attack any living being that it lays eyes on. The ritual to create these things, which we found and translated from that tomb, is simple enough that they can be created by the dozens. A sword through this thing's heart will not so much as slow it down. As far as we've seen, removing the head leaves the body blind and deaf...yet it still proves a threat in its convulsions and random lunges. According to our tests, only way we've been able to destroy these creatures is by burning them to ashes. Our research is not complete, of course. We're still working on ways to train these creatures, control them...even grafting blades into their bodies to make them even more dangerous. However, even in such an incomplete, imperfect state...I trust that you can see what a powerful weapon these things could be. Simple and cheap to create, and they can be transported in iron coffins to wherever they must go. We call them locusts, for their hunger and for the way they're created.\"He smiled, watching the man's contortions as he struggled to escape the handler's grasp.\"Now...let us move on.\"The door opened once more, and more armored and masked handlers brought in a large cage. Inside was an adult bear, perhaps 500 pounds or more. The handlers opened the cage and hastily retreated as the bear stepped out, sniffing around. However, as soon as it spotted the locust, it snarled and charged. The locust's handlers jumped out of the way as it lunged forward, colliding with the bear. The animal's sheer mass sent the man flying back, crashing into the opposite wall. Its teeth sank into the locust's shoulder and neck, but the man didn't seem to notice. His ribcage, which moments before had flared open, snapped down on the bear. The sharp bones stabbed into the bear, holding it fast like a spring trap. The bear howled, and the locust twisted its head around to bite at its face and ears. It tore through the bear's fur and skin, ripping into its flesh. The bear reared up on its hind legs, shaking the locust like a rag doll in an effort to dislodge it.\u00a0\"The bear will eventually succumb to blood loss,\" said Dr. Ettinger. \"Either that, or pain, or exhaustion, or any number of things.

Afterwards, they can be restrained by binding them tightly with several layers of canvas, or simply shoving them into boxes or coffins.

As the bear collapsed, succumbing to its injuries, the locust fell upon it and began taking chewing into its flesh. Its flared ribcage relaxed, folding back in upon itself back into the creature's chest.As the locust was distracted, the handlers produced a length of what appeared to be a long canvas bag. Stepping up behind the ravenous monster, they threw the bag over its head and forced it down over its torso. The creature reared back, springing to its feet, but the handlers shoved the bag further down until it covered the struggling locust's entire form. One of the handlers gave the squirming bag a sharp kick, and the locust toppled over. The other pounced on the creature's legs, tying the bag tightly shut with heavy cord. Within moments, the locust was restrained within the bag, struggling and thrashing against the heavy sailcloth but unable to tear itself free. With a dispassionate jerk of the head from the doctor, they picked up the squirming body bag and carried it out of the room. Dr. Ettinger nodded approvingly, turning to Naoki.\"As you can see, Empress...we've become quite adept at restraining these creatures.

Was this a surprise inspection? Something else? He wasn't sure exactly, but was certain that it couldn't be good. Nobody knew very much for certain about the strange old woman known as Grandma, but there were countless rumors and whispers.
