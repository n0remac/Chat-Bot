This has the side effect of leaving his ox, panicked as it is due to the swarm buzzing about, without any sort of guidance. The ox then decides that it values its life over the wagon and the logs, and opts to buck the wagon off its back and start running in no particular direction. This, then, causes the wagon to tip over, and the logs contained therein to spill out and tumble out all across the bridge, inhibiting the frenzied movement of others, bowling a few travelers over, and adding to the state of chaos.
