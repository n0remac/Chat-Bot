All manner of river terrain can be found along its lazy amble to the ocean.Several high waterfalls feed its headwaters straight from the melting snow caps of the Norkaris, and the aquifers below them. Stretches of fast flowing water in the mountains cascade down numerous smaller falls into the foothills of the northern plains. Just past the foothills, the riverbed becomes rocky from years of erosion from the fast flowing waters.When the river finally makes it to the northern plains, it widens considerably. The swift and chaotic water slows and eventually reaches a steady flow, matching the pace of an average human. It is here that the lands turn lush and fertile and the farms start to claim the easily irrigate land to either side.Nearing Isra, the river is nearly complacent, angry only in heavy storms and quick spring thaws. The slow water moves past the city\u2019s east gate docks, where much international trade finds its way from downriver to the southwest. (To enter The Free City of Isra from a water craft, you must post at the East Gate.)Between Isra and Port Silverion, the river continues to widen and shallow. Its speed holds steady from here to the ocean, but the tranquility is broken by Isra\u2019s navy shipyard. Built in the lake formed by a joining of the Silverion and another large river flowing from a small mountain range to the south, the shipyard is the last obstacle the river must traverse before it meets the sea.Finally, after leaving the shipyard lake, thanks to the confluence of the two rivers, the Silverion deepens enough to allow the military craft from upriver to safely sail to their ocean destination. The Silverion\u2019s waters spill into the Free Plains Bay, the sheltered and walled bay of Port Silverion, Isra\u2019s naval and ocean trade secure checkpoint.
