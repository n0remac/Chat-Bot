We had a large caravan of supplies and building materials being transported to our camp so we could begin construction of our settlement, but a force of goblin raiders attacked the convoy during the night and have taken over our hard-earned resources.

The eastern side of their camp and the southern side of the road are lightly wooded. We can set Faisine down along the road to get an audience with their leader - distracting them as much as she can. We can split the rest of us into two teams: Guard Team will make sure Faisine can escape if she needs to and then storm right into the camp, while Team Sneaky will sneaky around the back, find another way in and murder them all in their sleep.\"\"Or failing that, Line will ignite the powder kegs we better hope they collected and blow the entire place back to the cataclysm.\"He nodded, extremely happy with his tactical reasoning. \"Well then!

A red cape, battered and heavy, rustically indicated his leadership of a hundred men, some of whom accompanied him today. At his left hip, a spatha remained sheathed in its leather scabbard, a smaller dagger across from it on his right hip.  \u00a0 \u00a0 The tall, dark clouds and the occasional lightning had followed through on their early threat, as rain began to fall down upon the plains, building steadily from a sprinkle.\u00a0Zaltos could see the outside of the burly man's left arm was tattooed from hand to shoulder; drops of rainwater rolled down an array of hauntingly alien figures, noneuclidean geometries and contorted glyphic, tribal features written permanently across his limb. Wolfgang suppressed the acquisition of mana, and addressed the newcomer with a genuine smile through a beard that was slowly getting wet from the rain. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Greetings,\" he said in his growl of a voice, \"I am Wolfgang, humble leader of the Greydan people. I know of no desert, though our guide, Vale, may know very well.

The flicker of flames could be seen by the light in produced if one was as close as Wolfgang. Zaltos would then move from behind the boulders, turning to face Wolfgang.<br/><br/>Zaltos's body was hidden within a silky red cape. The cape hung from extensions of armor that extended from his shoulder. The cape latched together at the top of his breastplate. On his head was a helm fit for a king. It had a crown design on the top and a silky red cloth that covered from the bridge of his nose to the cape's latch.<br/><br/>What was visible was his sky blue eyes that shined and silver tips of hair that draped around the neck from under the helm. His whole face became visible when he removed his helm, showing revealing his tan skin. His hair was silver, long, and silky.<br/><br/>Zaltos would begin to speak, his fanged teeth would reveal themselves.

Weak fire or not, it was fire, and Zaltos could make it grow and do what he wanted.In the confines of his cape that covered his body, he would begin flexing his fingertip muscles within the confines of his armor gloves.

Overhearing the females conversation with the other members of the Greydan Band, Zaltos was aware of why  she was here and who she was. He wasn't expecting someone else new to show up so quickly, so he was very wary of her.\"Her name is Raven. She was caught quickly in her attempts to try and infiltrate your camp, brushing it off quickly. Weaved her way in with a dinner invitation, and now she's giving you her weapon in hopes you'll trust her while she was here.\" Zaltos spoke, cutting off Raven before she could get a word out.Zaltos would smirk a little before he spoke to Raven, \"The question is, why were you sneaking up on the camp if your intentions were good? I personally don't think you will harm anyone, but your approach was very...odd. Especially since this clan would notice anyone not within their ranks immediately. But don't answer yet. They're bringing dinner this way, so we can sit, eat, and discuss this with a more positive and comfortable tone.\"Zaltos was puzzled on what the answer to this question could be.

They intentionally spread their ranks far and wide as each individual charged in the direction of the arrows. Moving into the cover of darkness and unpredictability, the rapidly advancing Greydan would prove incredibly difficult to target on the second volley, yet were simultaneously cognizant of where the attack had come from. As the human eye possessed incredible depth perception and the mind a great capacity for trajectory calculation, the exact location on the plateau was likely to be targeted. The hunt was on... like ants, they'd eventually swarm the base of the geological formation in pursuit.

He could see movement in the woodlands ahead, but he couldn't tell if it was friend or foe at the time. The dark was definitely a hindrance to Zaltos, but his senses could still function extremely well in the dark, just not as definite. One thing he could feel indefinitely was the web of energy and scent that was being given off.\"Raven, we can't wait till morning, but I do believe now would be prime time to find some cover. They're  taking places and formations in the woodlands, possibly surrounding the Greydan inside the woodlands and readying to strike us.

He was obviously noticeable in his red attire. He would move away from the other two, directing the arrows away as he waved for the other two to go on to the alcove. Once he was a good enough distance away, he would stop and his cape would begin to morph and latch to the armor beneath it.The armor beneath that began to show was a very deep purple, nearly black. The trimming on the armor was a dark forest green. The armor was less bulky, the armor fitting to his body in a spandex style. This armor resembled that of Scorpion's from MK, from face mask to shoes. His ice blue eyes gazed upon the woodlands, his form now invisible to the enemy, his upper torso blending in with the background of sky and plains. Zaltos lifted his right hand to mouth in the form a fist. He would speak into his hand and when he was done, he would open it, letting off the message and a baseball sized burst of fire. This message would be for Raven and Wolfgang.\"They've lined the borders. The arrows were coming from multiple points. That fire would be real nice right about now. They've got us separated from your men. Only way we're going to break that line of archers is to burn them back. I'm going to throw my shield to you, set it up as a wall to protect you from the fire. What you summon Wolfgang, i'm going to amplify. When I clear the field and leave the wall on the border, i'll carry you through the fire. Your men will know something is up, and they'll be able to see any enemies behind them. If we can carry this out, the enemy will only have one place to go, back to the top.\"In the distance, two hundred or so yards into the woodlands, Zaltos could feel energy being gathered. It was just starting, but whatever it was, it was directed this way. Summoning magic was at play, but Zaltos wouldn't inform the other of what he was noticing. He couldn't give his position away, this next move needed to be a surprise. Zaltos lowered his form to an arrow stance. The top half of his head is all that remained above the tall grass of the plain as he lowered. His right leg extended fully backwards and his left leg would come to bend, his knee pointed at the woodlands leading to the top of the plateau. His energy was refocusing now as his armor change, preparing to take grasp of the fire that was to be summoned.\"I hope this can get done before whatever the enemy summons can take form. I need that fire for power or  I could be in real trouble if what he summons is actually powerful, and Elves of any kind don't summon anything weak. I need a higher ranked being for questioning, and if the bodies are still intact I can drain them of their energy.\"  Zaltos thought to himself as he waited for his chance to strike.

Use it when you find the other summoner.\" Zaltos then took notice to the gem, \"Raven, for everyone's sake, do not let them get ahold of that gem.

Faisine's disappearance would not go unnoticed for long, especially after the battle when those who went on the mission to the enemy camp were accounted for in an attendance-call by Council Member Owyn. The squad consisted of eight highly trained light rangers, specifically formed to track and scout over long distances. After spending time analysing any tracks (which was quite easy due to the previous rain that left the ground rather moist) on the outskirts away from the battle, they discovered what they collectively agreed to be signs of a struggle and kidnapping. With the correct set of tracks now in their sights, they followed after Faisine. -----The next morning, a great victory was celebrated with a breakfast feast. Goblin carcasses were burnt husks on the remains of a bonfire on the outskirts of the camp and several council-members were addressing soldiers and volunteers who had helped deal with the greenskin menace. Many people sat around open fires or at joined street-tables filled with sausages, bacon, eggs and breads and the morale of the settlers seemed to have been greatly improved.All went quiet, however, when Owyn decided to make a small speech.\"Fellow settlers, last night our brave volunteers and soldiers proved that our dream of a better life for our families cannot be undone so easily. These Free Plains are where we have chosen to make our future homes and now, those homes can be built with earnest! Of course, many of you lost materials and resources due to what was undoubtedly a cowardly raid on our caravan, but we did not lose all. We still have enough to start laying our foundations and building our supports and in just a few short months our first fully-furnished community will be finished. Of course, the going will be tough. We will need to gather more resources, gather lumber from the trees and stone from the mountains, but with hard work and perseverance we can succeed!\"Suddenly, two of the volunteers from the previous evening stepped up onto the stage; Owyn seemed surprised and a little annoyed at the sudden appearance of Elden and Line, but it seemed they had something important to say. Elden was the one to speak, his lip movements covering a grin. \"Friends, me and my colleague here were two of those who went to try and deal with the goblin camp. Of course, it did not work out as expected but... Well, we have some rather good news. You see, as we now know, the entire thing was a trap. The camp was empty and destroyed, which leads to one question... Why would the goblins keep all those valuable resources there? Those wood planks, crates of goods, stonemason tools and stone bricks?\"\"They wouldn't, obviously,\" Line butt in. \"So I used my farsight magic to search for a certain sign of life-sign. Specifically that of the large, muscular oxen and horses that would pull wagons and carts.\"Elden interrupted Line's butting in, exclaiming, \"the goblins moved our resources and we've found where to! A large cave-opening at the base of the mountains. A treasure-cove of almost everything they stole from us and more! We've already told the commander of our new guard and they're taking steps to move it to our stockpiles as we speak!\"There was a loud cheer from the crowd, with several hats thrown into the air and the downing of early-morn' ale. Elden and Line were all but pushed into the crowd where they were greeted like heroes and forced to sit at waiting plates with food piled high, while Owyn chuckled and took back to the centre stage.\"Well then,\" Owyn picked up, \"I guess it's better than expected. Alas, I have to dampen the mood with the announcement of my retirement from my position. These past several weeks, I have been something of an unofficial leader to my people and head of our co-operative council. It's time for me to step down and for a real system of government to be formed in my stead. The current council will no doubt stay on, but they have much to discuss in my absence as to who and how they decide to lead us. I would like to thank all of you for your continued support and for believing in our shared dream and I will still be here to help however is needed.\"The crowd had gone much quieter. It wasn't a particularly sad announcement, but still shocking to many. Owyn merely smiled and made his way back to his tent to eat with his family.

And we've got the smaller ones under control.\"The chattering of the workers seemed to slow. Many of the volunteer wildfire fighters were tired by this point, and much of their water used despite their horses being pushed to near-exhaustion carting water back from the river to resupply them. For now, it looked like they would finally find some peace without worry. \"All right,\" spoke a commander of the guard to a gathering of people. \"We'll keep a couple of men out here to make sure the fire doesn't come back but it looks as though it's under control. Whatever creatures and dragons caused this seem to be reversing the spread of flames. We should go back to our camp, for it's not our place to intervene with the affairs of those with this sort of power and even if it was - our camp does not have the strength. Better to just return and hope to be able to build in peace from now on. I think I've quite had enough of battling threats to our dream for one week.\"Many of them agreed. It had been an exhausting few days for their people and the majority of them wished only to be left for a while. For things to return to normality and for their construction efforts to go on as planned. With carts and horses in tow, most of the volunteers began making their way back to the settler's camp, where life had been suspended momentarily in favour of trying to dig a small channel, or moat, around their camp in a last ditch effort to prevent a fire that would likely never reach them. Work on the channel would continue anyway, since what had been started might as well be finished. It would also make the camp more easily defensible, since the channels were being lined on the inside by a sort of mound topped by palisade walls from the extra lumber they had found. They had learned a harsh lesson. The world was dangerous and there would be many trials ahead of them - trials they needed to be prepared for. If nothing else happened, the rest of the day in the camp would be life returning to normal. ", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"That's it, right? It's ending?

Stationed at regular intervals around the city's borders and into the plains, the first group of guards would stand stationary and watch their surroundings. The second group, with similar space between them, would do a circular rotation, reporting with each of the stationary guards as they made their way around. After an hour or so, the groups would switch from stationary to patrolling, and vice versa. Each of the guards had a signal horn, and if a stationary guard was not at his post, or a patrolling guard didn't show up, they were to blow the horn. This would ensure every guard was accounted for, and help isolate the location of any breach. Satisfied the guards understood her orders, she sent them out.

Outriders. That other dead clan left em scared of more'v us. We got ta be careful if we gonna hit em. Pick off the tired pinkies that fall behind. A big raid would kill too many'v our boys. Let's go back for now.\"Although the scouts look extraordinarily disappointed, they obey their leader's orders and the three turn back for camp. The trip takes about half an hour, and the sun is just cresting one of three mesas that close the camp off from the sight of passersby. Full of crude thatch huts linked by swaying rope bridges and standing upon rotting wooden stilts and permeated by the mixed smells of roasting hog and rotting flesh, the village is rather expansive, Goblins hobbling and lurching around its length. The huts are arranged in a crude circle, the largest of the huts in the center, standing tall above all of them with one entrance on every side, totaling five. It is also the most fortified; instead of rope bridges linking to the surrounding huts, it has crude drawbridges operated by rope pullies, and the six stilts that hold it aloft are reinforced with rigid iron. The only entrance from the ground is up a retractable bone ladder and through a small locked hatch on the bottom. The entire thing is made of the best wood that could be found in the area, and the roof is made of crudely crafted ceramic rather than thatch. It's clear this is the Goblin Clan's version of a keep, and it's the first place Tharka goes, muscling through the mass of Goblins. He climbs up the ladder and unlocks the hatch on the bottom, climbing through.The interior is dark and musty, dust and smoke filling the air, only a small portion of it escaping from a small hole in the ceiling, barely large enough for a constrictor snake to fit through. It would sting the eyes of any creature other than the surprisingly resilient Goblin, whose eyes are far less sensitive to floating particles than most, due to their evolution in the dusty underground. Upon each of the five walls is a glowing red torch, the smell of burning pitch barely slicing through the thick musk of rot and uncleanliness. Mounted upon the far wall are trophies from Tharka's conquests; dried heads of fallen enemies, the skulls of those who challenged his authority over the Clan. He takes a seat upon the bone-crafted throne in the center of the room.After a long moment of deliberation, Tharka turns to his advisors, who happen to be a pair of enchanted severed heads named Grok and Frok, a pair of bickering Goblin brothers whose unique status allowed them to be planted on stakes indefinitely, requiring no food or drink, though sleep was still welcome. \"Boys,\" says Tharka, and the two heads perk up, \"I gots me a dilemma. Them pinkies are guarding them refugees too good, an I know I can't be gettin them shiny goodies without gettin lotsa me boys killed. But I really want them shinies. What I gotta do?\"The heads both think for a moment, and then speak up, the more guttural, violent voice of Grok speaking first, \"Ya should jus go in an chop em up,\" he says, \"pinkies got no tough skin, they be goin down like roks on ther good days.\"The higher-pitched, more conniving tones of Frok speak up in protest, \"No, no, no! That's just stupid! You stupid!\" The head swivels around on its stake to face Tharka, \"Wait till they be calmin down from them other greenies before gettin in there, otherways they be killin you quick!

This wasn\u2019t quite like any other outing she had taken anyone on. There wasn\u2019t an ulterior motive, no deals to be closed, no secrets to be divined, this was purely for the enjoyment of all involved. Thinking further, Naoki realizes that she is unaware of a number of basic facts about Kate. Simple things, like favorite color and birthdate. Thinking still further, an interrogation session about small facts would make for terrible conversation. This topic, the topic of topics, if you will, plagues Naoki as she walks; the well worn road slowly transitioning into the open plains.

Most of Naoki\u2019s own life experiences wouldn\u2019t make very good stories to tell. Too many of them included copious amounts of deceit on her part, or ended with Artemis committing murder. Not the sorts of impressions she was trying to give. Naoki twitches a bit as Kate begins to play with her ears. Up until this point, nobody has really touched her ears. However, the sensation was not unpleasant. A story from a book, perhaps. Naoki has read a great number of myths and fables, surely one of those would be applicable.

Interesting philosophical reads, all of them, but not the types of stories to tell one\u2019s lover.At this point, Naoki resolves to, at her next earliest convenience, obtain and memorize a number of stories that would be suitable to tell Kate in the future.

Tell me, Kate. What do you think the nature of happiness is? Is happiness synonymous with being content? Is it synonymous with pleasure~?\u201dNaoki's voice rises a few octaves as her ears, which are evidently rather sensitive, continue to be fondled. She pauses, and clears her throat before continuing. \u201cIs it merely an emotion, that comes and goes through one\u2019s mind? Is it an objective state of being, to be happy? Is happiness, nothing more than the feeling achieved when one reaches their goals?\u201dSmall moans intersperse themselves between her words as Naoki attempts to finish her thought. She shivers against Kate, and clenches her operable fist.\u201cOr, do you think it, ah~, has something to do with others?

In the warm glow of the aftershock, her mind wanders.This must be pretty much it. Perched on an unassailable mountainside on a warm autumn day, joined by her closest partners, with good food and without obligations. From here, how would life improve? How could life improve? What possible enhancements could be made to build on this high, what new peaks did life have to offer? According to Kate\u2019s philosophy, is this Naoki\u2019s own ultimate happiness? Does this climax mark the highest point of her life, the vertex from which the only path is to spiral downwards? Would the forces that be swing her back down from whence she came, back down to the dark pits of poverty and emotional trauma, like some sort of perverse pendulum? Was this the end? These thoughts and others lazily drift their way across the forefront of her mind, much like the clouds across the pale sky. For even at this, the highest of highs, Naoki is unable to find peace with herself. However, Naoki is content, at least partially. This feeling manifests as a sigh, a warm flow of air quietly slipping between her lips. She adjusts herself slightly, to lie more comfortably. Of course, Kate hadn\u2019t really answered her question. Naoki had asked about the nature of happiness, what it is, in its most basic form. What Kate had said was agreeable, certainly, but Naoki was looking for an answer along the lines of, \u201cHappiness is a delusion, a figment of one\u2019s imagination, for the purpose of putting the mind at ease\u201d or perhaps \u201cHappiness is a state of being, in which the individual is satisfied, without pain, regret, or fear\u201d.Personally, Naoki is still unsure of what exactly the nature of happiness may be. Which was, at least partially, why she asked. However, she finds herself forming a new hypothesis as she lies there. \u201cHappiness is believing that one is happy.\u201d She supposes that one stands alone as the sole interpreter of their own life, and if an individual understands themselves to be happy, they are, and there may not be much more to it than that.Under this hypothesis, Naoki supposes that she would be, in fact, happy. Judging this theory to be both agreeable and to her liking, she adopts it as her own. But enough of that. It was time to attend to more pressing matters. In her now stabilized state of mind, Madame Naoki slowly rises, propping herself up on one arm. Kate had caught her by surprise, but now it was her turn. With only a sultry smirk from her lips, Naoki puts the reversal onto Kate, gently pushing her down into the blankets.Naoki\u2019s lips come down to meet Kate\u2019s in a searing kiss, as the two women begin to lose themselves in each other.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "With a strangled cry, Naoki unravels under Kate\u2019s teeth, holding the other woman tightly as shudders run through her body, before collapsing limply onto the blanket.

He muttered under his breath about how idiotic he was to suggest this place as the destination to meet up, it was just so green and boring and flat! The only positive aspect was the ease at which he was able to procure additional ingredients as the animals that called this place home were no match for Maelik's sheer speed and size. Whenever he spotted a particularly juicy looking kill he'd simply reach down whilst flying past it and snag it by the neck, the sudden jerk usually enough to outright kill the thing. Although in the case of anything surviving the experience the demon wasn't in any hurry to finish it off, after all... the fresher the meat, the better the taste.Eventually he gave up on the idea of finding a premium spot out in the open so he moved on to the nearby woods, however the many tree trunks of various sizes were not as accommodating to his flight style, a fact that Maelik learned the hard way as he smashed through tree after tree with decreasing success.CRASH! CRASH! CRASH!...Crash.....crash......crash.........crash..........Thud.Maelik picked himself up after playing chicken with an especially thick trunk and losing... by a lot, and conducted an assessment of the various wounds he sustained.\"Hmm, a few bruises, a couple scrapes, only a few cuts but no brain damage so that's good... but no brain damage so that's good... but no brain damage so that's good... Oh hey what's that!?\"A waterfall only a few dozen feet away caught the attention of the questionably sane demon, the glistening water splashing softly down into a large pool at the base. It would have been the perfect place to set up shop for his romantic dinner, except for one tiny little hiccup. It seems that the place was already claimed, a small campsite seemed to have been erected and in Maelik's eyes that made it tainted.However, that did not mean that the unclaimed space at the top of the waterfall fell under that same category. And just like that he started woozily making his way up the face of the rocky cliff, manually climbing it simply because he was too addled to remember he could fly. And once he had conquered that (relatively) daunting task he was met with a sight that he would argue to be even more picturesque. Rather than having the benefit of seeing the waterfall gracefully touch down upon the water like the previous spot this new place sported a more open view of the sky and had soft grass of its own just a bit farther down the river as well. In addition the quietly babbling river was impressive in its own right but both of those things paled in comparison to the sheer breathtaking beauty that the altitude of the place afforded. If one would just peer over the edge of the waterfall then they'd bear witness to not only the tranquil pool down below but they'd also be given a panoramic view of the forest itself and by consequence most of the plains as well, even Isra was visible from this point. He could only imagine how majestic it will look once the last lights of day are overtaken by the soft darkness of night.\"Still... it isn't good enough... But that just means I need to improve it a bit!\"And so the construction of what Maelik called, 'The Gargantuan Grand Gazebo' had begun! After collecting and treating the wood from the trees he felled with his head, (totally intentional!) the actual making of the thing wasn't that hard. Sure he had no nails or tools of any kind but it would take a lot more than that to stop him from completing the inane goal he set out for himself! To compensate for the lack of nails he resorted to older methods of construction and used wooden pegs, and as for the total lack of a hammer or a saw he used his fists and tail blade.It was a hard job to finish but when all was said and done there was a sturdily built gazebo smack dab in the middle of the river suspended in midair by two bridges. Now the Lord, hard of breath and seeing things in doubles forced himself to move on to setting up the fireworks in a nearby but still out of sight location, a task made more difficult by his inability to think straight but eventually even that was done. At that point he staggered over to the gazebo once more and summoned a minor imp to finish setting up the cooking equipment and once finished to go and find Lum's group and escort them to this spot when their business was finished.\"Ummm, you okay there boss?\" it asked in its high pitched voice upon noticing the blood practically oozing from Maelik's maw and eyes, \"cause you ain't exactly lookin' too hot...\"Maelik bent down low with a tender smile, something that made the imp immediately realize that he screwed up.\"Are you implying that I'm unattractive?\" the Lord asked in a quiet, almost wispy voice, his eyes unfocused but still giving off that pant soiling feeling of dread.\"N-no! Did I say hot? I meant to say... um... healthy?\" The imp shrunk back and his last few words came out as an almost inaudible squeak.\"So then it's not that I'm not hunky it's that I'm not in shape?\" Maelik growled, his draconian snout, and all the needle sharp fangs that it held just inches from the poor imp's head.\"I- uh I didn't mean it like that I-\" it began but was cut off by the firm hold of the Lord's hand squeezing around the tiny demon's head, and tightening its grip with every passing second. After a short struggle in which the imp flailed useless against the iron death grip of its summoner there was a loud crack as Maelik collapsed its skull in with minimal effort.Maelik would then callously drop the still twitching imp and released his summons before enacting another one, only this time a fluffier and far more terrified imp answered the call.\"You shaw your predecesshor ash he returned yesh?\" Maelik asked with a slur, his mind becoming so blurry that not even his rage could sharpen it.\"Yesh... I mean yes boss!\" the new imp yelped.\"Good,\" he said and after giving the description of Lum, Jun and Arya he sent it on it's way, settling to finish the rest of the preparations by himself.He got about as far as setting up the fire pit and lighting a fire before passing out, his head slamming into the the coals and causing the fire's brilliant orange flames to darken to black.

He couldn't focus his mind enough to push away the nightmares, and he couldn't lie well enough to convince himself that he didn't regret any of it.But then a soothing sensation rolled over him, both easing his body's physical suffering and exasperating his mind's psychological conflict. The roiling vortex of his subconscious feral instinct, malevolent intent and psychotic bloodthirstiness combating his more civilized rational mind that enforced his code of ethics and his more positive attributes.On the outside it would seem as though his decimated body was regressing back to full health. His shattered wings regained their semblance, his indented maw pushing back out to normal, even his mangled arms and broken fingers cracking back into place. And then suddenly he convulsed before awaking with a start. Immediately his head sharply twisted towards the assembled group and he let out a snarl, his lips drawn back to reveal those same shining fangs that often sent poor Jeffery into panic attacks. He gave an especially venomous hiss towards Arya, her general garb and weaponry inciting his ire moreso than either Doobie or the twins. Jun on the other hand seemed exempt from this sudden hatred as he didn't even levy a glance her way.He snapped his jaws and growled, black flames puffing out from his nostrils and the sides of his mouth as the Lord writhed about until he managed to put on clawed hand to the ground. At this point Jeffery was already hiding behind Jun's legs (wanting to be nowhere near Lum for obvious reasons) and was shaking hard.Then he writhed until he managed to get on all fours to where he stared up at Lum with hostility that surpassed even that which he showed for the paladin, evident from the rigid tension in his muscles that signaled his readiness to pounce. However from here his merciless gaze softened and his body relaxed, a flash of confusion evident on his face before it was enveloped with a near instant smile.\"Lum my darling! You came! Oh how glorious!\" With a bounce he was back on his feet, trying to usher her and the rest into the gazebo. He noted that the twins seemed to have gotten involved at some point and even stranger was the appearance of some strange kobold.\"Well, as they say the more the merrier so come on in, I hope that you find the place accommodating, I built it myself with the trees from the forest that I felled by accident, you could say I've got a real 'head' for it and that I'm 'branching' out into carpentry but for the most part I'm 'stumped'.\" He laughed a bit at his own terrible puns before stepping foot into the newly constructed structure and took note of the few things that still needed to be done before dinner could begin in earnest.\"Dinner will be on the way shortly.

Oh but first I'll need his help for just a minute so please pardon the intrusion my dears.\"As he spoke he ushered the imp towards him, a spot a good few dozen away from the sitting area where the others were directed to.

To be able to simply manifest objects (however small) into existence was impressive and were he able to do anything similar he wouldn't have to dirty his hands and waste his time with ingredient gathering. But he lacked the knowledge necessary to even hope to attempt such sorcery so the demon chef had to work with what he had on him.So he removed his armor, stripping down to his scarce undergarments to reveal his toned, muscular body and rifled through his bag to grab his apron that read, 'Hot surface, kiss at own risk'. Now that he was appropriately attired he was ready to begin and with a flick of his wrist he fanned life into the grill, sparking a fire that quickly roared into a satisfying blaze. While he waited for the fire to heat up the metal bars to the proper temperature Maelik went to work on some of the boars he snagged back in the open plains, washing his hands, tail, wings and tail blade clean of any dirt before laying the beast out on the counter. Once it was in the right position he set to ripping off limbs and cleaning out its innards so that he could extract the more desirable meat without any pesky intestines or stomachs getting in the way. He did this to about three or so boars, pulling out the ribs and gingerly slicing his choice cuts from their flanks.From there he separated the gore from what he actually wished to cook and washed away the blood so that he could better assess what he had to work with.\"I'm glad I chose to go with the beefier looking hogs, there's not much fat here to ruin things,\" he muttered whilst taking a wickedly sharp silver knife to the grizzle, sheering away whatever imperfections his expert eye could find.Following that the Lord once again washed his hands vigorously in order to get the blood out of his claws and threw some potatoes in a small iron box whilst using his wings to peel ears of corn. His tail too seemed to be in a flurry of motion, dexterously handling the complex task of cutting the thin layer of pasty dough and dicing the fruit needed to make a proper pie.With a practiced pace Maelik powered through the set up and was making startling progress with the actual cooking as well. The ribs and other cuts of meat were already sizzling on the grill with the corn (already buttered) quickly turning about beside it, the pie was in a small portable stove and the iron potato box was under a constant deluge of demonic fire, roasting the spuds within.Within a matter of about ten or so minutes the only step remaining was the slathering of his super secret sauce of salvation, he was back at the table in no time flat, arms laden with platters that he hastily placed on the table in the most aesthetically pleasing way he could manage. Almost immediately after dumping his payload he plucked a few of Lum's hor d'eouvres and sampled them.His discerning taste was usually the nightmare of many an aspiring chef, preceded only by the inevitable brow beating that would be sure to follow and small failure, but to Maelik's surprise these tasted better than some of the things he's had from most professional chefs.\"My word Lum, where did you learn to do this?

Even now two more ruby gems dulled, out of power leaving Arya with only three of the gems left. Two of the size she had been using and the crown jewel of the blade, much larger than the other gems. Even without her tapping into the gem's power, the largest gem's energy could be felt in the air as she fought, like a massive torrent held back by only the thinnest of dams. Arya did not draw from this gem yet however, using the remaining two smaller gems she had and drawing every bit of power in them into her form.\u00a0Immediately the holy aura about Arya seemed to grow stronger and stronger by the moment, until she was glowing with holy energy in her knelt form, the mere presence of the holy energy within her already pushing back the darkness, and she had not drained the gems completely yet. Even as the malevolence of Maelik's magic gnawed at the edge of one's soul and chilled their bones with the dark foreboding presence of death, the holy energy of Arya's own power fought back, a purifying force that would burn all evil without prejudice. As the holy magic within Arya grew even more, the ground beneath her would come alight, forming an intricate maze of runes that glowed in defiance of the darkness around her. These runes would then be consumed by holy flames, as her form seemed to become engulfed by them as well, the flames arising from her sword and spreading as the energy began to escape a bit.\u00a0When the presence of holy energy would seem to be almost completely overwhelming the darkness, and a large portion of the darkness seemed to be fought back, the flames would begin to die down, and Arya's form could be seen standing up. The girl's movements seemed slow as she stood up, as if the whole ordeal was becoming a drag, boring even. As the holy flames cleared and one could get a better look at Arya's form her very armor seemed to be alight in a holy glow much as the runes that surrounded her on the ground had glowed. Her sword also seemed to be alight in the same holy light, small flickering flames popping up along it's edges occasionally. Just then, Arya's eyes opened and the holy energy in the area could be felt growing by a few degrees. Her red irises were completely gone, replaced by the same bright holy light, a bright piercing gaze that seemed to look right through anything it regarded.\u00a0Arya's purifying gaze would fixate itself on Maelik then, her sword lowered at her side and her form seemed completely open to attack, but it didn't matter, \"The time for games is over,\" she chided, \"Show me what you truly can do, if you have anything else left.\" The last two of the smaller rubies dulled then as Arya began her attack, launching a blast of holy energy with a lazy swipe of her sword. The bolt of energy, Maelik would find would be somewhat harder to dodge than her previous attacks as it would home in on him.

However, recent events lead me to believe that there would be some benefit in Maelik hearing this tale as well.\u201dThe dragoness looks each person in the eye: Jun of the Celadine, Arya Shieldheart, Maelik The Fellblade, Doobie du Shoobie, and Jeffery. Once she is certain she has their attention, she begins to speak once again. \u201cI was not born a holy dragon, I was born a red dragon. In my youth I was cruel, malicious, and destructive. I roamed the countryside razing villages, slaughtering peasants, and gathering lucre to build my hoard. For centuries I was a terror until, finally, inevitably, a group of knights hunted me down. They grievously wounded me, drove me from my cave, and though I escaped I eventually collapsed in a field. At that moment I was certain I had reached my end, and I was filled with such rage and hatred for the people who had laid me low.\u201dLum\u2019s normally bright and joyful face has turned dark with her reverie. She pauses, letting her words sink in for a long moment.\u201cThen the farmer came to me. He was old well past his prime, living by himself. His wife was dead, his children had their own farms, all that was left was him and his dog. Had I the strength I would have killed him. Simply because he saw me in a weakened state, and this hurt my pride. I didn\u2019t have the strength, though. I was forced to watch helplessly as he walked right up to me, there was nothing I could do. I, a mighty red dragon, was completely at the mercy of this old farmer.\u201dAgain a pause. Lum\u2019s face has not yet returned to its usual brightness, though she now wears a small smile.\u201cHe tended my wounds. Not well, and not swiftly, but as best as he was able. He brought me food, as much as he could afford. He brought me water, as much as he could manage. At first I did not question his actions. It seemed natural to me, this small pathetic creature should pay me tribute. Still, I needed him to know that I would not let him live simply because he aided me. Every day I told him that when my strength returned I would devour him. Every day the old farmer would listen to my threat, smile, nod, and then tell me about his life. He told me how he met his wife, he told me how he struggled to afford his own farm, he told me of the joy he felt when he had enough money to marry, and he told me of the happiness he felt when she said yes.\u201dAnother pause. Lum\u2019s face shines with joy at the memories. Her smile is bright, but her eyes are glassy.\u201cHe told of when his first child was born, of sleepless nights, of watching him grow up, of his second child, his third, eventually of his grandchildren. One day he even brought his youngest grandchild to meet me, she had bright blue eyes, golden locks, and the sweetest smile. She looked at me not with terror, but wonder! To her I was a grand secret her grandfather had shared with her, and I was beautiful. One day I surprised the old man, when he came to visit I stood up. I had recovered enough to move, and he asked me if I was finally going to eat him. I remember how calm he was, not an ounce of fear, just calm acceptance, and absolute faith. I did not eat him, I told him he was far too old and stringy. He asked if I would go to the village, eat the people there. I told him I wasn\u2019t well enough to fight a village. He asked if I would got to his eldest son\u2019s farm, they were nearby and would be easy prey. I told him I would not. He asked me why.\u201dThough Lum still smiles, tears are now rolling down her face. Her voice is now choked and coarse.\u201cI told him that I couldn\u2019t eat them, because that would upset his granddaughter. The old farmer then smiled at me, and he nodded, and I left. I would return every few months to spend time with the farmer, and his granddaughter. Eventually he brought his other grandchildren, then his sons and daughters. Soon his entire family became mine, and the whole village spoke of the farmer who tamed a dragon. I had stopped preying on human settlements, instead hunting in the wilder lands. One day I returned from a hunting trip, to find the village a smoking ruin, the farms razed, and my family dead. The only survivor was the old farmer, crucified in the centre of town.

Back then all I knew was fire and destructive magics. I could do nothing to help him, but cut him down. He was still conscious, I told him I would avenge him, avenge everyone in the village. I would become a righteous wrath! I would rain fury, and death upon those who had done this. He told me no. I asked him why. He told me another story, one he had never told me before. He told me how his wife died, bathed in fire, while visiting her sister. Her sister who lived in a village near my lair, one I had destroyed. He told me how he found me in the field, how he knew who I was. He told me how, when he first saw me, he had been filled with such anger. He told me he had thought about killing me. He told me how he thought about driving his pitchfork into my throat. Finally he told me why he didn\u2019t do it. He told me of his wife, how she had believed everyone deserved forgiveness, love, a chance at redemption. He spoke and I wept. I wept for him, I wept for what had happened, I wept for what I had done, I wept because for all my strength I was powerless.\u201dSilence, soft, quiet, serene.

He could not go throughout his days without thinking back on their time together, and how she had been such an amazing fighter, when they clashed. These thoughts steadily lead him to where they had first encountered one another, though it was under different circumstances. They had been enemies then, and the ravaged terrain had remained unchanged. Large, entrenching scars scoured the area, collapsed rock faces strewn upon the floor, and scorched earth surrounded him. Samael stood within the epicenter of it all, his great-sword weighing upon his right shoulder as he stares over to the horizon. To any observer, it would appear as if space itself spat him out, an ominous rift that leaked cold ripping apart for him. It was entirely unnatural in its existence, and quickly faded into nothingness within a blink of an eye. Samael seemed content with thinking back on the past, and was turning to venture off, once it became apparent that she wasn't here. He had spent countless hours back-tracking, given hints that she had been going along a set path of memories.

She looked up at him, disbelief warring with hope for dominance in her gaze, as he continued to speak. He wanted to be with her. <i>Just</i> her. He wouldn't try to break her, to make her Fall.. because he wanted her just the way he was. Did he..? Could he possibly..? He hadn't said the words. Not explicitly. But what he <i>had</i> said... By the Divines. It certainly sounded like love.<br/><br/>Not trusting her voice, as her throat was clogged with the threat of tears - and she had said she would never cry in front of him again; that was a promise she would keep - Naenia decided that, perhaps, the best way to answer him was with actions. Stepping hesitantly forward to close the space between their bodies, her hands lifted, moving to frame his handsome features. As she tilted her head up and pulled him down to her, those large white wings stretched outward and curled forward, enveloping both of their bodies in a feathery cocoon. Unable to find the ability to speak, she kissed him instead, giving him her answer in a kiss that was intense yet tender, passionate yet loving, heated yet sweet. It told him everything that she couldn't bring herself to say.<br/><br/><i>I missed you. Please don't leave me again. Everything that I can give is yours. I love you.</i></br></font>"}, "post-31426": {"user": "Samael", "user_num": 1250, "timestamp": "1459668733000", "message": "Samael found himself drawing closer as Naenia appeared intent upon sticking around, after all.

There were a couple guards, as Zavius expected, one posted at the front of the house and one at the back.

He let the man down gently to the floor, avoiding the sound of a body falling on the hard marble flooring of\u00a0the porch that wrapped around the house.Retrieving the knife, Zavius took a moment to take stock of his situation and find a decent point of entry, he suspected there would be more guards somewhere inside.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The Free Plains, by now a relatively safe expanse of land as Isra's strength has grown.

He hated me for leaving, and he gave me an offer: return to the archipelago I once called home or he would kill my kittens.\"She looks over at Alden, eyes wide. \"He knew, Alden. I don't know how, but he did, and he must have had troops outside the house. I couldn't risk it. Even though I knew you could take them, I couldn't risk it. So I went along with him.

But I do not think that I would deny them the chance at the joy you might bring them for fear of the pain you might cause.\" He would shelter them from all pain if he could but he'd learned that sometimes a small risk came. Her refusal of his offer to eliminate her family and religious order does not come as a surprise. Even if his children hurt him he had trouble imagining hurting them back for any reason.

Despite, or because of, five years with six children he'd come to realize just how much he enjoyed silence. It was also a state of being for him, he was unnaturally quiet in a way that few things could hope to be. Even when sitting still most people made some measure of noise that could be heard, but not Alden. If one wasn't looking directly at him it was possible to forget he was even there. Sometimes he wasn't he could leave without noise just as easily as he sat without.

I have not seen them since they were barely a month old. Have they grown well? Our species reaches maturity much quicker than yours, but since they're partly of your blood, I am unsure how fast they will become fully grown,\" she muses, her gaze returning to the flames to watch them dance and curl in the night breeze. She tosses another stick into the flame and watches it flare up ever so slightly, her mind filled with thoughts of her old home, of Isra, of how good it'll be to come back.Something has still gone unsaid, though. It shows on her face as her brows furrow once again, casting a concerned shadow across her visage. She looks up at Alden, cocking her head just a touch.\"Alden...\" she begins, slowly, \"is there...anyone else?\"She regrets asking the question almost immediately. Of course he would have moved on in her absence. Any sane person would. And women tended toward men who could prove apt at raising children -- or at least, they did in her society.

The smile dipping a few inches as he thinks of how best to answer it. \"There is not.\" He says slowly. \"I had a few abortive attempts at romance. But I came to realize I was doing it more because I wanted my children to have a mother, rather than true affection for the women I was dealing with.\" Another pause and he rubs his face. \"That doesn't mean that we will start back up whatever we had before. It doesn't rule it out either but you should understand...\" He trails off, he'd gotten better at being frank and honest with his feelings in recent years. Or more often than not his lack of feelings. \"When you met me I had no real grasp on what love was. What happened between us was... lust at least on my part. I could have potentially become something more I think but then you left. I am... not human. Not in the sense of my species but in the way I process and understand things. I am slowly learning just how skewed my emotions are thanks to what was done to me as a child.\"Shaking his head he shrugs his shoulders. \"I love my... our children.

I think I still have a lot of things to sort out and a few people I really should bury before I give thought to such matters again.\" That was it, the long and the short.

The answer has put a weight on her heart she did not expect, but she shrugs it off as quickly as it comes.She brightens again as her mind returns to her children, and the descriptions Alden provides.\"Lovely. How lovely. I cannot wait to see them again. Caleb and Kae particularly would make excellent warriors, I am certain. You can always tell from the time a kit is young whether their heart burns with the fire of Fitrr'azurr. Perhaps I could begin instructing them in the combative arts of our people. And the runt of the litter, the underdog, always the fiercest of the bunch. The girls sound like lovely kits in their own rights, too. I am glad you were a good father to them, Alden. I so wish I could have seen them grow like you have, but I will do my best to make up for lost time.\"She stands and moves over to her wagon, digging through her things to retrieve a roughspun blanket, wrapping it about her shoulders before moving back to sit by the fire again. It's getting late, and the chill of the night has begun to seep in, the stars twinkling gloriously overhead and the moon shining its pale light down upon the land.

And her fur is mussed up and dirty, despite her bathing in the streams beside the roads every now and again.\"But I will be at...uh...what was it...\" she pauses as she searches her memory.\"Ah, yes! 13 Riverside Drive, that was it.

She's back. After what feels like an eternity of being so, so far away, she'll be able to see her family -- her real family -- once again.
