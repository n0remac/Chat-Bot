Anyone who tried to enter the city through the aqueduct would surely be filtered out or drown.\u00a0Although many resources were spent to build the aqueduct, it seems to be mostly a thing of hygiene and comfort rather than a necessity. Indeed, wells and water from the river provide valuable drinking fluids should the aqueduct be destroyed.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://oi68.tinypic.com/2dj31jp.jpg"], "html": "At a slight decline, a great aqueduct of stone brings fresh water from the springs in the rocky hills west of Isra down across the plains and into the city itself; arching over a section of the western wall and delivering the liquid of life right into the heart of the city's water system.\u00a0"}}
