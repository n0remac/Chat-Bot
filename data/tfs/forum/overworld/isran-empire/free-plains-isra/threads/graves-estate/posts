It was much different than she remembered: darker, dirtier, overgrown. It was in a sad state.Looking to her side, she exchanged glances with Poala, who had woken up on the last day of the sail. \"Ready to meet grandma?\" she asked unsteadily, trying to smile for the child. Poala shuffled in place, breaking eyesight from Kauri. \"Yeah...\" the older chimera mumbled. \"Me too.\"Clopping across the stone veranda, ignoring the stench of the pond just beyond the doorstep, Kauri raised her hand, took a breath, then knocked.There was no answer.Frowning, the chimera reached for the doorknob, tarnished and oily, and twisted it. The door opened, but only after she leaned her shoulder against it. Dust flew down from the ceiling, causing both girls to explode in a flurry of sneezes. When the dust cleared, Kauri wiped her eyes and looked down the hall. She pulled Poala into the house, looking to the right, where the kitchen sat, and to the left, the dining room. From the back, before they could venture too far, a racket caught their attention from further inside the house.A weak \"Hello?\" reached their ears, causing Poala's to swivel atop her head. Kauri recognized it at once and began to canter down the hallway and up the stairs. Cobwebs clung to her face and she battled them all the way up to the solar.\"My, my, what a racket,\" said that soft, shaky voice again. Kauri paused at the door, clearing the last bit of cobweb from her eyes. When they were all gone, she was silent, voice caught in her throat.The solar used to be such a bright, cheery room. She spent much of her childhood inside, books stacked around her as she curled up near the fireplace, lost in the worlds presented to her with every written word. It was her favorite place to be, once upon a time, before she decided she wanted to explore those worlds she saw in the books.Now, it was as dusty as the rest of her house, no longer sunny for the mold and vines growing on the windows. There were no books. Everything was grey, save for the small embers glowing on the fire. In the middle of the room, there was a lone rocking chair, and on that chair sat an equally grey woman. She was twice Kauri's age and half her height slumped in that chair, swathed in a multitude of moth-eaten blankets. She was working on knitting something Kauri couldn't make out, but it drooped to the floor in a pile. She paused in her craft and looked up, staring at Kauri and Poala.\"... I don't think I was expecting visitors,\" she fussed. \"Who are you?\"Kauri felt her body shudder. Tears spilled from her eyes as she croaked, \"Mother?\"The silence in the room was palpable. Barely a breath was taken as the two women gazed into each other's eyes, realization filling the space between them. \"Katti?\"The chimera's approach was slow, almost fearful. She was so gentle with her steps that it seemed to take an eon to walk over to the older woman. When she was right in front of her, she knelt at her feet, then reached out to take her hand. \"Yes,\" the chimera whispered. \"Yes, mother, it's... it's me.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Kauri felt her knees tremble."}, "post-78728": {"user": "Kauri Graves", "user_num": 2656, "timestamp": "1516743235000", "message": "There had been a lot of tears between the two women, excited yelling followed by denial, then joy.

Are you alright?\"Kauri frowned, laying her head on her mother's lap. \"I... is it so repulsive to you? I mean... Poala was born this way. She's going to get the gems taken care of, but otherwise-\"\"Love, why are you asking me?\" the older woman argued. \"I have my daughter back, no matter what she looks like, but you hardly look comfortable in your new skin. You had a ritual there, you said. They gave you a new name. Doesn't look like you embraced it very well, though.\"Kauri frowned and leered at the floor. \"You're right, but... I don't know. Part of me really misses what I used to be, but I've been this way for years now-\"The chimera was cut off as the older woman put her hand on her cheek. \"That's not a decision you need to make right now. Honey, no matter what you choose, I'll always love you just the same.\" She turned her gaze lovingly to Poala, placing a kiss on her forehead. \"And the very same for you, too!\"This made Kauri smile, though she was still very conflicted. Still, her mother was right: she didn't have to choose now. \"So where's father? And Uriel?\" she asked, looking up at her mother expectantly. The old woman's brows wrinkled.\"Uriel left home two years ago, trying to earn money for the estate. He comes back, occasionally, but it's very painful for him. We neglected him for far too long.

Another pair of hooves joined to create a small stampede of noise. If the messenger boy peered inside, he'd see a young girl, perhaps no older than two, that was slightly similar to Kauri with her deerlike legs and eyes resembling a cat's. This one was even more confusing than the older chimera, however- she had stripes on her skin and spots in her hair, horns that curled around her head and feline ears that plopped up between them. Not only that, but gems were embedded in her skin, dotting the child's arms and neck. She was a complete mess, no rhyme or reason in her design. She came forth bearing a quill that Kauri had so desperately been stomping around for, which was accepted with a hasty thank you. She clopped back over to the messenger boy before searching for a surface to write on, choosing the door frame.

Children! Welcome! This is my parents, Marcus and Elaine, and also Poala.

Oh, how scared I was! And not just for myself, but for the little fae! I wasn't letting her go at all. I kicked and thrashed around until I almost couldn't breathe! I must have frightened the fish quite a bit. He bit off quite a bit more than he could chew, that one. He let me go, though I'd already almost run out of breath. The only thing I could do was hoist my arm back and toss the little fae back onto shore while I sank. And then... everything went dark.\"Turning the pages again, Kauri searched for another drawing, this one utilizing much more than quill and ink. This one had gentle water paints all over.\"But... eventually I woke up, and I wasn't inside that murky old pond at all. I'd been taken somewhere else entirely. A grove filled with all these beautiful flowers and... and little huts in the trees! Little people were riding songbirds all around. The songs they sang were enchanting. I immediately thought I'd died and gone to The Great Beyond. I'd never seen anything quite so beautiful before.\"______________The small child ran this way and that, leaping to impressive heights even when it looked like they'd thrown the disk too far above her head.
