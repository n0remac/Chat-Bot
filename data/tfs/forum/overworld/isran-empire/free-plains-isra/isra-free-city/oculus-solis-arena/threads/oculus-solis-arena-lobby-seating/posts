Without space enough to construct the arena within the city, a portion of the wall was demolished and the arena itself was incorporated into the wall itself. As such, the exterior walls are fortified with all of the same heavy defensive emplacements and enchantments as the other portions of the wall, and is patrolled by the same guardsmen. Entry into the arena is only possible from within Isra's walls, through one of several wide entry corridors.\u00a0After passing through the gates and the payment booth into the arena proper, one is greeted with a grand sight. Though not particularly ornate, decorated, or otherwise inherently pleasing to the eye, the sheer size of the interior of the Oculus Solis Arena is enough to take one\u2019s breath away. The most conservative of estimates would see thousands of long benches carved into the stone of the arena, all prepared to seat spectators. \u00a0When designing it, much thought was put into allowing as many individuals to see the arena floor as possible, and this is reflected in the tiered banks of seating, with successively higher and higher rows of benches, allowing each attendee to see over the head of those who are sitting before them. \u00a0Additionally, above the standard benched seating, special seating boxes are supported by pillars. These seating boxes are considerably more comfortable to sit in than the stone benches below, covered above by colorful cloth overhangs, and sporting varying degrees of more comfortable seating arrangements. Sofas, cushions, blankets, and in the case of the central, most prominent seating box, a throne, flanked on either side by long settees. \u00a0The arena floor itself is relatively unremarkable. A circular, flat expanse of sand- imported from some manner of desert, presumably. At the opposite horizontal axes of the arena, large entryways lead in from the East and West ready rooms, designed to allow even the largest of competitors to make their grand entries into the arena.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/mwXK52c.jpg", "http://i.imgur.com/bTBNZbp.png"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><font face=\"times new roman\"><img alt=\"http://i.imgur.com/mwXK52c.jpg\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/mwXK52c.jpg\" style=\"max-width:50%;\"/></font></div>"}, "post-38934": {"user": "Aegon", "user_num": 439, "timestamp": "1463971614000", "message": "The mystic Traveler arrived, his hood down and his magic cloaking off.

As Madame Naoki makes her way down the road toward the Oculus Solis Arena, her hair moves in tandem with the angle sleeve of her new dress, fluttering softly in the breeze. She glances up to see a smattering of clouds drifting across the sky. How pleasant it is to have warm weather for a change, and be able to wear warm weather clothing, she muses. Flanked to the right by Artemis   and to the left by a senior Sun Marshal, Naoki casually locates the end of the queue to enter the arena, and takes her place in line behind an elderly man, hands folded behind her back. A few curious glances are aimed in her direction, and murmurs sweep the crowd as it collectively becomes aware of her presence. It is somewhat strange to see the leader of one\u2019s government standing in line with the general citizenry, afrer all. She counters the stares with pleasant smiles and friendly ear twitches, acting for all the world to simply be yet another citizen, here to watch the matches. One flanked by uniformed guards, perhaps, but still. She could have rode in on a litter made of solid gold, this is quite humble.Eventually, the stares mostly break off, though a few rolling whispers persist as informed citizens point her out to their uneducated companions. Having not participated in very many public presentations, this is the first opportunity many of them have had to look upon her. However, her pleasant smile remains, mind far from the situation at hand; almost daydreaming. But the line moves forward at a steady pace, a testament to the staff administering the event. Before long, it is Naoki\u2019s turn to deposit nine silver coins in the admissions box; three each, for her and her companions. As the passes through the primary entrance from the interior of the city, the guards flanking the grand gate snap to a simultaneous salute, and she nods politely in response. After passing through the gates, she meanders away from the primary flow of foot traffic into the seating area of the area, off to the immediate left of the hallway. One of a few such alcoves off to either side of the primary thoroughfare, a pair of stone doors blend subtly into the floral detailing of the curved wall. It is up against one of these doors that Naoki leans, bending one knee to place the bottom of one espadrille up against the door, and crossing her arms beneath her chest. In this position, she settles in to wait, here, at their agreed-upon rendezvous point. Her company should be along shortly enough, and until then, Naoki will wait, the corners of her lips still turned slightly upward. The Sun Marshal assumes a position directly in the center of the alcove\u2019s entrance, a steely gaze sending gawkers on their way and scanning the passing crowd for individuals of interest.

A few apples, a pair of bananas, a small stack of mangos, exactly four pears, and a bunch of grapes.

Any excuse to fund a bit more of Kate to grab is solid enough in her book.

The only stairs up to their seating box are in the rear, and are not at all accessible to the vendor.

For the city, it\u2019s a sporting event that pleases the people, and the revenue generated from filling the arena\u2019s seats is not insignificant. But more than any of that, this match will be a statement of The Empire\u2019s strength. A flex of her metaphorical muscles. All who have ears to hear today\u2019s tale will know this: these are the powers Isra commands. To the everyman, to the citizen, it is an inspiring spectacle, showcasing the incredible talents of the living legends who stand in stalwart defense of everything they know. Not a soul in Isra fears for invading armies or rampaging monsters, for the beasts foolish enough to try have been struck down! To see these heroes in action is a grand performance, in which all Israns may take pride. To the enemy \u2014 to foreign upstarts, to the warlords, the bandits, and the criminal degenerates, it is an implicit threat.

One of the downsides of leading an unchallenged superpower is that opportunities to make use of its military might are limited. Very rarely do threats arise that justify the use of any real force, and the majority of what opportunities do emerge are more akin to sweeping than swordplay, Naoki thinks. No tests of skill. On only a few occasions has Naoki witnessed Jun in action, and Daedalus not at all. To truly know what each is capable of, they must face a challenge, and that is what Naoki hopes they will find here \u2014 in each other.
