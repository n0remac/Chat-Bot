Competitors enter through opposite entry tunnels on the east and west sides. At the beginning of each match, a match official stands in the center of the ring. The competitors are expected to make their entrances, approach the center, perhaps shake hands or something like that with their competitor, and await the mark of the match official to begin their fight. Standing in the center of the arena, Marceline has been again been chosen to officiate the match. As the competitors approach the ring, she introduces them, voice booming out from the golden rune cube held in her right palm.\u00a0\"In the west, it's\u00a0Lamina Manira !\"The crowd erupts into a respectful sort of din. Having already seen Lamina rip through a few unskilled opponents, she's visibly earned her spot here in the semi-finals.\u00a0\"And in the east, we have Aegon, Windwalker!\u00a0Again, the crowd cheers on Aegon as he enters the ring.
