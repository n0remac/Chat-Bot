As Solvictus made his way through the corridors to the gate, these sounds would grow louder and louder like a stampede of bulls charging at him. This tournament was a grand event for everyone, especially the competitors in the event. While some were here to represent a nation, others were here for themselves. Solvictus was one who came here for his own personal reasons.Solvictus, a dark mage from an unknown land, had never taken part in such a tournament before. The battles among his people in a coliseum were fueled by criminals and slaves who fought to the death for their chance at freedom. Solvictus had always found himself spectating these events, wondering what it would be like to be a gladiator in such a brutal sport, Darkness fueled this desire to prove himself among this new world and fulfill a childhood dream. Thoughts on this fight filled his mind like the What If game, constantly running scenarios in his mind, trying to stay focused on the fight.The thoughts would keep flowing, slowing down as Solvictus laid eyes on the white and golden rays of light piercing through opening in his gate. His mind shifted from the thousands of plots and plans in his head to the glorious arena that rested before him on the other side of the light. The sands glistened like small shards of glass from the view within the shadows, casting their rays on the stone architecture that stood as the arena walls. His ears would take in the roar of the crowds as it fueled him like a methamphetamine. His mind was currently lusting after the desires of the crowd, to see who is the most talented mage. The closer he got, the more his mind started to focus, but it was still not focused completely on battle. In the back of his mind, Solvictus knew a loss didn't mean to make an enemy of this person, but another chance to learn.From the pits of shadows within the gate, two glowing red orbs illuminated like a demons eyes. As Solvictus entered into the light, the demonic red glow would turn into two Brick Red irises that were slitted like a predators, producing a slight glowing effect within the shadows of his helm. After two steps into the sunlight, the full 6'8\" mage figure was completely outside his gate free from the grasps of the shadows.The sands would cast double the light on the armor and silks Solvictus was wearing when he first exited his gate, temporarily preventing the crowd or his competitor from viewing his actual form. The first rays repelled off of Solvictus like he was a diamond, reflecting in multiple colors instead of the basic white glare of normal armors and cloths. Once the eyes  of the spectators adjusted to the glistening light on the magical iron armor, they would rest their oculars on the dark mage known as Solvictus who was hidden behind this glare. The most noticeable article to be seen by the crowds on Solvictus was his red hood made from fine silks and hemp. Hidden within the majestic red hood was a magical iron helm that used a skeletal mask that was bonded to his head. The helm itself has magical properties that prevent the head from taking excessive damage from magic and certain weapons should they be used in this fight.The upper body was also adorned by an  iron armor with the same magical properties as the helm. This armor was plated to look like a muscular build and minimizing any hindrance in upper body movements. His upper torso would be more resistant to damage taken from magical attacks while wearing this upper body armor. This armor, like the helm, has a smokey grey color.Attached to this armor is a set of red sleeves that hide the arms of Solvictus. These sleeves have cloths weaving around them for decoration. These cloths are outlined with a golden silk to give them a magical and quality appearance. Adorning his lower torso is a pair of red pants and strands of cloths that form an ornamental skirt. These garments would hide the legs and feet of Solvictus as he moved deeper into the arena. From the top of his hood, to the base of his feet, Solvictus was covered. Even after removing most of his armor, Solvictus still carried his menacing demonic appearance. The armors design wreaked of Darkness, but the magic that fueled the enchantments told the tale. The presence of the dark being within these demonic garments would send a message to any competitor he faced in this tournament or in the world outside the stone walls of this coliseum.In the grasp of the right hand of Solvictus was a scepter that also stood as a two dual bladed axe head on each end of it, making this scepter a lethal weapon in close range combat. This axe scepter was one meter in length, made of iron, and crafted in the demonic style of his armor. The blades on the axes were designed for breaking armor and causing severe physical damage under the correct circumstances. Solvictus was not trained very well for close range combat with this weapon but he did know the basics. Solvictus used this weapon for the magical capabilities it possessed and when close range combat occurred, Solvictus had to rely on his moderate hand to hand combat skills to guide his weapon. When Solvictus reached fifteen meters from his gate, he stopped. His head would turn to the crowds and gaze upon them like he was in the middle of million gold pieces. As his head moved through the crowds, his body moved with it so he could view everything around him. Beneath the magical helm Solvictus had a smile on his face as he fed on their primitive behaviors and his own desires. He was an unknown to these people, but they cheered as if they placed large bets on him. To be at the epicenter of this attention bestowed upon him one of the mightiest of feelings, and the more they cheered, the more he was fueled for this fight. The cheers for blood were like throwing gasoline on a fire to Solvictus.\u00a0When the time came, Solvictus would stop his crowd gazing and focus on his opponent. Beneath the skirt of cloths a motion occurred that placed his feet shoulder length apart. His chest would slightly puff out as he lowered his head. With his head lowered, the hood cast a shadow over the eyes of the skull mask revealing the same red glow that had in the shadows of the gate. To finish off the stance preparation, Solvictus lowered the top ax blade of his scepter to point at the ground in front of him and the bottom blade raising to point behind Solvictus slightly above the gate he hailed from.Solvictus raised his left hand into the air towards his opponent, \"Hail wah Faal Vuloh\", greeting him as he would any from his home land. When he finished his words, he lowered his left arm slowly. He flipped his hand and arm over while balling a fist at the same time. Once the forearm was up and his fist balled, the fist found itself located inches from his ribs showing the cloths that formed gloves that clung to Solvictus knuckles like an extra skin.\u00a0As the red orbs made their illuminating presence, the mind of Solvictus became focused on one thought; defeat his opponent. The roar of the crowd turned into a soft hum within his eardrums. The light became focused as if time itself slowed down in Solvictus's mind. The beads of sweat that formed beneath the garments of Solvictus rolled down across his skin cooling him until they were soaked into his cloths to act like a wet cloth keeping him cool. With every gust of air Solvictus would get a sensational feeling that would rejuvenate him while cooling him. The battle had not started, but Solvictus was ready, having complete faith his abilities.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The crowds roared with bloodlust as the next competitors would arrive from the darkness of their gates.

Solvictus remained at a fair distance of thirty-five meters from his opponent creating a range that would require a ranged magic attack or charging on foot. As the announcer gave the signal to officially begin, Solvictus began to work his dark magics. The red lining on his armor began to flash light a light being turned on and off.

She stands in the middle of the ring as the competitors approach, her rune-cube held in her right hand, eyeing each of them up, placing her internal bets.The blue one. 'Satrage ', she had been told. He\u2019s not the most readable sort, she muses. She was informed of the information he placed down on the registration form, but you can\u2019t really tell from looking, she muses. It\u2019ll be interesting to see the full extent of his magic. And then the other competitor. She turns to glance in Solvictus \u2019 direction\u2026 to see him surrounded in darkness, channeling magic of some sort of magic. You what. There has been no gong sound. She did not signal to start the fight. This is a false start. Marceline\u2019s tongue runs along her upper lip as she realizes just what this means. Without any change in posture or warning, two golden chains erupt from the cube held in her right hand. Defying all standard laws of how chains ought to work, they grow and snake outward from the cube like a pair of eels, taking just a moment to orient themselves before crossing the gap between the palm of Marceline\u2019s hand and solvictus in a matter of moments. Upon reaching his figure, they waste no time in wrapping themselves around his form in countless loops. Arms, legs, torso; one loop even wraps itself directly around his neck.After solidifying their hold, the chains begin to retract, pulling their captive across the sandy ground back toward the center of the ring with no pretense of gentleness. In a matter of moments, solvictus is lying on his side squarely at Marceline\u2019s feet, the majority of his form covered by the countless links of chain. With a small smirk, Marceline bends at the knees, resting her upper arms on her knees as she bends down to look down on solvictus. As match referee, she stands as the unequivocal arbiter of the arena. Her word is law, she is the ultimate authority, and any attempt to subvert her will through magics or brute physicality will be met with insurmountable matching force. It is in this power, this position of dominance, that Marceline truly comes into her own.\u201cFalse start, honey. The gong didn\u2019t ring. Fight doesn\u2019t start \u2018til the gong rings.

He would accept the consequences without fighting against these chains himself.The Dark magic had a way of responding without his control. As the chains made their way for him to bind him, the chains would be met by the Darkness. As the cube has created these chain, the Darkness created an automatic response to protect Solvictus. The black miasma began interweaving with these chains to keep them off of Solvictus's body. His armor stood as a defense itself, knocking the chains capabilities down by 30% which allowed the Darkness to inflict it's own damage if the chains were not returned to their master.\"I do not wish to violate your rules, but your aggression to stop me is not needed. Return your chains and we will fight under your rules.\" Solvictus spoke in a deep growl.Under certain circumstances the magic Solvictus had drawn on to create the transparent miasma around him began to subside till he returned to normal stance like his opponent. Even with his magic level lowered to prevent further altercations, the Darkness would continue to interweave with the magical chains, tainting their abilities and slowly weakening them.
