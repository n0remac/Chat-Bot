Untroubled, he sighed in quiet contentment, thoughts turning inwards.It had been nearly two weeks since Falcon had last found a chance to relax and enjoy his surroundings.  The man had been traveling non-stop - from one town to the next, a nameless village to another, a capital here, a mountain's peak there; by the end of several months, Falcon was certain he'd wandered across half the continent he'd recently begun to call a temporary home.  Although he frequently ceased his aimless vagrancy to garner some much-needed rest (in the interest of continuing on even further in the future), this time fate had seemingly conspired against him.As the man warmed up in the corner of the arena, his sheer, blissful contentment at going through a round of stretching combated the uncomfortable flashes of memory he experienced as he recalled the last month.  Mentally, he ticked off the events that had driven him nearly ragged.First, he'd had a run-in with a small-time group of bandits.  They'd ambushed him in the middle of the night, and although his normal recourse would have been to leave them in the ground, strange lands called for strange recourse - and so he'd merely bound them and left them in the forest.  Then, his food supplies had spoiled unexpectedly, leaving him several days short on rations and forcing him to take a few odd jobs to pay for several days' worth of victuals before he could undertake a proper quest and earn himself some real coin.  Finally, and most troubling of all, he'd received word from home.Falcon sighed, looking up briefly, noting a blurry figure approaching from across the arena.  Although he was too far to discern much, he noted the figure's slim nature, the slight sway of the hips, the squared shoulders...likely female.  Armed, too.  The warrior shrugged, storing the information in the back of his mind as \"knowing who has a weapon near you\" before returning to his inner musings.The word from home had been...concerning, to say the least.  Generally, he knew his people would hold their own against the apocalypse itself should it knock upon their gates, but--a tiefling?!Falcon's head whipped up, eyes widening.  By now, the figure had walked closer, and Falcon's profound sense of magic had enveloped them like a light blanket, feeding him information that caused the hair on his forearms to stand up in wariness.  He decided to leave his weapon where it lay in his bag for now, instead choosing to rise from his crouch and pace forwards to meet the oncoming figure.  He brushed at his thick black hair, frowning, head tilting in equal parts curiosity and concern.  Before the two had closed within twenty meters of each other, Falcon stopped, keeping the same neutral pose.

It had been a long, *long* time since anyone had called him weak.  Before he could remind himself that this wasn't his homeland, and he wasn't a known figure, he flexed his fingers as his signature magic roared along his frame in a sudden burst of fiery blue light.  Surrounded as he was by arcana of massive power, he eyed the woman in front of him even as the energy began to sink into his bones in a familiar, soothing ritual.  Spell after spell layered itself automatically on him, boosting his every aspect of his senses, physicality, and more, wrapping him protectively in their embrace as the threads wove themselves into his very being.  Before long, the effect had lost its visual aspect, the fires dying down to mere pinpricks of light that shivered along his frame in ecstatic flickers.  Falcon now presented a much more dangerous figure, having enchanted himself with enough magic that one could easily detect him nearly a mile away.  To any with the ability to sense such arcana, they would nearly be blinded after a moment's glance towards the warrior.

When the demonic side of her blood wrested control from her conscious mind- particularly out of defense instinct because of some strong enemy- the sheer instinctual destructive urge was so overwhelming it, effectively 'shorted out' her consciousness. All that was left was the beast that would not stop till the threat was neutralized or it was. Very dimly and distantly, she felt the thrill of adrenaline and the sick joy as she had the impudent human against the wall, bombarded from all sides. Her bloodlust reached it's peak as finally her sword hit home lodging into the humans' abdomen, and she poured the barely contained lightning into the man's form. It was whatever humanity that managed to claw it's way to the surface that stopped the angle of penetration from striking his heart. And that was likely what saved him. The thick scent of blood on the air, pleased her demon but made her humanity recoil and reel back in horror and disgust- waking from the daze. As Falcon summoned his last resort, Amaya had actually retreated inward battling with herself for control once more. Her humanity- crying, begging, and pleading that they had already done more than enough. Her demoness- reeling with laughter and bloodthirst, wanting to finish the job they'd already started for the man's impudence. Both sides equally strong- equally balanced, but unable to wrest complete control from the other. It was not until she was struck by a wind not her own that both sides snapped back to attention, noting the magic radiating from the man. It was a deep ominous building pressure on Amaya's senses. Her grip on her sword tightened again, refocusing as one could not argue with themselves when they were already passed but the tip of her sword lowered only moments later at his murmur. She barely caught it over her storm that had begun to still, but still it was there. And moments later the blood thirst was gone and replaced with guilt as the man collapsed, blood pouring from the wound she'd inflicted. The pupils and irises slowly reappeared in her eyes as she regained herself, dropping her bloodied sword in her hurry. She'd done it again. \"Damn it.\" She hissed as she leapt into motion.She took a step and pulled the winds towards herself to quickly cross the expanse of the arena, her hand going to rifle in the concealed pocket to her armor. Amaya dropped down onto her knees beside him as she pulled out a tiny vial which she swiftly uncorked. Unknown in the Mainland, and decently rare even in her homeland- she'd finally wizened up and begun bringing Elixir with her. The cost to make, use, and administer was high, so it was typically a last resort... but considering the number she'd done on the man, she couldn't very well just walk away. Fly, maybe, but her wings were still sore. Careful not to use even half a drop too much, she let a good sized drop fall from the vial into the wound she'd inflicted on him. If Falcon was even still capable of feeling in his state, he'd feel warmth spread throughout the wound as the medicine did as it was supposed to, slowly easing the bleeding and working on mending the rend in his abdomen. \"A lucky ass, you are.\" She grumbled as she popped the cork back on. She could only hope she hadn't wasted a use. \"I tried to warn you.\" She said huffing in annoyance as she straightened up again, rolling her shoulders, glaring down at the man.

I didn't even think... it was possible for a human to actually contain a deity and remain in their right mind.\" She idly thought to the only other circumstance that was even slightly similar that she'd encountered. She could only hope there was no consciousness remaining in that shell. She shook herself from those musings exhaling slowly before she turned to address him again. \"If you miss it so, why don't you return? I will probably be going home soon, for instance.\" She glanced around at the street seeing several hanging signs advertising what looked to be taverns, drinking halls and eateries. Not being from the area she didn't quite know which would be any good so she merely decided on one at random that looked not to be as shifty as the others.  She started off towards the 'Silver Dragon Sanctuary'.
