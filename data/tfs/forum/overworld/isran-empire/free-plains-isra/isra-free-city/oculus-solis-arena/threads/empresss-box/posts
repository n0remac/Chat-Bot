Here, The Empress may sit as to better see and be seen. From it, she can see almost every part of The Arena, and vice versa. At the edge, there is a balcony, The Balcony, from which The Empress might address her subjects and observe the festivities. But further back, depressed into the floor\u2014out of view of the plebs, the interior of The Box is arranged almost as a sitting room might be. There is a plethora of cushioned seating options, tables, floral arrangements, and even a few bookshelves. An entire team of pageboys stands ready with fruit, drinks, fans, and other instruments of pampering. Additionally, Imperial Sentinels are stationed on, throughout, and around The Box. It is host to a great many protective enchantments and runes, in the event that something untoward might try to happen.

There was a bench nearby, where she took her perch, laying on her side with one wing tucked, the other splayed against her body.The garments she had been given to wear around Isra were strange, but only because she was unused to wearing any at all. Mostly silks, the dresses were made to bellow impressively in the wind as she flew, but also to drape in a way that her frame was apparent beneath. They never had a back, leaving her wings free, though a hefty amount of ribbons dyed red and gold were added to her hair and sometimes caught onto her feathers. They still had a few things to figure out with the designs, but overall, the bird was pleased.She waited for Naoki, choosing not to speak to the guards. They were all boorish and unamusing anyway.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Being able to fly was useful, but Khepri thought that perhaps it was more useful in cities than anywhere else, what with its busy roads and mazelike walls everywhere.

Below, the people of Isra continue to stream in under the watchful eye of The Guard, each depositing the requisite 5 copper fee as they pass through the gate. By the sound of it, the arena is perhaps half full, but The Empress knows it won\u2019t stay that way for long because today is race day.Arriving at her box, The Empress proceeds directly to the front, where she can for the first time see down into the arena. Placing her hands gingerly upon the railing, she looks out. \u2026 Her guess about the seating was good.The roar of the crowd falters, and there is a great deal of pointing and saluting as The Empress is noticed, followed by cheering. For this day of all days, The Empress wears neither red nor gold but a silken cloak of brilliant white, which, though not quite her color, symbolizes neutrality and does well to keep her cool under the blazing summer sun. The Empress raises her hand beatifically in greeting to the crowd and stands there for a moment more, looking this way and that as they cheer. As the noise begins to subside she returns to her box.Coming down the stairs, Naoki blinks a few times as her eyes readjust to the shade. Around her, the pages have finished their preparations, which essentially amount to the artful presentation of fresh fruit and preparation of large leaves to be used for fanning. They stand in an orderly line along the wall, and Sentinels have taken up their positions replacing the previous guards. All is in order... And Khepri is here.
