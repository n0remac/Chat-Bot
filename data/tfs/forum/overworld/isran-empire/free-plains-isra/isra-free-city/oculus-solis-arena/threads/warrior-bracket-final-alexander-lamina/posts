To get to this point, both fighters have demonstrated their prowess with the blade, and as such, this match ought to be something of a spectacle. Either that or a unilateral stomp. But that would still be a spectacle, the crowd supposes. Regardless, Marceline the referee takes to the grand stage after both of the competitors seem to be about finished with their grandstanding. Seeing as how Lamina is closer to the center, her enchantments are checked over first, Marceline\u2019s cube spinning about Lamina\u2019s petite figure for the space of a few moments, and finding everything to be in order. A beckoning hand draws Alexander from his position near the gate toward the center- Marceline isn\u2019t walking all the way over there. Once he\u2019s within twenty meters or so of the center, his enchantments are checked as well and found to be functioning properly. With the enchantments checked and the competitors standing roughly twenty meters apart, there is no reason to delay the start of the match any longer.
