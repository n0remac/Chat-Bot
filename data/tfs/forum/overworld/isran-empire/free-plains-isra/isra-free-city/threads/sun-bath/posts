Evoking a similar Ionic style to that of its neighbor, stairs that run the entire length of the building lead up to a portico featuring a smattering of assorted tables and chairs. Due to the way the building is oriented, the portico is almost continually in the sun, and as such, individuals can be found lounging upon it more or less continuously throughout the day, sunbathing, reading, socializing, and such.\u00a0If one were to view the building from above, immediately obvious would be the portion of The Grand Aqueduct running directly into the building. Using wells to obtain the amount of water necessary to run the establishment would be highly impractical, so Norkari Mountain spring water is used instead.\u00a0In the center of the portico, sturdy double doors lead\u00a0inward, to a largely circular area that might be best described as the lobby. In the center of this lobby, a marble statue stands on a raised dais. The statue is about seventeen feet tall (interestingly enough, a scale model exactly three times the size of the genuine article), highly detailed and accurate, and depicts none other than everyone\u2019s favorite democratically elected High Lady Naoki. This statue is dressed as one might be as they are approaching a bath. Which is to say, in not much. A towel wrapped about under the armpits, a pair of bathing sandals, and a somewhat lecherous smirk, as the statue eyes up all who enter through the principal entrance.\u00a0Along the front of the dais, a quote is printed:\u00a0I\u2019m financing this personally, and I make no pretense of being modest, so we are putting a statue of me in the front room, right here\u2026~High Lady Naoki, on the construction of this building\u00a0The lobby\u2019s floor is tiled in such a way that there is an image of Isra\u2019s sun insignia on the floor, with rays of light in yellow and orange tiles radiating outward from the center/the statue.\u00a0Off to one\u2019s right and left, wide hallways lead off, which stretch all the way to the far walls of the building. Along these hallways, pillar-like protrusions from the walls on both sides form recesses, and within these recesses, one might find a window, a door leading inward to a bathing room, or a small seating area.\u00a0Leading directly ahead, another similar, although shorter hallway leads directly inwards, and it is flanked on either side by two straight staircases which lead up to a sort of balcony which looks down on the lobby. Extending back from this balcony is another very similar hallway, though it is on the second floor, directly above the one below. All around the lobby, there are signs, proclaiming the hallway leading to the left to be \u201cWomen,\u201d and the hallway to the right to be \u201cMen.\u201d\u00a0Around the edge of the lobby, more seating areas can be found, as well as a handful of desks. At these desks, apparent employees of the bath house stand, with the intention to answer questions, give directions, and dispense towels and bathing sandals.\u00a0One would find that the left wing of the building is intended solely for women, for reasons that ought to be obvious. There are only fives entrances from the hallway, and they all lead into very similar rooms: rooms intended for undressing. These feature benches, boxes to store one\u2019s belongings in, additional supplies of towels, bathrobes, and bathing sandals, and other such things one might need. From these undressing rooms, many doors and miniature hallways are available. Large doors with signs indicate the hot bath, the warm bath, the cold bath, and sauna. Beyond these primary rooms, a multitude of smaller, more specialized or personal rooms exist and are also labeled. If one would simply like to bathe in a tub by themselves, that is an option. If one would like a massage, that can be provided for a fee. Similarly, if one would like to bathe in water hot enough to seriously scald human skin, that is also an option. Throughout, female employees are scattered, to attend to needs, answer questions, and the like.\u00a0The men's area is on the other side of the building and is identical in almost every way, save for being laid out differently on account of being mirrored, and with male attendants.\u00a0It is in the upper and lower central hallways that things have the potential to get interesting, as this is the private/optionally mixed bathing area. Both the left and right sides of the lower hallway have a hot, warm, and cold bath, as well as several small group sized rooms with variable temperatures and more elaborate/specialized bathing areas. These include baths suited for those Isran citizens that aren\u2019t quite humanoid, such as dwarves, centaurs, assorted quadrupeds, and other such individuals with very particular needs. The upper hallway features almost exclusively private baths, the use of which can be secured by creating an appointment with and paying a fee to an employee.\u00a0At the rear of the building, there is a fair amount of backend and utility work that is done. Primarily, the heating of water is a very major part of running the establishment. To accomplish this, several large furnaces are kept lit throughout the day, burning large quantities of wood. The fumes from these flames are fanned, directed to flow beneath the floors of the appropriate bathing rooms, and pulled upward through flues embedded into the walls, before being merged back together and expelled toward the rear of the building. This method of heating keeps the floors and walls warm, while not utilizing any magic or allowing smoke into the rooms.\u00a0Read The Sun Bath\u2019s regulations here.", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/2165/library-isra", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/997/grand-aqueduct", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/user/607", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/2359/sun-bath-information-regulations"], "image_list": [], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">Sitting adjacent to <a href=\"http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/2165/library-isra\" rel=\"norewrite\" target=\"_blank\">The Library of Isra</a> in the heart of downtown Isra, there is a shorter, wider, but equally grandiose building: The Sun Bath.

Had she made a mistake? Looking down at the brief note clutched in her hand, she frowned.Sun Bath. Noon.The Empress' seal finished off the rather brief note, which a page boy had given her just a few hours before. Robert had left for work, and Dixie was just getting ready to head out to visit Roxanne when the boy had delivered the message. Now she was here, and was unsure as to what to do. Suddenly noticing the towering statue of the Empress herself, Dixie paused, gazing up at it. The sculptors had done well in their detail, and she wondered exactly how far the attention to detail had gone as her eye lingered on the hem of the carved towel. Of course, if the note was what she thought it was, there was no reason to be staring at the statue. She walked up to the desk, folding the note away so that the seal could not be seen.\"Hello? Um...do I have a reservation here? My name's Dixie...\"The attendant frowned for a moment, before flipping through the book of appointments. Pulling out a slip of paper, he scrutinized it for a moment before glancing back up at Dixie, then down at her chest, then back up at her hair. Apparently satisfied that she fit the description on the reservation, he nodded and beckoned for her to follow. He led her up to the upper hallway, and all the way to a particular room. Once he started back downstairs, Dixie stepped inside.To say the bath was luxurious would be an understatement. Magnificent, perhaps. Maybe even opulent\u00a0would be more appropriate. How much had the marble cost, Dixie wondered. What tropical ocean had the sponges been picked from? Who would have thought that a mere towel rack would need to be inlaid with a tasteful amount of gold? This single, steamy room was likely more valuable than the entire little town she grew up in, and she loved\u00a0it. Nothing said splendor like the crystal-clear, lavender-scented water, and no amount of rough-hewn blankets and straw mattresses could ever make her feel this pampered. Slipping off her clothes and folding them neatly on the rack, she sat down on the edge of the bath, dipping her legs into the water. Satisfied that the temperature was just right, she slid fully into the bath, sitting down on the smooth marble seat built into the wall.
