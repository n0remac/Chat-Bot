The result was a wide, sturdy bangle made of metal, with a hinge and a clasp that would allow it to be easily removed but make it look seamless when worn. There were runes etched across its surface as well.

Making a giant item for a giant creature to make things bigger so that she would consume less resources. It was brilliant, actually, and would be quite the challenge. Leaning forward to better peer at the diagram made by the exotic female, Liv tapped thoughtfully at her lower lip with the tip of her index finger as she pondered.<br><br/><font color=\"996633\">\"Well, somethin' that size would be awfully hard to transport.. so to start I could make it smaller, but activatin' it with mana channeled into a certain rune would make it the size that it could be worn by your giant friend. Maybe a bracelet of some sort so she won't risk droppin' it. And I can inscribe other runes into it that'll allow her to make stuff bigger with a focused application of mana.\"</font> She pulled a pencil out of a nearby cup and grabbed a piece of parchment from beneath the counter, quickly sketching out a design for the item she had in mind.
