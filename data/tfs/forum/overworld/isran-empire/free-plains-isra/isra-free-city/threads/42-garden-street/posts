Simply because a being is feeling despair and anger does not necessarily mean that they are a good person, or aren\u2019t dangerous. I advise you not to be quite as quick as you seem to be about forming feelings over a being you have so little information about.\u201d\u201cAdditionally, this seems highly suspicious to me, even beyond the possibility of the\u00a0individual\u00a0in question being... unsavory.

Gasping for breath, she clenched her hands into fists, her lower lip trembling as she struggled against the urge to touch him. Her mind was in a turmoil, her thoughts whirling madly, struggling against her heart for control. Unable to think clearly, words began to tumble from her lips, filled with anguish.\"This. This is why my heart aches, why my spirit drowns in sorrow. I just want to be close to you, to hold you and kiss you and see you smile.. but you kiss me, and you weep. How can I offer my heart to you when my touch drives you to tears? And I know they're not tears of joy. I can nearly taste your pain, Zaor.\" She heaved a sobbing breath, trying to ignore the ache of tears she couldn't shed which filled her vacant eye sockets, and lowered her head, sending snowy strands tumbling forward to half-hide her face. \"How can I not be full of sadness, knowing that my desire to be close to you is hurting you?

I don't...\"</font> <i>I can't tell you what's wrong..

And then she received it, Zaor's thumb stroking across her cheek, and she breathed a soft sound that was a mixture of anguish and satisfaction. Why was he torturing her like this? Could he not see how her heart cried out for him? His words only made it worse. What did he mean? He could see..? Panic filled her. He <i>knew</i> that she wanted him?<br><br/>She made a choked sound, words cut off before they could fully form, and made to step back, needing to flee from him, to go somewhere safe and hide the wounds in her heart. But before she could move, he was kissing her. A shudder wracked her entire body, and her limbs moved without her permission, the hand in his hair moving to curl over the back of his neck, while her other arm slid around his waist, pulling her body closer to his. She kissed him with all that she was, feeling her tender heart hesitantly reaching toward him, like a new blossom in the first rays of dawn.<br/><br/>And then she felt his tears falling against her skin. They burned like fire, and although she wanted nothing more than to keep kissing him, she knew she couldn't. Not when the very act made him weep. A purely sorrowful whimper was wrenched from her as she broke the kiss, and it took all of her will to pull her touch away from his body and step away from him. Gasping for breath, she clenched her hands into fists, her lower lip trembling as she struggled against the urge to touch him. Her mind was in a turmoil, her thoughts whirling madly, struggling against her heart for control. Unable to think clearly, words began to tumble from her lips, filled with anguish.<br/><br/><font color=\"725296\">\"<i>This.</i> This is why my heart aches, why my spirit drowns in sorrow. I just want to be close to you, to hold you and kiss you and see you smile.. but you kiss me, and you <i>weep</i>. How can I offer my heart to you when my touch drives you to tears? And I know they're not tears of joy.

The same dream, the same vision - every night. And every morning he woke from it, to find the woman of the vision lying in the bed beside him.This morning, it led him to think. Deeply. He carefully sat up in the bed and shifted his legs over the side to settle his feet flat upon the floor, leaning over to rest his elbows upon his knees and his chin upon his folded hands as he retreated into his own thoughts. His mind had been more clear now than it had in a long time. He was almost perfectly certain this was a vision granted by something unforseen... perhaps from Mivian herself. This thought brought a sad smile to his lips. If this was truly word from her spirit...It sounded just like her, just as Takhana had said. She wouldn't wish anyone to suffer. She wouldn't want him to ache, but to be happy. It was what she always wished, for him and every subject under her rule and care.His head would turn to peer at the Drowish woman lying in bed, his smile soft and heartfelt now. He... he wanted to do something by her. But what could he do? Everything was still odd... outside the door of this lovely home was an unfamiliar world. The longer he stared at her sleeping form, the faster did his mind begin to turn.Tea. Something simple. And... perhaps wander the kitchen for an inspiration. It had been... goodness, how many years since he had dabbled in a kitchen? But maybe he could prepare something for her.Before he left the bedroom, he would reach for the small pile of his remaining clothes - his shirt, vest, the greaves, the cape - and drew the folded cloak with his royal mark from the bottom. His steps were as quiet as he could manage as he moved around the bed to where she lay. He let the material fall open and draped it over her figure, carefully tucking her in with it and stroking the length of her gorgeous snow white hair a few times before he left the bedroom for the kitchen downstairs.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<"}, "post-47119": {"user": "Takhana Veil", "user_num": 1067, "timestamp": "1471806330000", "message": "Takhana was normally a very light sleeper - wandering alone and blind for many years meant you had to be alert and ready to defend yourself from an attack. But living in Isra had dulled that old instinct, and especially with Zaor at her side, she slept deeply. She didn't stir when he moved to sit on the edge of the bed, or when he stood. But when he draped his cloak over her form, she unconsciously burrowed her face into it, drawing the fabric around her sheet-covered body and breathing a contented sigh as the scent of him filled her sleeping thoughts. As such, she continued to sleep for a bit longer, until the usual morning wake-up occurred: Jean-Claude came bolting into the room and jumped up onto the bed with a curious meow, running up to the pillow to nuzzle her face and lick her nose until she woke with a grumble.\"You're so spoiled, you ball of fluff...\" Still, she pulled the cat in and cuddled him for a few moments, nuzzling him and stroking his fur - which led the feline to purr happily, until he finally wriggled away and escaped, launching himself off the bed with another meow. This was a plaintive one, asking for food, and Takhana sighed a laugh. Reaching toward the other side of the bed, she felt Zaor gone, with only the lingering traces of his warmth present.
