It would serve food usually found in Gauldin, high quality, small and very nutritious, as well as vending pastries and drinks for those who are too busy to eat now. He lives here too, and will not shy away from putting up a little music. Francois is open to advertising for others, always willing to go for a chat. Outside stands a single box magically enchanted so people can put in coins for charity, and those that honestly need them can open it and take them. If nobody takes them then Fran\u00e7ois takes them out himself and finds someone in need of food to give them to. He is also looking to hire performers to play. When performers are not available a small magical box plays music off of a black discus with various sigils and glyphs on it. It uses a series of jade and obsidian cubes to spread the sound hammered into the magical disc, which itself is an echo of the memories of Francois and various patrons. There is no clear menu, the owner is still learning of Isran cuisine, but will try to appease customers no matter what they order. Often he will ask for instructions on how to prepare something he has not heard of but will follow them precisely to the letter only at times adding a personal touch. He will have nearly any ingredient found in the overworld for such is the way of the man. Under his counter is also a year old baguette, specially dried and prepared to as to crush bones if needed, and an ancient crossbow is always loaded. The building has a small brewery in the cellars, and a workshop at the very back. It has a backdoor connecting to the alleyways, while sewers can be accessed from getting to the sub-basement bellow the cellars and opening a trapdoor. Finally, a simple redwood staircase going to the second floor of the building leads one to the bedroom or office of Francois.The schedule is as follows:Monday 9:30 AM - 10 PMTuesday 9:30 AM- 10 PM (11:30 AM - 1:30 PM the poor can come for free meals) Wednesday - 9:30 AM - 10:00 \u00a0PMThursday - 6:30 PM - 1:00 AMFriday - Closed for all but those with reservations.Saturday - 9:30 AM - 11 PM (timetable can be modified for those with parties and plans)Sunday - Closed for all but those with reservations. There is a note that explicitly states unless reservations are present, one should check in the morning to see if the Cafe might be closed for personal reasons. However anyone who can provide proof they were going to visit the Cafe on a closed day is entitled to a free reservation for a future date. In addition, those who cannot find work, home, food, or shelter are free to eat, rest, and regather their strength in his cafe.

He had only been a monster shortly so he wouldn't know.\"Mr. Zeldason..!\" Raynard opted for and slightly reluctantly handed his new employer his palm for a shake. \"What a pity with The Midnight Sun, I really liked that place and all that death is so tragic.\" Raynard commented trying to strike conversation as a human instead of pretending he knew whatever monster-lingo existed. Maybe this evening was for them to get better acquainted on those terms? Anyway Raynard would sit down with hands on his lap smiling politely if looked at. Did they drink anything? Was it good manners to be the first to order a beer or should he wait?", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Raynard stepped into the caf\u00e9 as apparently death had changed the plans quite severely and he wondered if there were monsters behind the attack on The Midnight Sun. It was hard to grasp that he was officially 'one of them' now and he found himself wanting to confirm if it could really be true but refrained from doing something that would put him in such a light. He wasn't stupid - Mr. Zeldason had already said yes but still his own self doubt had lingered and haunted him the last couple of days. How was he going to greet Mr. Zeldason and the others? Did monsters have specific things to talk about that humans didn't? He had only been a monster shortly so he wouldn't know."}, "post-88461": {"user": "Marlowe H.

Sighing, Marlowe spotted Chauncey and Raynard - a stranger Marlowe didn't recognize - not too far from the entrance, and approached the duo. \"Mr. Zeldason,\" Marlowe greeted, in his usual quiet rasp. \"I came as soon as I could.\" He was ever appreciative of the hospitality Chauncey had shown him and quickly fell asleep on the first bed that's been available to him and soundly slept through to the next day, oversleeping. That's the one reason he didn't show up with Chauncey.  He turned to the other man, Raynard, and held out his own hand. \"I do not believe we have had the pleasure.

Picking up a plate and wiping the table down he at last looked up smiled, walking back behind his counter to get ready to serve the men. They were clearly guards or other (para?)military members of some sort, although he did raise an eyebrow as he overheard them speak. The rasp of the bandaged man was off-putting and he wondered what was so vile it had to be bandaged to hide from all, but he was neither a judging nor a prying man and thus let him be. Placing the detritus of his last service in its proper little section he patted himself down of dust and then walked over to the trio that had come in to his establishment. As he spoke they would be able to note a slight accent on his voice, but a speech that was a cheery but mannered baritone. \"Hello gentlemen, my name is Francois Nicolet Montcalm, shall you be dining at a table or at the bar today?\" Dark eyes met the not quite human gazes with eagerness to serve and please, and once they replied he would lead them to wherever they decided they would sit. After that he produced a small paper and a feather with a thick wad of sticky ink on it \u2014 all while offering another pleasant smile. \"So my dear guests, there is very little I do not have in my establishment be it far off drinks or rarely refined spices. However I am unlikely to have the products of various companies, particularly ales and liquors you may be accustomed to; it is hard for a small business as mine to come to terms with such you see. I may with a quick read make rare or exotic meals if such is desired and most certainly have the staples of restuarants like wines, steaks, sandwiches, sorbets, but its donuts and beer to protect and to serve eh?\" It was a quick joke given with a happy wink and smirk, before he continued on. \"Today the specials for the main course are as follows: blue cheese chicken stuffed with a choice of herbs, duck with caramelized apricot, and fermented sea herring... I will note the last one is a very pugnant dish and for the conoisseur I will say - but! an experience to treasure if you can convince those you are with. For garnish I have stock of cactus to grill or sautee and a nice barley-mushroom shred. In from the North some magically freshened squid has been delivered to start an appetite while in my cellar we got an aromatic cinammon cider. To finalize the specials your desert can be a wonderful honey cake or a ground nut pie.\" With that, he awaited their order as he blinked thrice to begin heating up various appliances for cooking.

He didn't want to eat while he was nervous, and certainly not something so exotic as food unknown to him might upset his stomach.
