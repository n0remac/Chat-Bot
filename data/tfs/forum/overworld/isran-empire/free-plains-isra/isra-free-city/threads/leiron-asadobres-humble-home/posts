Within the typical looking Isran residence was a simple though well crafted wooden floor and plaster walls. The main room holding the only extra seating in the entire home also severed as a bedroom. A small albeit function kitchen was adjacent and a small loft above the main room gave Leiron a place to draw maps and work on his magic. As well as an out of sight place to stash keepsakes from their many trips into the wilds of the world. The place was hardly large enough for two people, much less a dragon, so Asadobres is forced to maintain her humanoid guise when at home. Despite all of this Leiron and Asadobres were happy here. They ate meals together, slept in the same bed, and even teamed up to keep the place mostly tidy.\u00a0\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/nSS9BHX.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/nSS9BHX.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/></div>"}, "post-75793": {"user": "Leiron", "user_num": 374, "timestamp": "1511845067000", "message": "Leiron entered their home first and let out an exhausted sigh. He was grateful things didn't go south at the Gathering Field. He set down at the dining table and took a moment to decompress. He had seen some powerful beings at the field and he found himself wondering if his magic and even Asa's could stand up to such creatures. At least they were able to get a feel on the one who summoned the dragons. He had wrote a detailed report and handed it off to a guard at the Citadel's gate before heading home. With luck it would help. ", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Leiron entered their home first and let out an exhausted sigh. He was grateful things didn't go south at the Gathering Field.

Could she become so powerful? Would she? What would she even do with such size and strength. To be so beyond the reach of other normal beings. More importantly could she do so without being around her own kind. She would never leave Leiron's side, regardless. After the drinks were made she came into the main room and offered a mug to Leiron, the two of them were prepared for a nice evening in after their adventure today. Well as nice as she could get with such things on her mind.  ", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Asadobres came in right behind Leiron.
