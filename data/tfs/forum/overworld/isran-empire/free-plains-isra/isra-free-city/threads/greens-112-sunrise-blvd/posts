If one was seeking to be succinct, the description they would give Lum'Valia's smile would be radiant. Such curtness though pays poor tribute to the reality of the holy dragons smile. Her smile is filled with the pure love of a mother watching her new born babe laugh for the first time. Her smile is filled with the simple joy of a child playing with a favorite toy. Her smile conveys a depth of compassion, empathy, and forgiveness that most would believe only a saint should posses. This smile leaves little doubt in the minds of all, but the most jaded or evil of individuals, that there is good in the world and that the being behind this smile is part of it. The dragoness laughs lightly as Kate stammers, it is not a cruel laugh but one of understanding and amusement, and the dragon says in her languid, melodic, angelic voice."}, "post-19572": {"user": "Kate Green", "user_num": 567, "timestamp": "1450912746000", "message": "Kate gasped.

Beyond that, Naoki\u2019s thoughts lead her to think ahead for what seems like the tenth time today. To the future. On how to continue these sorts of things. To eight more months, and hopefully longer. To the pouch on her hip, and the trip ahead of them. Disconcerting sorts of thoughts, those are. However pleasant the best-case-scenario may be to consider, the nagging and ever-present bad possibilities exist, and will continue to exist and grow more probable as time wears on. Rejection. Disharmony. Hell, assassination is a perfectly valid concern to have. She would need to see about stationing more security around the little shop. The most unsettling thought, Naoki muses, in this situation but also generally speaking, is such that while one may speculate, while one may hope and dream and do their very best to shape the future to their will, there are no certainties.
