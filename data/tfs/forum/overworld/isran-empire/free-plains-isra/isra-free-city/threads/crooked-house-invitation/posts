It speak of an odd man with a terrible twisted body. When it is looked into the rhyme produces more interesting aspect. There is said to be a creature stalking the night. It has the face of a bird and the body of a man. It's body moves with an odd twisting grace as though it's spine is crooked. It is said this creature is stalking the streets striking fear into the criminal class. This creature is said to have a home that can only be reached by walking a crooked mile.The truth is stranger than fiction in this case. The crooked man of Isra is The Fisher King. The powerful phobophage has taken to striking fear into criminals to feed himself. He hunts criminals primarily to avoid rigorous pursuit by the local\u00a0constabulary. After all he leaves them alive and stops the crimes what's to investigate. He has created a house with his partner Crow. This house inhabits a pocket dimension within Isra. It can only be reached with the help of Crow & The Fisher King     .(Main Hall.)(Study.)(Dining Room.)(Living Room.)(Bedroom.)(Garden.)This location is heavily warded. The pocket dimension it inhabits is subject to the whims of it's creators.
