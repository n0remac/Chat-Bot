The building was claimed by the banks and sat uninhabited for quite a while before it was quietly purchased by a minor noble. It now stands with iron bars on the windows and has been given a fresh new coat of paint. The oak door and frame are reinforced with iron bands and secured with a masterwork lock. The interior of the tavern space is still quite nice and well kept, with richly colored cherry wood flooring and wall panels. Off to the side stands a large stone hearth, and hanging above it is a large shield painted with a family crest of a wolf howling at an eclipsed moon. Spaced around the room are oak support pillars engraved with scenes from stories of the old world and battles of yore. The main room has been refurbished, the few remaining original tables and chairs have been inter spaced with replacements. While the upper floors are accessible by twin spiral staircases winding around two of the engraved pillars the basement is only accessible by a locked trapdoor behind the bar. The upper floors once housed 18 separate rooms but has since been converted, groups of four rooms connected into four suites and the last two into bathing areas. At the back of the room stands a brightly polished mahogany countertop set above recently restored and beautifully painted panels. Past the counter is a door that leads to what once was the staff room, which has been converted into a maintenance room, and the kitchen. All in all, it still doesn't quite feel like a home.

I am not entirely sure of the origins of my father's mortal form because it was created far before I was born. I have never questioned him on it- perhaps out of fear of knowing the truth.

So I apologize for my bad explanation.Though it has been illuminating.\" Amaya mused, looking away from him to look at the deep red liquid in her cup. His words were cutting- especially the name he'd chosen to call her. It both made her want to tear up and made her furious. But the end result was just exhaustion. It was the same song and dance she'd done so many times before. \"I understand now that you judge someone upon the sins of their family and blood and not upon their actions alone. Even if, my father had done something as horrifying as that- I did not. I did not condone his actions. I was not even alive when the action was done. My father is not me. And I, am not my father. I do not control him and more importantly, he does not control me. We are separate beings though, I realize that is difficult to begin to comprehend.\"Though the conversation made her want nothing more than to down the rest of her drink  and possibly several more, she slid her cup forward and reached into her pack producing her coin wallet, pulling out enough silver to pay for both of their drinks as well as extra coin for the disturbance.
