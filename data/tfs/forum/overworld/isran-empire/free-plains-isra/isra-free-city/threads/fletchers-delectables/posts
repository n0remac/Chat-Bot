Both very strong reasons. Now, let me tell you the tale of why I became a dragonslayer:It was fifty years ago. I was only fifteen then, a mere boy, nothing more than the local sugarsmith's apprentice. This was back in the old days, when dragons would just attack villages and steal the treasure. Sacrificing young women to the beasts was a common practice. I dunno if it worked or not, but we did it anyway because it was traditional and it made sense. In a stupid kind of way. Anyhow, I was sitting in my master's shop, learning how to forge a chocolate claymore. It was magical, watching him work. Ah, how I miss old Master Choc. Crazy as hell, but I miss him. Anyways...back to the story. Where was I? Ah yes, the chocolate claymore. The master was pouring the chocolate when it came. A huge beast, covered in shining red scales. It tore through my village. People were screaming, houses were on fire, swords were being drawn. And all the time, Master Choc was so calm, so collected. He finished the blade as the village burned, only pausing to slap me when I became hysterical. He ground it to a razor's edge within minutes. I couldn't believe it. The finest chocolate blade I'd ever seen, done in record time. And the master...I'll never forget what happened next. He lifted the blade high and he said to me, he said 'Watch me, Renalt. Watch as I prove to the world that chocolate is a viable battle implement.' He was a brave, brave man. Crazy as a bat, but brave. He charged out the door, blade held high. I was scared. I hid inside the shop, peeking out the window. He ran straight towards the beast, and thrust the blade, the wonderful, flawless blade, into the dragon's side! The sword...it shattered. The dragon turned and swallowed Master Choc in an instant, like you would swallow a piece of peppermint. No ceremony. No monologue. Nothing. He didn't die a warrior's death...he barely died any death at all. One moment he was there, the town's savior, the next moment he was gone. The dragon flew away, and I climbed out. I was numb. I could barely stand. I walked up to where it happened, where the wondrous blade lay in pieces. They were melted. The heat from the dragon's flame had melted it. That sword was the finest thing my master had ever made. It was the pinnacle of his life's work. And it had been destroyed, melted to an unrecognizable brown lump, with as little ceremony as how my master had died. I swore, then. I swore to find the creature, and all of its kin, and destroy them. I swore to not give them honorable deaths, but quiet ones, deaths that nobody would write about. I didn't want them dead, I wanted them gone. Forgotten. Extinguished from people's memories. I went to the blacksmith that very day and purchased a sword, with what little money I had. I left at dawn, and never looked back.\"He coughs.\"Anyhow, I killed dragons for about fifteen years as my main source of income until my son Richard was born. I didn't want to risk him growing up without a father, so I hung up my blade and opened up a candy shop. That's what I've been doing for the past thirty years.

Somewhere in the motion, the toothpick disappears, never to be seen again. After a few moments of careful chewing, she nods, though without very much enthusiasm. Without being offered one, Naoki reaches forward to take another sample, and then, with her other hand, a third. With these in hand, Naoki turns her back on Renalt and takes a few steps toward the door. Extending her arms to either side, she offers these samples to the guards at the door. One accepts, and rather than attempting to transfer the toothpick from her delicate fingers to whatever sort of chain metal-nonsense that are his gauntlets, Naoki just drops it into his palm, and after removing the toothpick, he pops it into his mouth without complaint. The other guard opens his mouth in protest, and in a hushed tone, implies that if the samples have been poisoned or laced with a sleeping agent or some such, it would be exceptionally foolish for them all to have one. Further, it\u2019s bad policy for them, the guards, to eat anything while on duty, he insists. The other guard looks over, happily enjoying his square of fudge. He eyes the other, considering his partner something of a stickler.

Sighing inwardly, he plastered a smile on his face as he turned to face the excessively enthusiastic journalist.\"Why hello,\" he said, shaking her hand. \"I suppose you could do it here, it's been a bit of a quiet day lately. Can I interest either of you in a sample of fudge? A mug of hot cocoa, perhaps? It is rather cold outside.\"He considered her question carefully, casting a suspicious eye at that pen of hers. Why did she need to know how long he'd had the shop? What business of hers was that? These damn journalists were so nosy, so untrustworthy. He'd have to be careful with his responses.\"I've had the shop almost as long as the city's been around,\" he said. \"I was one of the first businesses to open, believe it or not.\"Glancing up at Freddy, he wondered exactly what the man could be sketching.

What were they talking about? When had he ever agreed to an interview? He generally tried to avoid journalists, as a rule. They always had a tendency to twist people's words and disturb folks who would rather just enjoy their peace and quiet. What letter could they have possibly be talking about? He always got lots of letters from various people, and generally let them pile up. Perhaps it had been that one night when he'd gotten mind-bogglingly drunk and had decided to finally reply to the huge heap of letters. The letters he wrote started out polite, but had grown more and more irritable as the night progressed. He had informed quite a few people of what he actually thought of them and the professions of their mothers, had sent some people letters consisting of nothing more than long strings of colorful and creative alliterative profanity, and more than a couple envelopes containing nothing more than crudely drawn genitalia of varying sizes. That must have been it. He must have sent a response to their letter that night.

The letter of acceptance had been an odd ramble though, but when she had been invited over to 'Hear the damn truth' she had stopped reading and didn't even care to guess what kind of farm animals or whatever his odd drawing skills tried to resemble. \"Oh yes please, Mr. Fletcher that would be fantastic!\" she said and accepted both the fudge and the hot cocoa with little hesitation and also Freddy gladly agreed to some hot cocoa, though he had to decline the fudge as to not get his fingers sticky as that could ruin his sketches. As Amanda would presumably having been given the fudge and cocoa she tasted the deliciousness stuffing her mouth with the fudge and tasting the hot cocoa afterwards. Both were indeed delicious although she nearly burned her tongue from eagerness after being a bit too quick in tasting it. \"This is really good Mr. Fletcher..!\" Amanda commented and swallowed the last piece of fudge. It seemed like his shop wasn't just popular because of the looks on the candy but also the taste. \"That long huh?\" Amanda said and nodded biting her lower lip as she concentrated on scribbling notes while listening intently. \"But Mr. Fletcher since this store has become so much of a success drawing in customers like the empress and renowned heroes from all over Isra, how come you have yet to branch out and open other stores too?\" Amanda asked the candy store owner perhaps implying that the store could be doing even better although this was fully open to interpretation. \"Who are your best customers then, Mr. Fletcher? And what do they buy from the store?\" Amanda asked and tapped her pen into the notebook thinking before moving onto next question. \" An if you were to pick a piece in here that you are especially proud of, what would it be?\" she inquired as Freddy looked up well aware that he would need to be sketching and drawing what Mr. Fletcher told Amanda now.

Who needed all these fancy news features, anyways?\"I'm glad you like it,\" he said. \"I would say my fudge is my proudest creation in here. It may be simple, but it's my best seller. I make it fresh every day, and it's always sold out by closing. I make a different variety each day. Sometimes I add caramel, other times peppermints, sometimes ginger. The chocolates are nice, and the other candies too, but the fudge really holds a special place in my heart.\"And my coinpurse, he thought. The fudge was his best seller, and he always made a decent profit off each batch.\"I haven't built any other stores because I'm only one man. I trust myself to manage things here, and sometimes my niece or nephew when they're about. Nobody can manage this place like I can, though. The organization, the logbooks, the pricing...everything about it has to be perfect, and I can keep it perfect by running it myself. Anyways, why would I need to expand? I'm perfectly happy with my shop here, and I don't want for anything money-wise.\"As for my best customer, well, that depends on what you mean. My most prestigious, you already know. It's always an honor to provide my products for the Empress, and she even comes down to peruse the shelves herself on occasion. She's got her favorites of course, which you can see over there.\"He gestured to a small pedestal display, with a selection of various chocolates arranged on top. A small sign proclaimed them to be the \"Empress' picks\" with a crude sketch of Naoki herself enjoying a bar of chocolate. \"My most loyal customers...well, I've got regulars who come in every couple of days, but there are several children who I'd have to call the most loyal.

Perhaps a daring question, but there might be an interesting answer laying there. \"How did you come to make candy though? Did you have a master or were you self taught?\" Amanda inquired and wondered. \"And did you apply your trade outside Isra at any point?\" she added thinking perhaps he had a reputation elsewhere. \"Rounding it off may I ask if you have any plans for retirement and having your niece or nephew taking over the candy shop at some point?\" Amanda asked inquisitively - leaving such a well known shop in other hands might be quite a good story.
