She cited reasons relating to the integrity of the half-destroyed structure and existing problems with the foundation, but some suspect other factors were at play. Regardless, The Empress ordered the construction of a new establishment \u2014  a spiritual successor to The Sun \u2014 that would fulfill the same role and give the survivors somewhere to go. Though its popularity weaned toward the later years, The Midnight Sun was and has always been the most popular watering hole in The City, and its destruction left many without anywhere to go. As such, on the north side of The Grand Bazaar, there now stands a rather new-looking building, set apart from its fellows by the quality of its construction and its immaculate aesthetic. As the door opens, disgorging a happy-looking patron, laughter and music sound a fanfare to their departure. The air that escapes smells of spices and mystery, free-flowing liquor and well-used cards, love, lust, seduction, and everything the soul craves. This establishment, standing over The Grand Bazaar like a queen looking out over her kingdom, is The Starlight Dawn. Its doors never close, for the sun never sets on debauchery.If a traveler were to enter, they would find themselves in the main bar area: a large rectangular room that extends some three stories upward to touch the feet of the figures in the ceiling's exquisite mural. Wide balconies with ornately carved wooden banisters and railings line the left and right sides of the second level, looking down on those below. The right-hand balcony is reserved for favored patrons, and contains high-backed booths with plush benches. Runic arrays inside the benches ensure that conversations held within remain confidential. The main floor is littered with round tables and ringed with booths, save for a clear area in front of the stage in the back of the room. On the left wall is the centerpiece of the whole establishment: the bar. Ornate stools belly up to a thick slab of mirror-finished ebony that runs all but the entire length of the room. Behind it, towering shelves hold bottles of every possible shape and size, some of which glow or swirl ominously on their perch. A team of bartenders dressed in immaculate white suits bustle about behind it, attending to the unquenchable thirsts of its patrons. Mixed drinks of an alchemical nature are the traditional specialty of The Starlight Dawn, and while they will happily dispense ale as any common barhand, it is in the mixing of these finer beverages that pays their appropriately \u2018finer\u2019 salary.Out on the main floor, only the most comley of waitresses weave their way through the tables with plates of all descriptions. The traditional staples of meat, potatoes, stew, and so on, but also more exotic dishes smelling of the spice of far-off lands. Shutters on the far wall are constantly in motion as they come and go from the kitchen, passing under the watchful gaze of their guardian: an absolute unit of a gentleman some eight feet tall, dressed just as the bartenders. They call him The K.P. on account of his job description: The Keeper of the Peace.And so it goes in The Starlight Dawn: day in, day out, through the night, every night. There is no \u201clast-call,\u201d and the kitchen never closes, for the sun never sets on debauchery.", "link_list": ["/user/607"], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/CvAlu5j.jpg"], "html": "Following the bombing of The Midnight Sun, "}, "post-93534": {"user": "Empress Naoki", "user_num": 607, "timestamp": "1572241937000", "message": "Shrouded in darkness on the second-floor balcony, The Empress sits alone, out of sight from the patrons below. A Sentinel standing in the door is to see that she\u2019s not disturbed. As she sips her drink, she\u2019s hit by a wave of melancholy that\u2019s been haunting her for a long time. It\u2019s not the same. To anyone who had ever visited The Midnight Sun, The Starlight Dawn is astonishingly similar. Though somewhat larger, the builders were instructed to mimic The Sun as well as they could, and they\u2019ve done admirably in that goal. The same floorplan, the same types of wood, the same paintings on the wall, the same sort of candles, the same detailing on the banisters, and even the very same mural overhead, right down to the dimple on the cherub\u2019s bum.To most, The Starlight Dawn is just a bigger, better Midnight Sun in a more convenient location. Some even go so far to say that it was a good thing The Midnight Sun was destroyed because at least they have some elbow room now (haw haw haw.)But when such sour comments reach The Empress\u2019 pointed ears, they flatten against the top of her head in anger and abject disgust. Prior to her election, back when it was Madame instead of Empress, The Midnight Sun was Naoki\u2019s everything. The seat of her power, the sum of her wealth, her business, her organization, her base of operations, her family, and her home.After becoming Lady of Isra she no longer had time to stay at The Midnight Sun, what with a city to be responsible for and all. So she transferred management of The Sun to a trusted friend \u2014 Calico Shwartz, and began spending more and more time at The Citadel and abroad, administrating her domain, tending to the needs of her people and growing her empire. But as she cast her gaze further and further and as she set her goals higher and higher, as she brought Isra to new heights of power and prosperity, the life she had down in the little tavern gradually faded away, as did everyone in it.A few of her old friends stayed with her, and for that, she is grateful. Alden, Liz, and of course, Grandma \u2014 invaluable allies all; without them, neither she nor the world at large would be in as good of shape as they are today. But the rest are gone, their names forgotten. Left to pursue opportunities elsewhere. Killed by Goraia\u2019s artifact. Vanished into The Mists. Artificial body finally gave out. Assassinated. Dragged back to the Hellscape. Overdose. Several counts of killed in battle \u2026 And most of all, abandoned her in search of a fucking plant.Face contorted in anguish, Naoki is aware that she\u2019s just indulging the feeling at this point, but she doesn\u2019t care. This isn\u2019t the first time she has sat alone on the second-floor balcony and felt bad for herself, but it is the first time she\u2019s had to do it in this hollow mockery of a building. The bombing of The Midnight Sun was the last nail in the coffin; what was once hers is now gone, forever. She can\u2019t go sit in her office and remember the memories she made there; she can\u2019t order her old favorite dish and find comfort in its familiar taste. She can\u2019t look at the stains on the table and scuffs on the floor to remember how they were made, and she can\u2019t hear the familiar groan of the steps as she climbs them, because now it\u2019s all just splinters and rubble. For all the power she has \u2014 political, influential, cosmic, demonic, and otherwise \u2014 for all the gold in her vaults, \u2014 for all the Legionaries at her command and all the ships in her navy, \u2014 for all of her adoring subjects, all those lives that have been saved as a result of her decisions, and for all who have died in her name \u2014 for all of it, here she sits. Here sits The Empress, here sits Naoki. Alone. In the dark. In a replica that which she lost, drinking a replica drink out of a replica glass, lamenting what she used to have and how sorry she is for having lost it. The noise dampening runes in the table ensure that her wailing sobs can\u2019t be heard by the patrons below, but at this moment, she wouldn\u2019t even care if they did. She traded everything she had for the entire world and is only now appreciating the depth of her loss.

Two runs of fabric slip out and down from under the collar, covering her breasts but leaving the middle open, until they are met by another pair that weave in from the sides, and are met in the centre of her abdomen by a beautiful, large, intricately woven sash-like belt, embedded with sapphires at the centre and towards the sides. The weaving material forms under the sash and cascades down her front sides, flicking elegantly with each step, and leaving her long, gorgeous legs, from elegant shoes to her thighs, bare as they step forward, then disappear back into the waves of blue fabric. Her jewelry is set to match her blue ensemble, as she sports a pair of sapphire earrings and matching pendant, sitting on a white chain along her neck, obscured slightly by her wavy, dark brown hair. And finally, the finishing touch, the silver dove that sits on her hip, the signature of those in her line of work and general stature. She's looking for business. The clientele seems to be the usual tonight, and she begins mentally setting them apart into her little tier groups, deciding who goes where, and what order she would approach them in, with tier A being the richest, best looking, and generally up themselves, to tier D, who she would only approach as a last resort, and even then\u2026 she'd rather go home empty handed.

This change had been, in no small part, thanks to The Midnight Sun and the people he'd met within it. Of whom it seemed only Naoki was truly left. Now The Midnight Sun was gone and all that was left now was this imitation that seemed to be mocking him for his failure.Of course, no one viewed it as his failure. Things happened, it wasn't his job to police the city he was to handle extraordinary tasks. Even if it was his job, the attack had been utterly random and without apparent motive. How could anyone have predicted it? How could anyone have stopped it? Alden didn't know but that didn't stop him from feeling like it was somehow his fault. That didn't stop him from being incredibly frustrated that the culprit had never been caught which left him feeling impotent, a rare thing for him to ever feel. He didn't like it but there was very little he could do about it.Alden had spent enough time ruminating. He'd been given a task by the empress and it was time to do it. Slipping down from his hiding place in the rafters he lands silently on the floor, using one of the supporting pillars to block people's line of sight to him. Even in a large busy building, it was easy to move unnoticed, in fact, it was even easier to move unnoticed. There was always something better to look at, something begging the attention of those present. Even when a person is scaling down from the ceiling, if you knew how to move smoothly enough you could avoid notice.Moving away from the sides of the building he winds his way through the crowded room like a summer's breeze. Barely noticed and gone before anyone can truly register his presence. It doesn't take him long to come to the bar and siddle up next to the woman in the blue dress. He was dressed casually, a white silk tunic, black riding pants, his long boots, and he'd found a wide-brimmed hat with a ridiculous bit of plume to hide his features from the room at large.\"Excuse me miss, I was wondering if I could get a moment of your time in private?\"The low rich tenor of the man that had just approached her would surely catch Fiona's attention. As would, doubtlessly, the charming white smile, which if she was observant she might see doesn't reach his eyes, of course, her attention might be more attracted to the full bag of coins he was discreetly flashing at her in his other hand. Surprisingly, this wasn't the first time he'd done such a thing. In his old life as an assassin, he'd had to put on such acts before, though his actions had been routine, performed like clockwork without any understanding of the implication.

He set the coin down on the counter and motioned for another drink, a particularly stout looking concoction that he threw back with little effort.<br><br/>The mood changed when he was asked about his mask. He shifted in his seat and tapped his fingers against his chin, willing his brain to think of something to say. He might get in trouble if he spoke too specifically about his family, so he chose to stay vague. His hand gripped the bottom of the mask and he lifted it to show just a portion of the scar tissue before moving it back into place.<br/><br/>\u201cMy face got all - all fucked up when I was a kid. \u2018s real scary, so I hide it so th\u2019 people don\u2019t uh, run away in fear.\u201d On the last part, he made a wiggling motion with his fingers, smiling though his tone suggested a level of sadness.<br/><br/>\u201c\u2018s fine, though. Jus\u2019 a scar. What are you celebratin\u2019? Seems like a lonely celebration if you came here all alone like. I mean, I imagine th' men come easily to you. I usually have to uh, look pretty hard for mine.\" The joke wasn't funny in the slightest but he guffawed anyways. A few hours later, when he woke up with a splitting headache, he'd find this the most regrettable moment thus far. The night and conversation were young, though. He ordered another drink and motioned to Fiona.<br/><br/>\"Wan' one or do you wanna uh, stay with the wine? I don' blame you, this shit is fuckin' awful. I don' know why I chose to drink tonight. Oh, I'm uh, not tryin' to flirt either. Promise.\"<br/></br></font>"}, "post-94729": {"user": "Loralyn", "user_num": 3291, "timestamp": "1579565322000", "message": "Loralyn gave a semi-panicked nod as she kept the deep hood as low as she possibly could over her face.
