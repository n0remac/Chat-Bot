Covered promenades rim the central plaza, the gilding on their roofs and the white marble of their columns glinting in the sunlight. \u00a0In the center of the plaza, a marble statue of five figures stands on a pedestal in the middle of a pool. A short human man, clad in a farmer\u2019s roughspun clothing and armed with a club, joins forces with a tall female elven archer in armor, arrow nocked against invisible foes, to stand guard over a human family - man, woman, and infant child, the man dressed in nobleman\u2019s robes and the woman in a peasant\u2019s simple gown. Even as the family stands behind their protectors, the set of their jaws and their stance shows that they are not afraid, and the wife prepares a spell. Water pours from the sword, spell, and arrow into the pool below.\u00a0Small trees and bushes sit in beds ringed with flowers around the plaza, with benches strategically positioned by the beds. At night, soft white lighting pours from these beds, creating islands of illumination in a sea of enchanted semidarkness. Around the plaza, kiosks and bulletin boards hold advertisements and notices, from minutes of the last Assembly meeting, to flyers from stores and merchants, to farmers looking to rent a team of oxen. In one area, several food vendors ply their wares to the hungry populace.\u00a0All in all, the plaza is a popular place to meet new faces, find work, or simply relax. Its central location and various attractions ensure that it is rarely empty, even at night.\u00a0", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/620/fletchers-delectables", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1796/isra-branch", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1168/moonlight-eclipse", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1310/midnight-sun", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/481/violet-witch"], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/8NouaKb.jpg", "http://i.imgur.com/eDt9Ahr.png", "http://i.imgur.com/Qn5FL5Z.png", "http://i.imgur.com/KTxUQIw.png", "http://i.imgur.com/6swKqA3.png", "http://i.imgur.com/hoNMzpk.png"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"http://i.imgur.com/8NouaKb.jpg\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/8NouaKb.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/></div>"}, "post-35655": {"user": "Emahra Untyrid", "user_num": 1453, "timestamp": "1462042478000", "message": "The sun had begun to sink toward the far horizon, painting the elegant, peaceful plaza in shades of purple, pink, and orange.

He flagged down the nearest guard, waving the waiver from Naoki fast enough that he would see the Lady's signature at the bottom, ordering, \"The Lady has ordered that I temporarily take control of the city guard until she has finished reco-ordinating her government. Make haste and run to the the headquarters of the nearest mage organisation and get every hydro-mage they have out here, immediately.

As they entered the main plaza, Ryden stood at the very limits of the conflagration, the guards that accompanied him spreading out in a crescent shape to either side of him. Each of them had left enough space between himself and the next to provide room for drawing a sword, and accordingly, they were all holding their hilts, ready to brandish the blades at the mass of pyromancers. \"Gentlemen! In the name of the Lady of Isra, and the law she imposes, I demand that you stop this incessantly needless revelry. Your actions are causing danger to the members of the public, and if you do not cease your actions, we will be necessitated to use force to end this party. You have once chance to end this, or we will be forced to subjugate you!\"For all Ryden's smooth speaking in official chambers, when he was out on the street, he had a booming voice that could be heard all around, and clearly to the mages in the centre of the plaza. He alone stood with sword drawn in one hand, and he was readying a ward in the other, in case it became necessary to prevent himself from being burned.

If any of you- or anyone else, have a problem with anything that I just said, or with Sir Greyiron or his orders, a question about the changes, a complaint to lodge, or any other conundrum related to the matter at hand, you are to come see me, in my office. Likewise, do not prevent or discourage any of your fellows from coming to see me. Such behavior would be a capital offense! Any questions?\u201dThe hardness of her tone leaves no room for questions. Some of the men shift uneasily on their feet, others maintain eye contact with Naoki for the duration of her speech. One guard even salutes, but no questions are raised. Her own eyes make careful note of these reactions, storing away the information for later. \u201cGood. Thank you, gentlemen.\u201dShe nods sharply once in the direction of the group of the assembled guard, before turning abruptly about to face Ryden. The sharp features of her face soften, and her debatably harsh tone of voice is gone, to be replaced with a pleasant whisper. \u201cDon\u2019t try to placate me, Greyiron. If I were not already the master of myself and my emotions, I wouldn\u2019t be in the position I am today. Look at the way the guards are acting. You see that older man on the far right; the short one with the goatee and the captain's stripe? He\u2019s one of the more senior captains- I\u2019ve seen him around. You see the way he looks at the younger captain standing to his immediate right? You see that contempt in his eyes? I would be willing to bet- and indeed, I do! I bet you five gold coins that the younger captain was not here when the events transpired, and the older one was, doing his best to stop things. He resents the younger one for leaving, and is himself loyal. My face is as much a tool as your sword, Greyiron, and I wield it as such. Use your methods to rectify this situation, but realize that my own are often quite effective- especially so when dealing with interpersonal problems such as these. If any of them give you trouble, send them my way, and come up yourself when you\u2019re done.\u201dWith that said, Madame Naoki nods once in farewell to Ryden, beckons for Second Lieutenant Calgary to follow her,\u00a0and begins to walk back toward the steps leading back up into the Citadel, Artemis always at her side.

On this morning- which shows signs of rain, but has yet to deliver, Naoki is wearing, as she tends to, a loose white blouse and some fine, but otherwise unobtrusive black trousers. Her pouch of gemstones hangs from one hip, and Artemis follows just slightly behind. Naoki strides purposefully, but not necessarily enthusiastically. Today would be the first day of implementing her new policies. But such things exist in parallel with her other responsibilities, and will be indirectly eating into what would otherwise be her free time. Still. It has to be done. Having made her way properly into the plaza, Naoki spends a moment to survey her surroundings. Things seem to be proceeding just about as they tend to, in the Central Plaza in the morning. Commuting workers shuffle along the promenades, headed for their respective workplaces. The merchants have already finished setting up their stalls for the day, and are now proceeding to push their goods on any passerby who dare to make eye contact. Advertisements are nailed not only to the notice boards intended for such things, but also to benches, walls, pillars, and anything else at eye level. The majority of the advertisements are new, since the last time Naoki looked. A pair of guards have broken away from their post, and are attempting to remedy the issue, removing advertisements outside of the designated areas, but they don\u2019t seem to have made much progress. The lapping of water in the fountain is entirely drowned out by the drifting conversations of the plaza\u2019s occupants. Angling her ears just so, Naoki is able to pick out a few snippets of conversation, and she stand motionless, listening for a few moments. There doesn\u2019t seem to be anything of any particular note to be heard, though. Simply people, going about their business. And here, a small pang of pride hits Naoki. Here are people. Her people. Going about their business; in her city. Happily, for the most part. One young man waves nervously, and Naoki returns a wink, running her tongue across her upper lip before returning to surveying the crowd at large. It\u2019s been a fair few months since she\u2019s been elected; and the city hasn\u2019t burnt down yet. Naoki isn\u2019t one for superstition, but Isra\u2019s continued existence under her leadership must be some manner of miracle. Even so, it\u2019s a rather fulfilling feeling. Seeing all the little people puttering about and earning money to be taxed. But standing about, people-watching isn\u2019t quite what Naoki came here to do. Meandering over to one side of the plaza, Naoki selects a bench. Made of carved marble, one of many, and not even so much as distinguishable from the one next to it, save for the fact that this one sits in the sun, and is therefore significantly warmer to sit on. Having selected the bench, Naoki seats herself upon it with all due care, smoothing out her blouse once seated. Now seated upon the bench, she proceeds to sit. Apparently waiting for someone, or something. She drapes one arm across the back of the bench, and adjusts her posture just so as to seem approachable.

Standing there in the doorway, out of the line of sight of all but the rearmost of the crowd, is, as one might expect, Lady Naoki.

As she proceeds down the stairs, it clinks and clanks, as plated armor tends to, though it seems awfully loud to her.After a longer walk down the stairs than Naoki really would have preferred to keep up her dramatic timing, she arrives at the stage/platform and steps up onto it. It creaks a bit under her weight, and she reflects in passing that it certainly would be a spectacle for her to go tumbling down the remainder of the stairs in a mess of shattered wood, metal armor, and tail, but doesn\u2019t stop. Instead, she steps directly up onto the podium and proceeds to clear her throat.\u201cHe-hem.\u201dThe sound reverberates throughout the square and the city, evidently amplified by some trick of magic. However, it\u2019s a bit on the loud side, causing even Naoki to wince a bit at the sound of her own voice.After a moment, she tries again, \u201cHe-hem.\u201dThis time, the volume is somewhat more reasonable, only loud enough to be clearly heard, but not quite loud enough to screech. Nodding to herself- evidently satisfied, Naoki proceeds with her address, \u201cPeople of Isra. For long, we have heard of the atrocities committed by Goraia. We have heard of their bloody coup, the murder of Hylon Emarae, and the events that followed. It was a year ago, now, that their reign of tyranny and oppression began. Since then, they have imprisoned, enslaved, and brutally mistreated Medanese citizens day after day. Now we know that these evils have not stopped within their own borders. They are raping, murdering, and torching lands that never belonged to them!\u201dWith each clause, the tempo and passion of Naoki\u2019s voice increases, building toward a crescendo. Additionally, she begins to gesticulate wildly with one hand, waving it about emphatically in time with her words.\u201cThere are those who stand among us even now who, while fortunate enough to have successfully escaped, have witnessed Goraian cruelty firsthand! There are those who stand among us at this moment who have lost their mothers, brothers, fathers, and children to the malicious and uncaring Goraian steel or prison camps. There are they who know the relentless grip of tyranny first hand.\u201dHere, she pauses for the space of a moment, her gesticulating hand frozen in place, one finger pointed straight up.\u201cBut I say this. No longer!\u201d With this, she slams the gesticulating hand down upon the surface of the podium. This causes the whole rickety affair to jump slightly under her feet with the force of the blow, threatening to collapse and send her careening down the steps. She makes a mental note to avoid doing that again.Repeating herself more clearly, she continues, \u201cNo longer. Isra will not allow such atrocities to be committed- both to a nation that was once our ally- nor to anyone who is a part of the free world. Isra was founded under the auspicious principles of freedom, democracy, and the rights of all to enjoy life peacefully. Under those ideals, we have grown strong. And while it may be unreasonable to expect the whole world to adopt such ideals as their own, it is unacceptable for any group- regardless of its status, affiliation, or supposed justification, to do what Goraia has done and not expect retribution. We cry out for the voiceless, for the meek and lowly who cannot speak out for themselves. We care for the enslaved, for the widow and orphan, when no one else will. We fight for the weak.\u201dHere, she pauses for the space of a moment, allowing her words to resonate and reverberate before continuing,\u00a0\u201cAnd so, where the people of Medan cannot stand up against the oppressors, I tell you today that Isra will. I, High Lady Naoki, on behalf of the sovereign state of Isra, do hereby declare war on Goraia. Their mistreatment of their own citizenry has persisted for far too long. We turn to war as the final means of liberation for these oppressed, and the utter removal of a power so cancerous to the world stage. The rulers of Goraia have shown they will not live in the light, and so they must be relegated to the darkness that they love so much. If we tolerate such a power for even one more day, then we are directly complicit with their heinous acts. We who love so dearly our own freedoms must share them with the world. If we clutch at them as pearls, holding them above and beyond the rest of the world, then how can we say Isra is a force for good?\u201d", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "On silent hinges, the great doors to The Citadel open outward.

We are called to defend the integrity of justice and freedom in the just and free nations of this world.\" \"It is a principle which permits a state, in the selfish and senseless pursuit of power, to disregard its obligation to the integral and intrinsic rights of each and every living being that inhabits this world; a principle which sanctions the use of force or threat of force against the sovereignty and independence of other states, as it did against Medan, our regrettably lost friends.\"Ryden, at this point emphasising every clause with a stab of his outstretched hand, let it fall to his side, as he paused to let the gravity of his words sink in. \"Such a principle, stripped of all facade, is surely the mere primitive doctrine that might\u00a0is\u00a0right, and if this principle were established through the world, the freedom of our own country and of all others would be forfeit.\"\"But far more than this, the peoples of the world would be kept in the bondage of fear, and all hopes of settled peace and of the security of justice and liberty among and within nations would be ended.\"\"This is the ultimate issue which confronts us.

And what an adventure it had been, seeing so many places, meeting so many new people, watching herself and her people become stronger and stronger. In many ways Lady Naoki's speech seemed to be the culmination of thousands of events.She started to walk along the edge of the roof to get a better view of Lady Naoki's entourage.She remembered the first time she met Jill. Jun herself was little more than a decent mage with a fetish for power and the wanderlust of youth. Jill was a charming (and possibly psychotic) melee fighter who gave no indication of becoming a traitor, She was also her first teacher... Jun remembered Jarkoopi in that dark cave, her very first dragon encounter. Camilla was her very first employer and friend. She remembered the first time she had been to Isra, meeting the eccentric and lovable Demonlord Maelik, discovering the Black Tower, and being hit on by Madame Naoki back when she was still a sultry madame in a red dress.How did it ever come to this? What happened to the hiking, the crazy hi-jinks, the consensual near-death experiences? How did she reach the point of standing on a lonely rooftop watching her friend commit thousands of lives to their doom? The fact of the matter was, despite her anger towards Lord Zephidel and Goraia, she was psychologically wholly unprepared for war. War. The very word made no sense to her. Her grandmother had fought a war, yes. And she had read about plenty of wars. But for the first time in her life she was about to experience one first hand.Jun's hair flipped and flickered into the sad air. There may as well have been a great chasm in between herself and the cheers and Lady Naoki's booming voice below her. The shaking podium and stand from Naoki's overzealous frame did illicit a little chuckle from her. Jun glared at the pointy eared monster, the single deadliest being in all of the world, with her seductive swishing tail. She thought idly what would happen if she summoned a flaming ball of plasma and just tossed it straight into the podium. What would happen if she just ended the whole story then and there? No doubt Naoki's sudden conflagration would bring a dozen or so Sun Marshalls on her position and bring an end to her lengthy tale as well. All her adventures would disappear in that single act. But then so would a war.No, it wasn't worth it. It would accomplish nothing. The people were already galvanized. Jun would be ousted as a traitor and her entire nation would be put to shame. Luckily it was just an idle thought, no different than a peasant wondering what would happen if he stuck his private member in a garter snake's mouth. An amusing simulation to play in one's mind, but not one any reasonable person would act on.Jun sighed. She loved Lady Naoki like a sister. And she also loved Camilla. And deep down inside she knew this was the right thing to do. She would have to steel herself. No doubt the Elder's Council would remain as neutral as possible, committing troops to border defense and perhaps providing food and medical supplies. But after being a part of the militaristic Phoenix State, the Land-Tillers were done with being compelled to commit troops to other nations. The crisis in Aaedan was one thing. There was no moral quandary to be had there. Undead were killing people and the whole world was threatened. Goraia, despite the rumors, had taken no offensive action against her people, or really against anyone (other than themselves). But Jun was a Sun Marshall, an affiliate of the Black Tower, and Camilla's former Lady in Waiting. She did not have the luxury to be neutral. She had to take a stand, one way or the other.\"Sorry Jill, Sorry Jarkoopi...\" She sighed.After the speech was over, Jun raised her hand. A crow flew onto her shoulder.

She was not wearing her armor, or her sword for that matter. Instead, she opted for a more casual attire which she normally wore now whenever armor and a weapon was not needed. She wore black form fitting pants that accentuated her well-toned form quite well, as well as a white low cut shirt. Over this, she wore a furry white coat to keep the cold at bay, it also blended quite well with her long silvery white hair which she let flow down her shoulders and back freely.\u00a0Arya had returned to the city of Isra only recently. The last time she had been to the city had felt like so long ago, when she visited with Lum'valia that one time and met Maelik and then almost fought him to the death outside of the city until Jun and Lum'valia stopped them. Looking back on it, those memories made her smile lightly, she had grown much since then and had managed to even befriend the demon Maelik\u00a0despite their rocky start. She often wondered what happened with him and Lum'valia from time to time during her travels.\u00a0Speaking of memories, someone from times past walked out of the Citadel just then, the High Lady of Isra Naoki. The paladin had heard of the treasurer's rise to power during her travels away from Isra after she had left the Chalet, but standing there among a crowd of thousands of people as she addressed them was still somewhat amazing to witness, at least Arya thought so. Letting a smirk grace her face upon seeing Naoki walk up to the podium. When she began to deliver her speech to the gathered crowd however, this smirk quickly faded from a neutral expression to a somewhat worried one.\u00a0As soon as the topic of Goraia\u00a0came up, Arya had a hunch what this announcement was about, and when it was finally made official a feeling of dread overcame Arya. She did not know much about Goraia\u00a0or Medan for that matter, and she could have taken what Naoki said at face value and assumed there were all monsters. However, Arya knew this was most likely not true. Most likely Isra would be fighting the very people they are fighting to protect, conscripted into Goraia's\u00a0armies and forced to fight for and die for a cause they do not believe in. Family would die on both sides, sons would die, fathers would die, family would die on both sides. Arya would looked around worriedly and she would see, among the cheering masses the mothers of sons who would be sent to war, they were not cheering. She would see those in the military right now, some even younger than herself, they were not cheering. Yet even they would seem to have it better than the common man who fought for Goraia, villainized in the eyes of the Isran\u00a0people even though they were simply following orders, for if they didn't follow orders they would surely face consequences. In the end,\u00a0Arya saw this declaration of war to be very sad, she was sad to see diplomacy fail. Now thousands were inevitably going to die, fighting for what? For the liberation of Goraia? The people of Goraia\u00a0themselves would pay dearly for this liberation, the thought of it made Arya sick. \u00a0This sickness led to anger, and she clenched her fists just a bit in contained anger as she listened to the next speech. Truly she didn't listen to this speech very closely, it sounded much like she expected it would. They had to get the people of Isra on board with this war after all. Arya felt helpless in that moment, just one person of many thousands standing in the streets below looking up upon those who made the decisions that affected all.But then she thought again, what could she really do in this situation? Any single person can make a change, accomplish anything if they put their mind to it, the bar owner, turned treasurer turned ruler of Isra proved that to Arya. Arya could be the change she wanted in the world after all. With a new found determination in the face of war, Arya would leave, walking briskly into the cold air through the relatively empty streets of Isra, her destination already set.\u00a0\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Arya would arrive in the Central Plaza for the announcement.

None stand at her side. Today is not the day that begins any fanfare, nor the use of heralds, so Lady Naoki just proceeds down the stairs briskly, yet with the appropriate amount of grace. On this occasion, she wears a red, double-breasted jacket bearing the Sun Insignia with tall black boots. While not the outfit she wore to command any battle, it seems like one that could use for such a thing, which is the intention. Upon reaching the platform where the podium sits, Naoki turns to one side to clear her throat and tuck a portion of her hair behind one ear before stepping up onto the rostrum, and into the effective range of the phonic-amplification runes places therein.\u201cPeople of Isra,\u201d Naoki begins, her voice ringing out loud and clear over the plaza, as well as a good portion of the city. \u201cAllow me to inform you without any further preamble that the Goraian regime has been torn asunder. Annihilated.\u201d  Naoki punctuates this statement firmly, planting her fist on the surface of the podium.Regardless of if she had planned to or not, Naoki is forced to pause her speech here. The conflict against the tyrannical Goraian regime has been framed as a necessary and righteous battle, and as such, the people of Isra are quite pleased to hear that it has been won, and have erupted in cheers. However, sprinkled among them are some murmurs of disbelief. The armies only left last week. Accounting for travel, that hardly leaves any time for fighting, much less a decisive victory. Some are suspicious, untrusting. Others, stunned, amazed by the feat.Lady Naoki adopts a carefully practiced expression that manages to convey slightly smug patriotism and waits for a few moments before beginning to speak again. \u201cThe battle was short and thankfully not nearly as costly as it could have been. As our forces were traveling to Medan, Goraian command figures deserted their posts to flee, leaving a headless army which promptly surrendered. At this moment, The First Legion is occupying New Brimiarde, and The Second Legion, Stonevale. The Gorarian army in both locations has been disarmed, and very little blood has been shed. While some of their leaders may still be at large, Medan is free.\u201dAnother round of cheers, though not quite as loud as the first. While none can deny that the victory is cause for celebration, the idea that those responsible have eluded justice is a discomforting thought. \"However, our work in Medan is not yet complete. Though we have disbanded the majority of its army, we must be thorough, eliminate all remaining Goraian forces, and take all assets of theirs to ensure that they do not return. Further, we must establish a new government in Medan, and protect the people of Medan during this time of transition. As such, the Legion will remain deployed for some time yet to keep the peace, as Medan is still very much in a state of martial law. News regarding this matter will follow in the coming months in the form of announcements delivered here in the plaza. Consider the state closed to tourism until otherwise indicated. Thank you.\"With this, Lady Naoki raises one hand, displaying her palm to the crowd and waving a bit, before turning about and heading back up the stairs, and into The Citadel.

For this appearance- public as it is, she had chosen to wear a little black dress whose modesty is preserved only by a sort of red cape worn about her waist. As The Empress steps up into view of the crowd it becomes quiet, conversations paused. She pauses to look over the crowd. Hm. Not as many as she had hoped for, Naoki thinks. No one she recognizes as significant, most of these are mere bounty hunters. But it will have to do for today. Raising her voice to an appropriate and regal level, she begins to speak. \u201cCitizens. Travelers. Today I present a Quest, which is as follows. It is a task of retrieval. There is an object, multiple objects, out in the world that I wish to possess. Whosoever brings it to me will be rewarded justly.\u201d\u201cThe object appears as a boulder. A strangely colored boulder that has fallen from the sky- a meteorite. It is likely in multiple pieces, many rocks, and any portion of it is valid for the purpose of this quest. As I will pay five times the weight of any given piece in gold.\u201dHere, Lady Naoki pauses as murmurs spread through the crowd. Five boulder\u2019s worth of gold is an awful lot. An incredible fortune, even a tenth of that would set someone for life.\u201cAdditionally,\u201d Naoki continues, \u201cTo those who may bring particularly large or interesting portions, I will reward. \u2026 Favors.\u201dAnother ripple of murmurs, louder. Dirty jokes are cracked by those who think she can\u2019t hear them. Atop the pedestal, Naoki scoffs once and smirks, amused. She then continues, raising one finger, \u201cBut! I don\u2019t intend to send anyone searching the far corners of the earth; I know where it is.\u201d With a smug smile, She produces a small, circular bit of metal from some pocket and holds it up to the crowd. \u201cBy means of this compass, I know that the prize is within the Eastern Forest.\u201d She pauses. \u201cThe deep portion of the Forest.\u201dA few groans, a few curses by men who realize themselves to have no chance. The depths of the Eastern Forest are known to be more than simply dangerous. Tales of beasts in the forest are told to children, stories of walking trees and spiders the size of horses. Some of it is doubtless an exaggeration, but some truth is behind all tales of that sort, and this is proven to an extent by the fact that many have never come back from forays into the dark woods. Few try.\u201cNeedless to say, groups of soldiers have no place in the deep wood, hence my Quest. To any who intend to attempt the venture, I will provide with a compass like this, such that it may guide them to the prize. I now ask that all who intend to take this quest form an orderly, single file line, such so that they may receive one.\u201dWith a regal gesture, Naoki indicates the ground just before her on the pedestal- where she would like the line to start. As the crowd begins to move, she raises her voice slightly to add, \u201cThis quest will be ongoing until such a point as I close it, and additional compasses may be obtained here until that point.\u201dAfter this line has been formed- perhaps twenty-five long, The Empress concludes her address. \u201cThat is all.

The beginning of a tradition!\u201d \u201cAs pre-cataclysm history goes, something called the Yuletide was once celebrated across the world; it was a time of peace and merry-making. Sources differ on the themes behind the holiday, but common are these: charity, feasting, fertility, and the celebration of successes and good harvests.\u201d\u201cIn the time since Isra\u2019s founding, we have found much success. While other nations falter and collapse under the pressures of poor leadership and lack of direction, we have stood strong! From nothing, we have built an entire Empire, where no one goes hungry, and all are free from the shackles of oppression!  We have grown, we have prospered, and today, we stand proudly as the greatest power in the land!\u201d\u201cSo, as these winter months set in, I say, why not? Why not celebrate, as they once did long ago? Let us now take some days to rest on our laurels! To give unto those less fortunate and those dear to us! Let us feast; let us drink! Let us love, and ensure many strong generations to follow!\u201d\u201cAnd finally, let us celebrate. Let us celebrate what we have accomplished and what is yet to come -- those closest to our hearts and our most far-flung countrymen! To Isra!

Damn, no gold or magical items of extreme power which could assist him in his plan of world domination.A butt? He tried to look at his own rump. Is it that bad? He\u2019d have to look in a portal later.While he appreciated more magical studying material, he was starting to regret taking after book reading, rather than sleeping away the days, it was quite boring at times. Although he knew what he could give to Jun that was relatively equivalent to her gift.He could give her The Empyrean Enchiridion of Sudri, which is a modest book bound in leather with copper hinges and fittings. It was given to Jarkoopi by his father, after he stole it from Saamsadea, one dragon he beat during the Darastrixian wars. It probably wasn\u2019t safe to give to Jun, especially if Saamsadea was still alive, or if her children matured. But, it contained great knowledge and documentation of the ancient civilization of Sudri that lived alongside dragons, pre-darastrixian wars. Unknowingly, it\u2019d now become Jun\u2019s problem should Saamsadea appear to reclaim it, and Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui had already read through it multiple times, he no longer needed it.Should Jun spend a full length reading it, there would be further explanation on dragons, their magic, but most of the book was documentation of the ancient religious civilization and its instances, good and bad, with dragons of the realm. The book might have had a bit of historical inaccuracy, as the dragons in this were portrayed as gods and goddesses, demons and angels, and demi-gods of sorts. Or perhaps they actually were Gods and the like back then, and perhaps Jarkoopi is a demi-god? Who knows? However, the dates on this book were nothing that anyone (Jarkoopi included) had ever seen, so it was impossible to tell how old the book was. It reeked of the old paper smell, and it was clear the pages had gone through some wear and tear, and yet, were still mostly intact.The dragon summoned a small portal, lifting up the book Jun had given him and placing it through the portal. He then felt around through the rift, until his hand came back through holding the Holy book.I think you\u2019ll like this, should you want to read up on dragons that lived probably even before my grandfather\u2019s time.Another portal would appear next to Jarkoopi, with the other end opening behind Jun.

A bolt of lightning struck close by, and in the middle of the melted snow crater she had made, was a book, which she picked up gently and trotted in front of Lum'Valia. \"Here Master Lummie.\"It was a cookbook. \"I collected a bunch of recipes from all the different clans for you to try. I know you're the best cook when it comes to warm and heavier dishes. These are, well they're a little different, but I think you'll like them. But I mean, you're a dragon. You can digest anything, so...\"The recipes included: Hot and sour shrimp soup, green papaya salad, curry chicken, fruit pancakes, a cold seafood dish in which the seafood is \"cooked\" with citrus juices, and an odd drink sort of drinkable fruit salad, among a dozen other things.As for young Keph , when he opened the box, he'd find that the box was itself the present. Inside the box was a jewel-like butterfly, mounted on a little golden stick which slid along a groove, shaped\u00a0like a figure 8. The effect was that the butterfly skated along the surface of the box.But more importantly, the box played music. Taped to the inside was a little note:Dear Keph,No one should spend more than a fraction of a lifetime wandering the world without having heard a musical instrument before.

At this point if the empress wasn't distracted by Qelci she would surely have grabbed his vest which was the closest piece of Ershadt to her. But as she did, Ershadt's free hand would dive into a pocket on his back and grab a gnome-hand sized sack that seemed to be filled to the absolute bursting limit. Ershadt would then with all his strength pound the sack into the ground - and if he couldn't reach the ground he'd use his knee instead. The contents of the sack was his own idea. He had managed to tightly squeeze - a lot - of dust into a small sack, and when popped the contents would explode out into the air for many feet around them. This would naturally cause somewhat of a distraction and also serve as a kind of smoke screen. His hope was that the empress in her surprise would let go of him as well as teaching the nearby Qelci a lesson about keeping her thieving fingers from other thieves treasure. The effect would surely also extend to the sentinels and make it difficult to see.

He hurriedly flew towards the Empress and her party of guards that were seemingly entwined with another party, which he could not fully distinguish through all the sandy bits. To solve that problem, he hovered above the moshpit using the gusts from his wings to disperse the material that was present in the air. He stayed high enough so that he was definitely out of melee range, and the guards would not think him as a threat to the Empress at this time, he wouldn\u2019t want to be mistaken as part of the enemy\u2019s company, while he gathered a bit of magical energy to assist in stopping this madness.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d He deeply grumbled through all the commotion below him while the smokescreen presumably disappeared so he could see exactly what was going on himself.", "link_list": ["/post/77449/thread", "/user/2717", "/user/102"], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/oJMz2IV.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@lumpy\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/77449/thread\" timestamp=\"1515275996\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-2717\" title=\"Lumpy\"><img alt=\"Lumpy Avatar\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/oJMz2IV.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/77449/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1515275996000\" title=\"Jan 6, 2018 13:59:56 GMT -8\">Jan 6, 2018 13:59:56 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-2717 group-0\" href=\"/user/2717\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@lumpy\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Lumpy</span></a></span> said:</div>Being a few paces wide of the actual happenings in front of him, Lumpy was out of range of the guards\u2019 weapons as the came down to protect the empress.

To show off to other how \"well-trained\" he had her? Maybe the officials wanted to see how she was progressing? Or maybe as his... date?Quickly Kaelie shook her head dismissing the notion, and fortunately for Harvey she had plaited it into an elegant braid with bits of holly decorating it so he didn't get smacked with her pigtails.There was no way. Her mind had been filled with all kinds of treasonous thoughts since the accident. She still couldn't understand why she did it. Why she saved those humans. Why she saved him. She'd been avoiding him for that purpose for the past month, pretending to be sleeping whenever he visited. She needed time to think. But even after a month she was no closer to finding the answer. \"Oh! There's the Chief. How about you go over and say hello while I go get us some drinks.\" The older retired fireman said suddenly pulling her out of her daze. She blinked twice and looked up about to offer to switch but the man was already off. Damn, for an older guy he could apparently move when he wanted to. She grimaced slightly before she slowly turned to look in the direction Harvey indicated before booking it and she felt her cheeks burn slightly as he heart stuttered when her eyes landed on Montag for the first time in a month. He looked... well. In his element and comfortable with himself. He didn't seem to have any remnants of injuries which made her breathing a bit easier but not by much. She hesitated a moment before she slowly walked up behind him, her hands folded in front of her. She worried a bit about the fit of the crimson dress she wore, hoping the bandages that still wrapped around her torso weren't too obvious. The white cape that Raelyn had snuck into the box fit snugly around her shoulders and fended off the slight chill. The choker as always sat encircling the column of her neck jingling slightly, matching with the clicking of the white flats she wore. She hesitated the closer she drew to Montag, suddenly having second thoughts. Maybe he had only invited her to be nice? Maybe he wouldn't be glad to see her there thinking it just meant that he had to babysit her.

He was silent for a long moment as a flood of memories of untold and unadmitted anxieties of the past month came to the fore of his mind. There were the sleepless or very little sleep filled nights and the untold of numbers of pots upon pots of coffees haze that he had experienced the first week that she was under, not being allayed whenever he came to check on her condition and still seeing her asleep everytime. Guilt at allowing himself to be stupid enough to put them in a position where they could get hurt, guilt at allowing her to push him out of the way, guilt at his own weakness to protect her. And that brought him to the next few weeks of wondering. Sure he would feel guilty for putting any of his men in such a position, but this seemed... deeper, more raw and painful than any other guilt he had experienced. Why would this feel different for her? Maybe because he was her guardian? Maybe, but that seemed too easy an explanation. And yet every time he stopped by to try and talk to her to perhaps figure out what he was feeling by talking to her, since obviously thinking alone wasn't getting him anywhere, she was always asleep. An implacable marble statue made of auburn hair and soft pink skin and white bandages. At least only to him it seemed. Harvey kept him informed on her condition, and Frank would often talk to her. But whenever he was around, she was asleep. So that led to the attempted bribery of the past week. He would stop by the bakery near his apartment to pick up her favorite pastries (apple streusels, freshly made daily) and would sit by her bedside for as long as he could before work pulled him away. He would always leave the box by her bedside, not wanting to force her to get up to grab it from his office, as that seemed a step too cruel for the answering of a simple question... or in this case a not so simple question.Finally, he realized he wasn't going to make any headway this way, always going to keep seeing the same scene daily, taunting him endlessly. A quick visit to Raelyn Fletcher got the dress, cape, and shoes he needed, all wrapped in a neat box and with a hand written note from him on the bottom. A simple request, and hopefully a good night out of bed for her. He left this box under the box of apple streusel for her to discover when she woke up. And standing in front of her, all he could do was stand for a few moments with a goofy grin glued to his face. Finally realizing what he must look like to her, a fool stuck in his own mind, he dashed off his cap too quickly and messed up his hair. \"You look lovely Juniper.

It is through the work of its Guardsmen, builders, and soldiers that the people of Isra sleep soundly in their beds at night, untroubled by crime, protected from invasion by great walls and mighty legions. Through the work of its traders and merchants, the people of Isra enjoy exotic goods from far-off lands and export their wares for great profit.

And to celebrate the people who make life worth living: our friends, our neighbors, our loved ones, and those closest to us. Let us celebrate each other and everything we do for each other, the people we care about, the time we spend together, and what we are able to achieve as a group.\u201dIn a smooth motion, The Empress lobs the torch onto the log, causing it to erupt in flames.

It was a\u00a0long band of stars, like a galaxy's arm, with little glittering forms easing their way through the air towards the revelers. As it came closer, the single band broke apart and spread across the sky. The lights drifted down into the city like snowflakes, their true form brought into focus.They were seeds, maple-like with helicopter wings spinning through the air. Each seed was imbued with a magical luminescence that was easy on the eyes but bright enough illuminate a patch of snow, stone, or earth, depending on where they eventually landed. The seeds were so numerous that they rain down across the entire city. From a distance, it would seem like a great mist of color was blanketing Isra.While the crowd was distracted, a howl and a screech split open the air.\u00a0Quite without warning, Vaelar Black and Jun of the Celadine, each mounted upon their legendary beasts, sailed down through the cloud, and brought with them a remarkable array of charges. They were birds, hundreds of them, following the pair in thick streams. As soon as Boscoe the Manticore and Blackbean the Giant Crow gave their\u00a0respective signals, the birds ignited, giving off golden flames that did not singe a single feather on their tails, but instead brought gentle warmth and comfort to the beholders. As Jun and Vaelar approached the airspace above the log, they split apart and flew in opposite directions, each covering their own half of the city. A thick trail of birds followed the both of them, so that from the distance which the seeds appeared as a mist, the yule log would seem to extend a warm, fiery embrace out to its beloved city.The performance was meant to be a demonstration of both incredible magical prowess and gentle compassion. Jun had coordinated the entire performance with Vaelar's lack of magical ability in mind. The seeds were ordinary seeds, and the birds were ordinary birds. But through Jun's tutelage and power, they were able to work together to bathe Isra in holy light.In a way this was meant to be a metaphor. While Isra was the head of a mighty empire, it was not merely a destructive force. It was a home for people to be safe from the ravages of the overworld.\u00a0At least, that was the idea in Jun's mind.Once the entire city beheld the great contrails of fire, Jun and Vaelar would arc back towards each other, their\u00a0fleet of avian sky painters carving out a massive golden heart only fully appreciable from high above the city.The seeds, meanwhile glided slowly and in such great numbers that the air would be filled with color for many minutes.

No, not trapped, she reminded herself quickly. Her father was just worried for her safety and wanted the best for her. And it was her home, and he was her father so how could she possibly trapped? That path of thought died though when Vasco said something that drew another small laugh from her and they wandered out into the vast plaza. Her eyes widened yet again as she looked around in wonder at the enormous place. She'd heard again of the place from her nannies, nurses and guards, but she'd never thought that she'd  get to see it.

Her accent was no where near as thick as her father's as she'd been raised in Isra but still there was a slight hum to her words. She was still smiling as she lowered her hand and took Vasco's without hesitation this time. His company was getting more familiar. It felt like she'd known him longer than the few hours she'd spent with him already. \" Nevertheless... I do know how to dance... but I've never really... danced like this.\" She mused, referring to the fact she was in a strange place, with so many strange faces, a strange foreign yet so familiar tune playing. She knew the structure of the waltz and ballroom dance well and she may have learned a more traditional\u00a0dance native to Rondon before her father had gotten wind of it, but she'd never danced outside of the hall in her home at her father's parties.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Loralyn's eyes and ears were open wide as she walked along the avenue with Vasco at her side, she still listened to him dutifully, engaging him with his small talk, and listening as was polite for a lady, but her eyes were full of just wonder.

He used waltz steps and changed the speed, fiddled with the pattern. Forward, side, step, step- a sprinkle of tango. He started slow, became consistent with this new sequence, shifted Loralyn's feet gently with his own until she was used to it, too. His hand was gentle but firm on the small of her back, her one true guide throughout the dance. When it pressed against her, she went forward, and when it left her she chased it, stepping back.Once they were confident with the improvised steps, the real dance began. Step, step- and then he let go, pushing her into a spin while he turned beside her, clapping to the music before they came to face one another and resumed their hold. His head lashed back as he laughed, the glee of the moment getting to him. Now, with the pleasure of being able to focus on her instead of fiddling with the tune, he was able to watch the way her golden hair caught the lantern light around them, or how her clever eyes laid into him. He felt the airiness of her body against his and how her steps feathered one way or the other in tune to his own.He heard her heart, fluttering like a bird in flight. The rush of her blood through those valves nearly drowned out the sound of the music. He drew her in closer, tightened his grip on her hand-- but then there was another. Further away, but just as deafening. He paused their twirling to look up in wide-eyed confusion. It wasn't another dancer. There was something wrong with this heart.After a second of searching he saw her; cloaked in blue and gold, horns sticking up from her hood. His brows pinched. He knew who that was, he swore he did. Perhaps it was the day before?

She was light and nimble and picked up the steps as they came, easily incorporating them into her motions. She had little doubt it had to do with the Rondi blood in her veins that heated and flowed with the notes on the air. She'd always enjoyed the moment of freedom that came with a dance even one as structured and formal as the waltz. But never had it felt this natural to her. From the moment her palm came to slid against Vasco's she was taken. In the beginning yes she felt at a bit of a loss as the styles she knew clashed and melded as Vasco shifted and adjusted and guided her through the motions of this strange dance they moved through. But soon enough as always, her body knew. Vasco's guiding hand hardly did as her motions melded seamlessly with his. Giddiness filled her as spun and twirled and dipped and gave. The hood of the cloak she wore, long since forgotten amidst a gleeful spin. She felt fluid and freer than she ever had and yet... still grounded by the hand that steadied her and drew her back against his chest. It was so different dancing with a man and she suspected that dancing with Vasco would be different than dancing with another man. She felt breathless and yet filled with so much light and life she had no idea what to do with herself. When he slowly drew her back in, tightening his grip on her hand, she swore her heart stopped as she stared up at him. There was some feeling in her chest, she couldn't explain, some tightness and warmth she couldn't help. It burned yet didn't but it spread through her body till she swore she could feel it in her fingertips, to her lips. So stuck in the momentary sensation she hardly noticed his pause and search as she dropped her gaze, her ears burning. Something was strange, she didn't know what she was feeling, she couldn't put a name to it, in fact she was a bit afraid to. But that didn't mean she was afraid of the intense feeling sweeping through her. It was... nice in the strangest of ways. Her thoughts were paused when she heard Vasco's voice cut through the ringing in her ears and she looked back up at him. Even if she wanted to, it was no use trying to hide the happiness in her eyes, and what looked like soft affection for him.

Where are your scales? Your fins? Gills, for that matter?\"His red-orange eyes narrow at her perplexedly. Surely she jests. Cairn has never been excellent at picking up on sarcasm, as the mountain language he came to accept as his first was very, very literal. Still, if what she claims is true...\"Ah, but fish or not, you must be a mighty warrior, small one, if what you say is true. My name is Cairn \u00d3 Fathaigh, Son of the Storm. I am born of Sciobtha, the highest peak of the mountain range your kind calls the Ravenridges, far north.

The man seems much more upbeat now that he's met another who he perceives as sharing his enthusiasm for the hunt.Cairn pauses in thought for a moment, running his gloved fingertips slowly through his coarse beard in thought.\"You know,\" he finally remarks, \"you may get lost in this crowd, your head being so low below the rest. Perhaps you would prefer if I carried you perched upon my shoulder, fish-woman? That way you would not get lost, and we could traverse this ocean of flesh more efficiently.\"He offers her his gargantuan hand, his expression considerably brighter than when they first ran into one another. He is really quite conventionally attractive when he smiles, though his broad facial features are no less intimidating to most.

Whatever the reason, I am glad my homeland will never be this populous.\"He tromps down the side street, heedless of whatever crowds may block his way, although this route is apparently far less popular than the Central Plaza. Finally, they eventually arrive at a homely-looking tavern, the well-maintained Victorian style building of stone and oak inviting the weary traveler and rambunctious scoundrel alike. There are eight windows facing out into the street, four on the first floor, and four just under the cross gabled roof. Steps lead up to a porch where a pair of benches sit on either side of the main entrance under a protective underhang, made for conversing in comfort in the fresh air. Above the main double-doors made of a dark wood hangs a sign that reads, \"The Scarlet Dragon\", with a stylised side profile of a red, fat-bodied, long-necked dragon with two spread wings wrapped about the words. The tavern seems lulled at this time of day, being a primarily night-time business.Cairn offers Deyla a hand to step down off his shoulder, and places her gingerly upon the ground with surprising care.\"This place looks good enough for an evening of epics, don't you agree, fish-woman?\" asks Cairn, looking the place over appraisingly. He'd passed by once before, but it was in the tow of his Lord, and he hadn't had much time to properly examine it. Peering up at the structure now, it's apparent its homely charm is entirely intentional rather than a byproduct of humble ownership, and while it may not be as high-end as the Midnight Sun, its carefully crafted facade and high-quality build makes it clear that the establishment definitely caters to the well-to-do.(We should probably transition to a different location thread after your post)", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Cairn lifts the diminutive maiden by the arm with almost no effort, placing his other gargantuan hand upon her back to keep her from dangling uncomfortably by her extremity.
