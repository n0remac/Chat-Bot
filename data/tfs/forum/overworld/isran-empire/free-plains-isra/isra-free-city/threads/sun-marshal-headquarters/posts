{"post-37724": {"user": "The Isran Empire", "user_num": 1310, "timestamp": "1463233530000", "message": "Once the site of a ramshackle collection of warehouses, the three square acres in the northwestern sector of Isra was purchased and cleared by Lady Naoki to serve as the location of her elite forces, the Sun Marshals. The grass-covered and tree-lined lot houses a large mansion built entirely out of redstone, a substance which is known for its sturdiness and the ease with which it retains magical effects; this is an extremely important factor, given the entire structure is covered with a series of wards designed to protect its inhabitants and defend against attacks both magical and non-magical. With a total of thirty bedrooms, two large kitchens, three living areas, three communal bathing areas, three library-cum-strategy rooms, and an underground training facility spread across four and a half stories, the building serves as both housing for its members and the strategic nerve center for the specialized group of combatants.\u00a0The wards protecting the mansion are very complex and etched into every surface via runes and implanted quartz crystals, both protecting the exterior from attack and helping to keep the interior as unblemished as possible; should an attack be launched upon either the exterior or the interior, the wards automatically alert every Sun Marshal as well as the Lady of Isra, before the protective magics are activated. The exact nature of the magic depends upon the threat-level, which is determined via scrying through the crystals scattered throughout the building, and at that point, the magic is controlled by either of the leaders of the Sun Marshals at the direction of Lady Naoki. The protective magics constantly employed within the building serve to keep the walls, ceilings, and floors undamaged by the various antics and trainings of the Marshals. Perhaps most importantly, the wards protect against magical surveillance, whether it be eavesdropping or scrying, creating a sort of anti-space within the city that make it completely undetectable to magic.\u00a0The double-doors permitting entrance to the main level open onto a foyer which sets the tone for the entire building, its walls and ceilings covered in rich walnut, floored in sturdy oak, and lit by magically-powered sconces and lamps, a theme which is repeated throughout every room in the mansion. The main features of the foyer are a large staircase that leads up to the second and third floors and the topmost half-level, a magical chandelier, and to the right a smaller spiraling staircase that grants access to the mansion\u2019s distinctive small tower. From the foyer, two rooms branch off, one to either side; on the left is that level\u2019s living area, and to the right is that level\u2019s library, both of which are larger and more comprehensive than that of the levels above. The two kitchens are located to the back of the first level, on either side of a rune-inscribed metal door which is the main entrance to the basement training area. This training area is the most heavily-warded of all, a single large room that covers the entire width and length of the structure above it, and filled with an extensive collection of exercise equipment and training tools to be used by the Marshals for keeping themselves sharp. The walls are layered with magic that defends them against any magic that may be cast and any physical attacks, providing a perfectly safe training area. Concealed along the walls in this area are a number of secret passages that lead to tunnels, which connect to important locales within Isra, namely The Midnight Sun, The Moonlight Eclipse, The Citadel, and a very long tunnel that leads directly to The Black Tower, as well as two shorter ones that lead to the stables on the grounds. Adjoined to this training area is a separate sauna and a large room with two pools, one magically heated, one non, and a magically-powered hot tub. \u00a0If one ascends the staircases, they will find the second and third floors, and the uppermost half-level. Each floor has a central hub which is the main living area. Directly north from this room is each floor\u2019s bathing area, and directly west is the library/strategy room, with the stairs accessing the floor being located to the south, and the hallways to the northwest, northeast, east, and southeast each leading to three bedrooms - this is only the case on the second and third levels, as the small half-level above the third houses only six bedrooms which are slightly larger than the rest, serving as housing for the higher-ranking Marshals, or as accommodations for important figures being protected by the Marshals. The living area is plush and comfortable but practical, with an array of tables, chairs, and couches upholstered in the softest, magically protected fabrics in soothing muted jewel tones, for the Marshals to take their leisure. There are cards and games of all sorts kept in supply, including darts and a billiards table, and various popular board games. The libraries are as to be expected, the walls lined with bookshelves which are filled with books on every topic imaginable; while there are a number of chairs and a couple of couches within this room, similar to those in the living area, it is dominated by a large, oval-shaped oak table with six leather chairs along each side and one at each end, serving as the strategic planning center for each library. This table is inscribed with runes that can be activated to provide absolute privacy in the form of two-way soundproofing, anti-scrying, and a protective warding shell. The communal bathing area is actually a large room separated into two zones, one for males and one for females, occupied by (collectively for each level), six bathtubs and six magical showers.\u00a0The operative bedrooms are basic but comfortable, with plain but pleasing mahogany furniture - a single four-poster bed, a desk with chair and magically-powered lamp (the drawers warded so that private documents can be kept safe and only accessed by the room\u2019s owner), a vanity, a dresser, and an armoire. The exact decorations for these rooms can be changed according to the occupant\u2019s desires, but the furniture must remain as-is. Every door is warded to only open in response to the touch of the room\u2019s occupant and the leaders of the Sun Marshals.\u00a0Located within the mansion\u2019s distinctive tower, which is accessible only by the High Marshal, the Administrator, Lady Naoki and her bodyguard Artemis, is a trio of rooms: The office of the High Marshal, the shared coordinating space of the High Marshal and the Administrator, and at the very top, the scrying center and office of the Administrator. This tower is the true nerve center of the Sun Marshals, and as such is the most heavily protected.\u00a0Aside from the main house, there are also two sets of sturdy stone stables. While not as heavily warded as the residence for the operatives, they are still covered in protective spells and runes. One set of stables is for the housing of horses, the other for griffins, and each is staffed with individuals skilled in the care of the animals under their charge.\u00a0Read about the Sun Marshals here.

Because Takhana can See, but she can\u2019t see.

One blueberry, one vanilla with powdered sugar, and the last chocolate with chunks of chocolate interspersed.With the bag placed, Naoki proceeds to seat herself in one of the armchairs, settling her tail up over the right armrest, and taking a half-moment to cross her legs at the knee- more out of habit than anything else, and smooth her skirt.

Apples are... not her favorite fruit. Regardless, it would be a bit awkward to offer it for trade or put it back into the bag at this point, especially so as Takhana is still speaking, so Naoki opts to bite the bullet. Or the muffin, as the case may be. She finds that for whatever reason, the muffin has chosen to accentuate the portion of the apple\u2019s taste that she dislikes the most, the sour sort of tang. Idly, she wonders whyyyyyy. Regardless, she manages to internalize all feelings of disgust, and listens politely as she picks at the muffin, nodding once Takhana has finished. \u201cThat\u2019s all good to hear. I would rather things be going smoothly and largely uneventfully than otherwise. Interesting times and all that.\u201d\u201cThings with me... Are...

They are beginning to get tiring, though. I\u2019ve lost some portion of the enthusiasm I started with. The difficult decisions are starting to come in, along with the political complications.\u201dShe pauses for a moment, constructing her thoughts before continuing,\u00a0\u201cIf I might draw a metaphor for a moment, it\u2019s as if I\u2019m juggling. I cannot, actually, but it is as if I\u2019m juggling, and though I\u2019m not necessarily being thrown new balls to keep in the air, it\u2019s as if the balls are constantly, subtly changing. Getting heavier while they\u2019re in the air. Staying up for longer than they did the last time, floating around a bit, becoming cubic, or developing a coating of slime, that gets onto my hand and then onto the other balls and then all the balls are slimy and my arms are tired I don\u2019t want to juggle anymore as much as I would like to go clean my hands and attend to personal matters, such as marrying Kate, and running away to go live with her in some little cottage in the middle of nowhere where I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about such things as public opinion, my image, the wording on laws and which words I choose to use when speaking, the city\u2019s perception of the ideals it was founded under, what foreign dignitaries think of the dress I\u2019m wearing, and just speaking broadly, politics in general.\u201dShe pauses, realizing that she\u2019s breathing heavily. Consciously, she slows, and takes a few deep breaths for good measure, fully composing herself before continuing, \u201cSo I suppose it is all rather stressful, is what I mean to get at. The issue comes in wherein if the balls hit the floor, civilization as we know it stops functioning, and nobody else in the room knows how to juggle to the degree I think is necessary to juggle the balls.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to prepare successors. Our mutual friend Ms. Untyrid, Jun- who I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ve met, and to a lesser extent, my Skarlet. But I can\u2019t shake the doubt that none of them are ever really going to be prepared, and well suited enough that I would be willing to entrust the nation to them. So I suppose I\u2019m having difficulty accepting the fact that I\u2019m going to be doing this until either I break under the pressure, I die, or am assassinated.\u201d\u201cAnd then I start trying to think about which one of those is most likely to happen first, and it\u2019s a downward spiral from there. \u2026 The worst bit- or rather, one of the worst bits is such that I\u2019m not even doing the job to the extent that I\u2019d really like to be doing it right now, anyway. There\u2019s room for improvement that I can see, and aspire to do, but simply can\u2019t push myself to spend time on. ... I\u2019m sympathising with Ildesias more each day- even with the extensive network of delegation I\u2019ve established. It\u2019s all really quite terrible, if I\u2019m to be honest about it. But there\u2019s nobody else to do it, so I do, and I manage, and the nation functions, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m insane yet.\u201d\u201c... Though if I were, I suppose I wouldn\u2019t know, would I.\u201dAgain, she pauses.

But they\u2019re a department that is designed to deal with pickpockets and thieves. Not so much ancient dragons of questionable allegiance and mental state. I think that Minister Deathforge will be able to recognize that he\u2019s not equipped properly, and accept assistance, provided that it is provided politely, and doesn\u2019t throw its weight around to muddy up his procedures and protocols.

That works out just perfectly.\u201dComplete sarcasm. \u201cI\u2019ll go ahead and get to the point, then. Look at me for a moment.\u201dThis is, of course, a rhetorical. Takhana has been looking at her the entire time. Still, she raises one hand to indicate the side of her own head, and waggles her ears slightly to draw attention to them. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a functioning set of eyeballs or a scrying crystal to see that I\u2019m not quite right. Not quite human. Sub-human or super-human, the distinction is yours so make, but ultimately irrelevant. The question is, however, begged: \u2018What is she?\u2019\u201d\u201cAnd one would think, \u2018Well, she\u2019s a cat\u2026 thing-person. Of some sort. I have never asked, truthfully. But surely Naoki knows what she is. She knows what sort of lingerie Queen Arianne wears, surely she would know something like that.'\u201dNaoki\u2019s voice adopts a smooth sort of edge that is almost reminiscent of Takhana\u2019s own tone as she draws the dialogism, but not not quite so much so as to be mocking, and not quite so accurate as to be an honest-to-goodness impersonation. \u201cJoke being, of course: I do not. The truth of the matter is such that my memories only extend about ten years and a handful of months back from today. And they are me- albeit a somewhat smaller and exceedingly naive me- waking up in an alley.\u201dApparently unable to stay seated, Naoki rises from her seat, and begins to pace off to one side of the room, one hand clasped tightly in the other behind her back. \u201cTo rephrase, I don\u2019t know any more than you- or anyone else, really, what sort of thing I am. And while it would be tempting to assume that I am a creature like Alden\u2019s children- Have you seen them? They\u2019re very cute. Amusingly enough, the one named after me seems to be taking after me in all of the best ways, and it\u2019s amusing. But I digress. While the easy solution would be to assume that I am the product of the love between a human-like being and some manner of anthropomorphic cat-person, the differences extend deeper. Beneath the skin.\u201dHaving reached one side of the room, she begins to pace back, and off to the other side, now using her hands to provide gesticulatory emphasis to each phrase and clause.\u201cHumor me here for a moment, but I\u2019m convinced that I am fundamentally a different sort of thing. For instance, my memory. My memory is perfect. I don\u2019t mean to exaggerate, it simply is. Every bit of sensory input I recognize, I store, I remember, and can recall later without much hassle. Additionally, either as a subset of the last thing or an independent sort of thing, I learn differently. In some cases, very easily. For instance, I learned Gauldish over a weekend. Simply for fun. Yet, when it comes to more\u2026 fiddly things, more intuition based skills, such as plant care, what to wear, cooking\u2026 contractions, I struggle. \u2026\u201d\u201cI recently played a game of chess with Ms. Untyrid. In attempting to consider each available move, each option and evaluate them to choose the most ideal one, I struggled, overwhelmed. There are thousands upon thousands of options. And I realize that that\u2019s not how one is meant to play the game, but I seem to be unable to go about it in any other way. I was able to verbally teach her- who had never even so much as heard the word \u201cchess\u201d before, the theory behind it- enough so that she won our game- but not actually execute the same theory myself. I eventually started to evaluate only fifty possibilities in-between each move, and simply choose one of those. This lead to me getting caught in very simple traps, and losing the game because of it.\u201dThough she doesn\u2019t raise her volume above what might be considered a reasonable level for speaking to someone from across a room, it\u2019s abundantly clear that she\u2019s very frustrated with the whole affair by the irritation seeping into each word, as well as the resentment practically dripping from her voice.\u201cI am the sort to plan and systemize to the point of absurdity, and disregard all aspects of a matter that are seemingly irrelevant to what I am considering. I find it extremely difficult to deal with variables I cannot measure and quantify. My mind functions in a manner that would seem to be entirely unlike every individual I have encountered to date. Even in attempting to understand others, I systemize and form models, which, while sometimes accurate enough for my purposes, still fail regularly, as I cannot form a perfect model of the human mind.\u201d\u201cAnd,\u201d she continues, brandishing a her index finger as one might brandish a rapier, \u201cOn top of that, on top of the ears and the tail and the mind and all, I\u2019m sterile. I could elaborate with all the detail of a mind that never forgets, but you\u2019ll want to just take my word for it, I think.\u201dHaving completed her circuit around the room, Naoki flops backward into her seat in a decidedly unladylike movement. For a few moments, she simply sits, pouting. After a moment, she kicks off her sandals, bringing her feet up to rest on the cushion of the seat. Wrapping her arms about her knees and settling her chin atop one of her lower-arms, she continues, more quietly, but still with that edge of irritation, \u201cIt\u2019s all immensely frustrating. Not knowing what sort of thing I am. Not knowing where I came from, the circumstances that brought me into this world- be they birth, construction, or transportation across the planes. Not knowing if I have ever so much as had any brethren. I squirm in that manner of uncertainty. And the general frustration that comes in operating on a day to day basis! I like to think that I do a reasonable job of hiding it, of coming off as more or less normal. Functioning as most people do in civilised society, going about my business; working, living, loving. \u2026 I actually maintain a model of the person I\u2019d like to be, and use that for interacting with people. But I myself would be much more suited to sitting in a small box and doing mathematical calculations than I would be to attend a ball or the sort of statecraft I do.\u201d The word is uttered with unmasked disgust. \u201cI was hoping that you would be able to work your magic and provide me some facts. I have tried to find facts before. A goodly portion of dear Mr. Cresno\u2019s time was occupied by my searches.\u201dBased upon the fact that she does not continue, it would probably be a safe assumption to presume that Mr. Cresno never found anything in particular.

Marshals answer to nobody but Alden- who you\u2019ve met, Takahana here, and myself. In turn, the two of them answer only to me. The Assembly, Chancellor Greyiron, the rest of Isra\u2019s government, and Isra\u2019s military officers can do no more than make requests of The Marshals.\u201dGradually, Naoki begins to allow her arm to speak as well- the arm with her teacup, no less. Swinging it about, pointing, using motions to punctuate her sentences and provide emphasis to her most important points. \u201cWith this unique sort of spot, The Marshals have a collection of unique responsibilities. Generally speaking, anything of significant priority that cannot be accomplished by the traditional military. To draw a comparison, you can\u2019t drive a nail with a handsaw. Likewise, some jobs cannot be accomplished with legions of spearmen and griffin cavalry. Sometimes, more finesse is required. More discreet agents, more personally talented individuals. Soldiers don\u2019t necessarily make good bodyguards, and sometimes, one needs bodyguards. I\u2019m sure that you can at least identify the niche The Marshals fill, if not perhaps fully understand the depth of it just now. You\u2019ll come to understand more fully in time, I\u2019m sure.\u201dPausing only long enough to take another sip of her tea, Naoki continues to both wave the cup about in enthusiastic gesticulation.

I\u2019m not sure who you\u2019ve met outside of Alden and Takhana, but The Marshals are a fairly motley crew, as far as crews go. In addition to employing individuals skilled in the martial arts, there are doctors, engineers, mages, all sorts of people, hailing from all over. Humans and elves and drow and everything, really. Very meritocratic sort of thing- it doesn\u2019t matter who or what an individual is or are as long as they are  able do the job well.\u201dOpening her mouth as if to continue, Naoki realizes that she\u2019s been going on for quite a bit and that what all she just said is probably a fair bit of  information to take in.

She has no supplementary comments to offer, Takhana having adequately covered the areas she touched on. However, Naoki feels the need to come back around and emphasise a few points under the topic of \u2018training\u2019. \u201cThe majority of the time, there won\u2019t be any designated task or mission for you to attend to. Days and weeks may go by without any major assignments. Even with Ms. Untyrid mentoring you and dictating how you\u2019ll spend your day, and even once your training is \u2018officially\u2019 complete, you\u2019re going to find yourself with many hours to spend. However, as opposed to loafing about and spending your time on idle and meaningless pursuits, you will be expected to spend your time- at least the majority of it- well, by developing and increasing your own capabilities and serving the city in small ways.\u201d\u201cFor example, your penmanship could use work.\u201d With her left hand, Naoki gestures casually to the forms, intending to call Lamina\u2019s less-than-stellar handwriting to attention. Taking another sip of her tea, Naoki finishes her cup and places it down upon the saucer with all due delicacy. \u201cI would suggest that you spend some time reading and writing, practicing, refining your script, in the event you ever have to write anything in the scope of your assignments. Beyond that, and perhaps more importantly, I would also suggest that you spend a fair amount of time familiarizing yourself with Isra- sooner rather than later. As I understand, you\u2019ve only been around for a few days- only since the tournament began or so. To be effective in operating within the city, you are going to need to know how to get from point to point, and know what individuals are referring to when they reference a location or another individual. Spend a few days in exploration for the sake of it. Perhaps Ms. Untyrid would give you a tour.\u201d Naoki shrugs, unsure of how Emahra might decide to do things. Heck, she may not have even been notified yet. It's really too early in the morning to say, Naoki muses. Regardless, Naoki thinks that she\u2019s made her suggestion clear enough. \u201cYour goal should be to become as skilled, well rounded, and well versed as you possibly can be. To be able to intelligently approach any task that might be given you- no matter what it may be, and to have the skills required to deal with it. To quote a man I once knew\u2026\u201dEmploying her skill of impersonation, Naoki adopts the voice of an elderly-sounding gentleman, of the sort you may expect to hear from a duke, or a scholar, perhaps. \u201cAn individual should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, forge metal, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.\u201d Dropping the accent, Naoki continues in her own voice, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be expected to be able to do all of things, of course- that would be somewhat unreasonable and highly arbitrary, but I think I\u2019ve made myself clear. Apply that philosophy to yourself and utilise the resources at your disposal to become the best and most qualified version of yourself you possibly can be.\u201dNaoki punctuates her last statement with a solid nod, indicating that she's finished with that bit.

Truthfully, Naoki had- up until this point, tried to keep an open mind in regards to Goraia. She had tried to open diplomatic negotiations earlier. She had tried to refrain from forming her own opinion without multiple and accurate sources to base it upon. Tried to seriously consider the notion of all of their killing as part of the coup, and had even gone so far as to investigate historical records to see if the coup would be justified for any reason.But this. The Goraian representative won\u2019t have a reasonable explanation for this, because no legitimate excuse for this level of needless, senseless abuse exists! Thinking about it for a moment, Naoki attempts to form a mental list of each sort of abuse mentioned so far. Halfway through, she gets frustrated and stops, taking a moment to clear her thoughts. Because there\u2019s a line. For instance, Naoki, personally, doesn\u2019t really mind tossing people in cells. Sometimes people need to be detained, and that's all well and good. Or roughing up prisoners to get out information that would be beneficial in preventing more crime in the future. Or, even, for that matter, a little bit of torture, if the information in question is valuable enough. Reading minds against one\u2019s will, execution of particularly dangerous prisoners, and life sentences, all fine. All on one side of Naoki\u2019s line, in the \u201cacceptable under circumstances\u201d category. But then there\u2019s that line that separates the preceding category from \u201cviolence for the sake of violence\u201d, \u201cabuse for the sake of abusing\u201d and so on. Just as there is a difference to be noted between the thief who steals bread to live and the thief who steals jewels to live luxuriously, so to is there a difference- at least as far as Naoki is concerned, between the government who detains criminals and miscreants, and the government that imprisons and abuses individuals who have done nothing to them. To know that not only did such things happen in Goraia under their management, but actually directly involved their head of state\u2026 Any level of doubt regarding questionable practices or open mindedness Naoki may have previously possessed regarding Goraia is gone. The notion that perhaps it was just a particularly bloody coup with some rumors- absolutely and totally gone. Her willingness to consider the nation itself as potentially of any use, or even worth dealing with. All whisked away and promptly destroyed; vanished never to be seen again. Just like Lamina\u2019s innocence. And even further beyond that, the specifics of Lamina\u2019s story strikes an excessively personal chord with Naoki. The bit where a young woman is taken against her will, \u201cused\u201d by men, and kept in deplorable conditions for the amusement of those with the power to do such things, specifically. Even though Naoki isn\u2019t usually one to be moved and motivated by emotions, this just rubs her in all of the wrong ways that she cannot even begin to articulate through the red haze.To such an extent, it would seem, to inspire Naoki to abruptly rise from her seat and move off to one of the room\u2019s windows. Standing rigidly before it and gazing out through it, Naoki holds one arm behind her back by grasping its wrist with the other hand. One might notice that the hand belonging to the arm being gripped is slowly changing color. If one might observe her reflection in the mirror, they might notice a small trickle of blood making its way down her chin from her lower lip. Additionally, her earring- her telepathy enabling gemstone, is uncharacteristically quiet, only shining slightly in the sunlight from the window. Naoki, too, is completely silent, save for the deep, shuddering breaths she seems to be forcing herself to take.
