It's a common misconception that their pride and vanity make it easy to pull the wool over their eyes but Maelik knew different. The draconic giants were far from fools, and flattery without reason only made your requests sound even more dubious that normal. And since he knew it was a storm dragon he worked under the assumption that he was either related to or even the same one as the drake from his earlier chore. Either way the demon didn't want to risk utilizing his normal brand of bullshit and decided to go about it bluntly.Staring up at the beast that lounged atop the platform above the Demonlord let loose yet another sigh and allowed his wings to sprout from his disguise before taking off. His wingbeats were far from quiet and any attempt at stealth would have been pointless, as such Maelik merely shot straight for the overhang. Hopefully he'd either find the dragon already awake or at least on the verge of it by the time he landed a safe distance from any sharp pointy appendages, because in all honestly one can never be too careful. What he did find however was nothing at all, which truthfully came as half relief and half irritation. He grumbled and allowed himself to simply fall back down to the ground with a sickening thud. He embraced the pain as his bones shattered and splintered, they would help him focus as he needed to concentrate on healing while he walked on back to The Midnight Sun, hopefully to imbibe in one of those magnificent Hearbreaks.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Maelik looked up at the spire with a sense of growing apprehension.

Why shouldn't Kepesk kill him? Arguably Alden knew he deserved to die his new morals told him as much. He may not have had much or any choice in the things he had done in the past, but he had still done terrible things, monstrous, sadistic terrible things. He was also intruding on Kepesk's property he didn't know why a dragon owned a tower in the middle of the city but it was clearly Kepesk's it was obvious sitting on the balcony that it had been made for the dragon. And why had Alden decided to climb the tower without being seen instead finding out if he was allowed ascend legally. Because it was better to beg forgiveness than ask permission? No Alden knew he had done it because old habits die hard and he thought it would be fun. At the end of the day Alden could not think of a single good reason that the dragon should not simply kill him and be done with it. Heaving a sigh of regret he looks up at Kepesk and say's in a regretful voice.\"My apologies Sir Kepesk I cannot think of a single reason why you should not kill me. Though I have to say...\"Alden surveys the city again rotating on his butt turning away from the dragon so he can take the whole city in as he continues.\"I don't regret my actions. This is truly a view worth dying for.\"Eventually he turns back to face the dragon.\"Plus I got to see a dragon up close so as far as last sights go I am doing great.\"His morose tone dissolves as he says this and his irrepressible grin returns, he continues in the same cheery voice.\"Besides I know I am trespassing but I just wanted to check out the view, I would hope that isn't an offense punishable by death. Though admittedly I don't know much about how dragons view such matters.\"", "link_list": ["/post/14851/thread", "/user/102", "/post/14850/thread", "/user/794", "/user/102", "/user/794"], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/FeTBt7m.jpg", "http://i.imgur.com/xtUYYkE.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@jarkoopi\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/14851/thread\" timestamp=\"1446579483\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-102\" title=\"Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui\"><img alt=\"Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui Avatar\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/FeTBt7m.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/14851/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1446579483000\" title=\"Nov 3, 2015 11:38:03 GMT -8\">Nov 3, 2015 11:38:03 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-102 group-0\" href=\"/user/102\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@jarkoopi\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui</span></a></span> said:</div><div author=\"@alden\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/14850/thread\" timestamp=\"1446576881\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-794\" title=\"Alden Marshal\"><img alt=\"Alden Marshal Avatar\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/xtUYYkE.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/14850/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1446576881000\" title=\"Nov 3, 2015 10:54:41 GMT -8\">Nov 3, 2015 10:54:41 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-794 group-0\" href=\"/user/794\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@alden\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Alden Marshal</span></a></span> said:</div>Alden blinks in surprise as a massive clawed hand plucks him from the balcony.

He could maybe, maybe run away from the dragon if he can get into the city proper but even then it would be close. Still he needed a plan of attack and as far as he can tell he had two options. He could try and sneak to the base of the tower retrieve his gear and get out all hopefully without being seen. The other option was of course not trying to hide his presence at all just walking over to his gear getting it and getting out hoping the dragon either wasn't paying attention or that he wouldn't care. He juggles his options in his mind before settling. \"Ultimately I don't want to test my skills against a dragon. If I am found wanting, it is more likely to take an interest in someone who is trying to avoid attracting attention near it's tower than some random person wandering around. It's a dragon it's got better things to do than investigate everyone it sees in the are right?\"This concludes Alden internal debate on the matter, and so he rises to his feet and casually walk to the area where he left his cloak and boots. Gathering up his meager possessions he then turns around and heads back to the city streets. \"That wasn't so hard.\"He mutters to himself his gear retrieved the dragon hopefully undisturbed.<Alden heads back to the Streets and Alleyways.>", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Alden surveys the Spire from, what he hopes is, a safe distance and he ponders what his plan of action should be.

It was a threat of a downpour on the way, but still of little concern.She came to stop at the end of a stoned path that lead up to a towering spire. Her eyes stopped on the front door, and lifted slowly to the heavens as she took in the construction of the tower. There was a balcony, and a massive one at that. One of her brethren could easily perch up there, and it looked sturdy enough to support one. A few of the windows held no lights - the tower looked dark on the inside. Considering the time of day, it wasn't for the night. Was the place empty?

She flew up against the droplets that descended, and brought herself to that balcony - quick rotation of her wings easing her descent as her boots found the stones.

She would push the door open to find the landing room very plain, near empty. There wasn't a single light within, and very little in terms of furniture. She would slip inside and shut the door behind her - slipping the bolt latch to the side and effectively locking it in her wake. She would bring a hand up and gather her energy into a tight concentration in her palm, soon casting back the darkness with a brilliant ball of fire that manifested in her hand. She found stairs of a wood cut ascending higher, and thick cut stone steps leading below. She took the ones below, and as she left the floor above she saw down into the greeting area below - occasionally broken along the stairs with a few more doors. Storage, and a couple of guest rooms. But still relatively barren, and dusty from lack of occupants. Further down, beneath an old carpet, there was a hidden door to the cellar - which was ominous in feel from the lack of anything down there and no light. The entire place was just so... empty.She shut the cellar door and brought her eyes to the front door. The latch wasn't set - it was unlocked. This place was truly abandoned. Her steps brought her near, and a hand extended to grasp at the bolt latch. She took a breath, and pushed it into place to lock the door - the sound of that metal hitting in place echoing up the empty tower. It felt like a revelation of sorts - she had come in and locked the place down. Did... this make it her tower now? It certainly felt like it. If the place had been clean she would have assumed there were people that lived here... but it was quite the opposite.Zera turned in place and tilted her head, looking up the vacant tower once more. This place had much potential to be a dwelling. Her mind started to piece together how she could shape it... what she might build into the foundation. This entryway could make for a cozy entrance, perhaps a small kitchen. Closest storage for food. The landing above - a study. Maybe even... cut out the wall to the platform for an archway - a proper balcony.She had to laugh and shake her head, clear her thoughts. She was becoming giddy with all the possibilities. In her absolute delight her wings came out and flapped hard to carry her the distance to the top of the spiraling stairs, where she rushed the landing room and the door - unlocking it quickly.
