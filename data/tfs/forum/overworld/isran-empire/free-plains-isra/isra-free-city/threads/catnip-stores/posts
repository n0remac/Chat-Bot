{"post-46239": {"user": "The Isran Empire", "user_num": 1310, "timestamp": "1471073900000", "message": " Located in the east, west, and south of Isra, three clusters of warehouses sit dormant. Each cluster is more or less identical, comprised of between eight and ten large warehouse buildings, an office, and a low wall running around the perimeter of the compound, the wall being intended more to dissuade passersby from wandering in than to deter determined thieves. That\u2019s what the guards are for. Ostensibly, the warehouses are simply one more component of Isra\u2019s ever-expanding industrial infrastructure. It makes sense from economical and industrial perspectives to keep bulk goods on hand in the event of shortages, unexpected demands, and the like. However, the warehouses also serve an ulterior purpose- as a component in Isra\u2019s siege defense. Beyond the private warehouses scattered throughout the city, The Citadel\u2019s storerooms, and private pantries, it makes sense from a strategic perspective for Isra\u2019s government to maintain their own warehouses and stock them with government coin for the benefit of the people in times of war, and the inevitable shortages that come with them. Each day, government workers tend to the warehouses, moving goods in and out, taking regular inventories, and ensuring that everything is kept suitable. Each set of warehouses makes a point to store a fair substantial amount of each designated good, but a level of specialization is in play, and can be described as follows. The warehouses on the south of the city cater primarily to perishables. Breads, cheeses, jars of preserves, dried meats, pickled vegetables, and other foods that can reasonably be kept in bulk for substantial periods of time. The relatively high rate at which the perishables need to be circulated, combined with the south cluster\u2019s proximity to the farms that produce the food make the logistics that much easier. However, not many foods can be kept forever, so the items that are close to spoiling are instead offered at a discount to any citizen who might care to purchase them, with the understood stipulation that the goods in question are most definitely a bit stale. Still, many of Isra\u2019s lower-income residents appreciate the service all the same. The warehouses on the west side of the city specialise in implements and objects.Tools, long lengths of rope, basic furniture, ladders, parchment, and other such miscellaneous assorted goods that would be useful in the event of an emergency. Additionally, this complex also holds one building significantly more sturdily constructed and more heavily guarded than all of the rest: an armory. The warehouses on the east side of the city could really just be called \u2018stockpiles\u2019, due to how they primarily house raw materials. Large stacks of lumber, planks, cut stone, clay, metals, all of the most basic building blocks are held here. Due to Dawnfire Forges\u2019 reliance on these materials, these warehouses were positioned strategically to be within a suitable distance of The Forges and the docks- where the majority of these goods are imported. Additionally, and rather notably, there is one more feature commonly shared across all three warehouse complexes: the cats. Rats have a terrible habit of getting into things, and as it turns out, it\u2019s cheaper to maintain a population of cats than it is to take the damages inflicted by rats. At least, that\u2019s what Empress Naoki   said as she was having the warehouses constructed. However, regardless of the economical effects, the warehouses have cats because she said they would have cats. Dozens upon dozens of cats, at that. However, rather than actually storing catnip as the name implies, patches of catnip are grown in small gardens around each complex. Each night, the cats are fed fish leftovers by \u201cFeline Management and Service Specialists\u201d. Officially, the warehouses are called something along the lines of \u201cIsra\u2019s State-Sanctioned Depots for Goods and Freight Storage,\u201d but nobody can be bothered to remember that, and so the colloquial name has stuck.Regardless, one would be hard pressed to pass by The Catnip Stores without encountering at least one feline- much to the lament of allergic citizens who live in the area.", "link_list": ["/user/607"], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/QkxKZ.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/BnicWRj.jpg"], "html": "<div align=\"center\"> <img alt=\" \" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/QkxKZ.jpg\" style=\"max-width:65%;\"/></div>"}, "post-58543": {"user": "Royal Fletcher", "user_num": 323, "timestamp": "1482209773000", "message": "Roy walked down the street with @robin, heading towards his uncle's shop.
