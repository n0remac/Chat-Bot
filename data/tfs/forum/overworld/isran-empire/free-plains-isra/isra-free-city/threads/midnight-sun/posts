But, if they knew the way, or simply wandered long enough, they would eventually emerge onto a street remarkably similar to one of the many cobble-flagged main promenades, in but one regard - it leads to nowhere at either end.An early construction, this particular street was abandoned when a mismatch in the plans was discovered, rendering the construction far off the beaten path. As the city expanded, it crept up to the lonely road, buildings swirling around the edge of the stone like wild beasts circling a traveler's campfire. Traders set up stalls in the middle, bars squabbled over patrons at the rim, merchants plied their wares throughout, and eventually, this lonely derelict became the center of the underlife of the city.A sort of Grand Bazaar serving the poor, the criminal, the privacy-seeking, and the morality-free, this area became known simply as the Nexus - so named for the fact that all of the city\u2019s alleyways seemed to eventually run back into it, orbiting around this central mass of debauchery. At the present day, the street is a maelstrom of exotic smells wafting from the food vendors, sounds of shouting and haggling from the shoppers, and drunken songs and soft lighting spilling out of the bars and brothels rimming the strip. At night, floating orbs in all colors of the rainbow cast a kaleidoscopic glow over the people beneath.At the middle of the Nexus stands a rather new-looking building, set apart from its fellows by the quality of its construction, and the immaculate aesthetic that it presents. As the door opens, disgorging a happy-looking patron, laughter and music sound a fanfare to his departure. The air that escapes smells of spices and mystery, fine liquor and well-used cards, love and lust and seduction. This establishment, standing over the Nexus like a queen over her subjects, is the Midnight Sun. Its doors never close, for the sun never sets on debauchery.If a traveler were to enter, they would find themselves in the main bar area - a large rectangular room, extending upwards some three stories to touch the feet of the figures in an exquisite mural. At the second-floor level, wide balconies with ornately carved wooden banisters and railings line the left and right sides. The right-hand balcony is reserved for favored patrons, and contains high-backed booths with plush benches. Runic arrays inside the benches ensure that the conversations held in them remain confidential.The main floor is covered with round tables and ringed with booths, except for a cleared area in front of a small stage located at the back of the room. On the left side of the room stands the centerpiece of the whole establishment: the bar. Ornate stools belly up to a thick slab of mirror-finished ebony, hewn from a single tree, that runs almost the entire length of the building. Bottles of every possible shape and size fill shelves that tower up to the ceiling. Bartenders dressed in immaculate white suits bustle about behind it, attending to the unquenchable thirsts of the patrons.On the main floor, serving girls flit between tables, ferrying liquid pleasure and liquid ruin to their requesters. At one table, a group of landed gentry are holding a rousing discussion on the proper method of taxing trade. At another, a group of wealthy-seeming men are relaxing in the arms of stunningly -and in one case, scantily- dressed women with orange gems prominently displayed on silver bracelets.To the left, the bar falls away into another large room. From it, the clink of tokens and the swish of cards being dealt mingle with exultant cries and despondent groans. Sharply-dressed employees in black suits deal red-backed cards onto rich green felt. Patrons cluster around gaming tables. At the side of the room, a woman exits a doorway, a heavy leather bag clutched in her hand. A very remarkable and strangely indistinct gentleperson waves goodbye to her from inside the office. On the desk in front of him, a bottle glows faintly.At the far end of the bar, a wide set of stairs, accessible from the casino or the main floor, winds its way up into the building. Behind it on the ground floor, a door marked \u201cEmployees Only\u201d stands vigil at the head of the stairway to the basement.The second floor contains rooms and suites, suitable for rest, privacy, or engagements of a more carnal nature. A balcony over the bar provides access to a set of hallways serving the rooms, and an out-of-the-way location with a few tables, frequented by those desiring less proximal clamor.Any average patron making their way to the third floor would likely turn right around and head back downstairs. A long hallway sits at the top of the stairs, the dark, rich woods of its construction sheathed in plush red carpet, and hung with tapestries and paintings. The roar of the crowd below is but a dull murmur here, like distant waves crashing on the beach. Silver doorknobs dot the walls at long intervals. Those who come here uninvited quickly gain an uncomfortable sense that they do not belong here. These are the offices - the nerve center of the Midnight Sun.At the right of the main room, a set of soundproofed double doors leads to the inn. The roar of the bar dies away as one enters, giving rise to a more comfortable and secure atmosphere. Immediately to the left of the doors, the inn\u2019s main desk changes the currencies of the lands into Midnight Sun tokens and handles room reservations. Homey square tables fill the center of the room. At the back, a twin set of doors leads to the kitchen.To the right of the desk, a staircase leads to the second and third level - the rooms. These hallways are clad in warm-colored woods and rich red carpets. At intervals, brass doorknobs mark the entrances to the rooms. The interiors are well-appointed, but not richly so. Their general quality is higher than that of the rooms over the bar, as befits their respective purposes.There are many other rooms in the building, of course, serving myriad purposes. Those, the general public will likely never know about.[========================================================]The Midnight Sun uses a unique currency, called Midnight Sun Tokens. These coins come in four denominations, each one increasing by a magnitude of ten. In order of least to most valuable, they are called Moons, Suns, Eclipses, and Novas. Only these tokens are accepted as payment for extra services within the Midnight Sun, with the one exception being the bar. At the front desk, one may speak with the exchange clerk to exchange anything of value for Midnight Sun Tokens, including other currencies, jewelry, and solid metal. Exchange is also possible in the other direction, one may exchange tokens for the major currencies of the world. The exchange rate is reasonable, and if one were to do the math, they would find the services fairly priced.For purposes of cost estimation, one Moon may be considered approximately equal to 1 USD. One Sun is approximately equal to 10 USD, etc.[========================================================]Patron Menu- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Specialty Beverages- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Heartbreak - Our signature beverage!

After several long moments of silence, she finally settled on something. \"What, exactly, would I be doing here if we were to work together? I have to admit, from what Madame Naoki said, I'm very intrigued. It sounds almost as if this is a vast and intricate spy network.\"Despite her vaguely amused tone, Takhana was dead serious. Operatives, gems that link people telepathically, potentially dangerous missions... It was all very.. strange. But it didn't deter her. As long as they were working for good, she was still very interested. But a better idea of what she'd be doing were she to work in conjunction with Reese would give her a more solid grasp on whether or not she wanted to say yes. She was about eighty percent sure she would; she just wanted a reason to give that last twenty.Reese clasped his hands together, leaning forwards slightly and presenting an earnest front.

Now, inevitably a large enough system will acquire its fair share of detractors, nay-sayers, or even some people that intend some more... direct harm. It's my job to dissuade them.\"\"The thought of taking a human life is anathema to me. It may be the most efficient option in a fair few situations, but it will never be the cleanest. Blackmail. Reallocation of property. Calling law enforcement. Framing a person. Most of these are immoral, it's true, but it ends a potentially dangerous situation without causing undue or irreparable harm to either side.\"\"All of these options require information. Knowing a person's dirty secrets, looking up records and grants, finding the time to call security, learning their vices and what accusation could stick them. Information is a weapon I will happily wield.\"Reese leaned back into his chair and straightened his jacket, which had gotten askew in the midst of his speech. \"The whole 'security and protection' gig is the most important duty of the department, but we generally try to be of use in knowledge-related matters. Let's say the Madame is going out to negotiate with a fellow, and she's never heard of him. If we've done out digging, we'll be able to tell her who he is, what his interests are, maybe slip in a few weaknesses for good measure. Similarly, if an Operative needs to know about a person, type of magic, strange profession, or some other snippet of information... Well. Having that available to them can be ever-so-convenient.\"\"I realize I didn't quite answer your question. You wanted to know what you, personally, would be doing in all of this.

From there, the shadow of the Chieftan's feet were seen below the door, at the gap from the floor and itself. A whispering world, sounding from a mix of choking and coughing within a whisper, a glow of green occurred, and opening the door was a glowing, three-fingered hand, fading once the door opened all the way.From this point in time, the Chieftan was seen. A face wrinkled with battle cries from long ago, scarred with rage and stressful times in his eyes, and overall, a posture of aggravation. Yet, he seemed calm, his mouth barely parted as he inhaled and exhaled weakly, looking straight to Madame Naoki, practically ignoring Aithen in the corner of the room, standing tall with a fist clasped to his chest, back straight, and eyes to the header above the doorframe.

He could feel something unnatural about her, and if his time in Asgeir told him anything about the unnatural, it was to tread warily when around such paranormal.

His eyes traveled to Aithen for a moment, before returning to Naoki's to lock once more, his own flexing a bit with surprise at that term. From there, he waited a moment, before bringing his own fist up to his chest, firmly resting as he responded with his own voice.\"Hail, Thuri.\"From there, his voice was quite powerful. It wasn't too deep, yet held a masculine level of volume. He seemed older than he was, and his voice appeared to have been warned out at one point, due to the low grumbling sound emitted during the 'Hail' part of the greeting. Either that, or he still has trouble with the English tongue.From there, the Chieftan spread his fist to a flat hand, resting it against his chest and lowering it to signal the end of the salutation. Shyly, the Chieftan marched forward, looking down next to him (To his right) to see the chair he was offered to sit in. His head pivoted to look back up to Naoki for a moment, exhaling through his calm nostrils as he nodded weakly, sitting down. From there, his back was straight (possibly not even touching the back rest), his chest was puffed out, his eyes remaining to lock onto hers, yet kept his head as level as possible while doing so.As he sat down, however, his muscles rippled within his legs, flexing and tensing up with even the smallest of movements. His skirt folded more in between his legs, the skull as its buckle pushing the top of its horns into his midsection, right against the outer sides of his abs. The scars upon his body could be viewed now to be more of indents: Deep, fatal wounds even possibly viewed to have subsided and rejuvenated from whatever concoctions or spells the Frok'Nold have used for so long. At this point in time, his mighty, battle-worn eyes looked up and down upon Naoki, gesturing with a weak raise of his hand for her to do the same. \"It is tradition we are allowed one look upon the entirety of the body before our words escape it.\"\u00a0Thorok spoke once more, his face continuing it's slightly angry, yet neutral, stare to her eyes, waiting for her to view him. One would guess what he meant as \"words escaping the body\" as he spoke just at that time to explain it. But truly, it was a reference to the beginning of the meeting and its issues.\u00a0\"I bear no dagger, on my honor.\" This would give off a hint of why this tradition was as so. Many times in the past had \"peaceful\" meetings gone to a hidden weapon thrown at the other, or perhaps unwanted gazes down to the rest of the body upon later time during the meeting.\"....What do you know, of my people?\" Questioned the now deeper voice of Thorok. His eyes narrowed down to Naoki in interest, flickering over to witness Artemis in the same form as Aithen was on the other side of the room. He appreciated it, yes, but he would have to speak to Aithen later on due to this unneeded force upon their own tradition of greeting.Madame Naoki stands and watches quietly as Thorok repeats the greeting, speaks, and seats himself. If her mind could be compared to a gearbox, one might be able to hear it whirring away, well oiled rotations of finely cut gears struggling to fully observe and analyze all of Thorok\u2019s actions. In situations such as these, where she has little to information, Naoki finds herself forced to rely on improvisation and on-the-spot decision making. Further, in such high-stakes situations as these, she doesn\u2019t much like having being forced in that way. Only a few minutes before, she had been reviewing information on King Renaux, so she wouldn\u2019t have to do this same sort of thing tomorrow. However, if she\u2019s good at anything, she\u2019s good at analyzation. The first thing that she notes is that Thorok is very careful not to break eye contact for any extended length of time. She has no idea of the symbolism behind this, but assumed it to be related to respect, and figures it best not to break the trend. Proceeding forward, she will be careful not to break eye contact. As he sits and states that he is unarmed, she hesitates for a moment before reaching to the pouch on her hip, and fumbles with the string holding it to her hip. Without looking at it, she takes a moment to undo the know, but dexterous fingers prevail in the end, and place the pouch on the desk to her side. The gems inside clink slightly as it finds a resting position atop a stack of books. Though it doesn\u2019t resemble any conventional weapon, some of the gems in there are capable of flattening towns, and are definitely weapons in the sense that they could be used to easily take action to disable Thorok. Though she doesn\u2019t usually disarm herself when speaking to others, and even has a habit of fooling with gems as she speaks, that habit will need to be curbed for this meeting. Regardless of the purpose of his visit or what comes of it, Thorok seems to be an incredibly intense sort of individual, and she assumes that her meeting with Renaux tomorrow will be significantly more casual than this. If things do end up turning sour, the inability for her to utilize the gems will not be a significant strategic loss, their power and applicability is trivial when compared to Reese\u2019s defensive magics across the hall. Even now, she feels a slight tickling on her lower back as he silently flexes his abilities, as it were. Moving from the desk, she breaks eye contact momentarily to glance down at the seat to the left of the door. She looks back up at Thorok, and states the truth, \u201cI too, am unarmed.\u201d With that, she seats herself, carefully weaving her tail through the space between the cushion and backrest, and resting her hands in her lap. At this point, it is worth congratulation that Madame Naoki maintains her composure. She looks across to Thorok, the hulking, 7\u20194\u201d sort of terribly muscular orcish individual that he is, simply sitting there in her guest chair a measly four feet from her. The whole encounter brings to mind a similar situation- when she first met Maelik. Though she supposes that Thorok would find it massively disrespectful if she burst out laughing as she did then, with any luck, this should turn out into an equally mutually prosperous relationship. When he poses his question, Naoki waits a half-moment before answering, considering. When she speaks, it is in her own, relatively light tone, with inflections of neutrality and respect. \u201cI do not know very much about your people. I have heard of a settlement called Falkreath, and have heard some firsthand accounts from visitors, and some legends that would seem to be referring to your people. However, I cannot say that I truly know your people.\u201dShe sits quietly and awaits his response, or lack of it. If he chooses not to speak, she would continue, but figures what she said to be sufficient enough for the moment.", "link_list": ["/post/30377/thread"], "image_list": ["//storage.proboards.com/6046952/images/uCQvKjMwQCSfGa7d4dCT.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@thorok\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/30377/thread\" timestamp=\"1459075841\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-0\" title=\"thorok\"><img alt=\"thorok Avatar\" src=\"//storage.proboards.com/6046952/images/uCQvKjMwQCSfGa7d4dCT.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/30377/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1459075841000\" title=\"Mar 27, 2016 2:50:41 GMT -8\">Mar 27, 2016 2:50:41 GMT -8</abbr></a>  @thorok said:</div>The Chieftan stood there, observing the salutation.

After a short delay, it swings inward on creaking hinges, revealing yet again the form of Madame Naoki herself. Her desk is still piled high with books and documents pertaining to tomorrow\u2019s trip, and her hair is done up into a small, spiral sort of bun on the back of her head. This configuration draws to attention to the lack of ears on the sides of her head- she\u2019s found that some find it unsettling. It isn\u2019t so much the addition of non-human body parts, but the absence of such a common one. Regardless, Naoki is past caring at this point; she has no appointments scheduled right now, any visitors are invited, and will have to deal with her appearance as it is. The first person she sees as the door opens is Skarlet, there in her outfit. Naoki begins to smile, but also pans her gaze downward, and sees the twins.

She placed a bookmark in the tome currently occupying the forefront of her workspace, and moves it to one side. Assuming that Skarlet sits, Naoki leans back in her chair, planting her feet up on one corner of the desk, and begins her explanation. \u201cTo answer your question simply, milk of the sort that human infants drink comes from the mother\u2019s breasts. However, let me give you a bit of context to explain that answer. First of all, this following information only pertains to mammals, as they are regularly understood. That means\u2026 things that have hair, and breasts. Creatures like you and me, but also things like cows, and\u2026 bears\u2026 and cats and dogs and horses and such. Not fish, not birds, not reptiles, not undead, nor animated skeletons or dragons or any of that nonsense.\u201d\u201cCreatures that are mammals give birth to their young, in a manner that is, generally speaking, essentially the same as the human reproductive system we discussed previously, with the eggs and all that. You figure, after that, once the infant is born, it falls to the mother to provide for the infant until it is capable of operating and sustaining itself autonomously. That means feeding it, taking care of it, protecting it from danger, and generally taking steps to ensure the child survives until adulthood. \u2026 Hmm. Have you ever seen a newborn child, Skarlet?\u201dAs Naoki poses her question, she raises one eyebrow in Skarlet\u2019s direction.

Well, you\u2019re not missing much, but you should probably refer to a book or go find one to have a look at later. However, for the purposes of our discussion, imagine a little person\u2026 at birth, human babies usually tend to range between two and a half kilograms to four and a half kilograms. Little, tiny things, maybe\u2026\u201dNaoki flattens her hands and holds them out to indicate a distance of about forty centimeters. \u201cThis big, though they vary in size some. Not very large at all. Also not very strong, or capable of doing anything much at all by themselves. This early on in development, the infant\u2019s body- brain and all, is still growing at an incredible pace, but doesn\u2019t yet have the capacity to do really much of anything. They have to be, as the term has been named, babied. To be cared for, treated, pampered. In almost all scenarios, the responsibility for caring for the child goes to the mother. In some cases, the father may take a large role, and midwives are a thing that exist, but generally speaking, it\u2019s up to the mother.\u201d\u201cTo return to your question, as I stated, one of the responsibilities of the mother is to feed the child. At this point, the infant\u2019s mouth and digestive system are not capable of processing solid foods at all. They don\u2019t even have teeth yet, those come in later. They cannot chew or digest anything that isn\u2019t a liquid. And, on top of that, there are only a small handful of liquids that are nutritious enough to sustain the rapid development of a newborn child, and all but one of them can be mixed by Kevin. That one remaining liquid that Kevin cannot create is breast milk. You see, one of the changes that occurs in a mother\u2019s body during the process of pregnancy and childbirth is lactation. Lactation means, essentially, to secrete milk, and\u2026 well, women do that.\u201d\u201cYou figure, the nipples, the little raised bits on one\u2019s breasts...\u201d She indicates by tapping her fingers on the front of her sweater. \u201cThey secrete milk following childbirth. The idea then is to hold the infant sort of like this\u2026 and they go ahead and suck it out.\u201d She continues to pantomime, holding one arm in the other and mimicking the clamping lips of an infant with two fingers. \u201cThe mother\u2019s milk is the infant\u2019s single source of nutrition for about the first six months after birth. Past that point, through a process known as weaning, the mother then begins to supplement the child\u2019s diet with other things. Usually mashed fruits and vegetables, things that are runny and liquid. At this point, though the child\u2019s digestive system is advanced enough to handle some things other than breast milk, it still has a hard time with some things, and feeding the baby the wrong thing at this point will at least end with a very upset stomach, and at worst leave the child with a serious health issue. One must be very, very careful with young children, in matters of food, and in all other respects. One mistake or show of neglect may evolve into a very serious problem, and endanger the life of the child. Unfortunately, due to this massive vulnerability in the early stages of life, a depressingly large number of human children do not reach adulthood.\u201dHere, Naoki pauses for a moment, closing her eyes apparently in mourning, before continuing. \u201cBut I digress. Human children drink from their mother\u2019s breasts for the first half year or so after being born, before gradually switching to other sorts of food, and eventually becoming able to consume the regular sorts of things humans tend to. The process of female lactation is almost always related to pregnancy, though it can be induced with some manners of drugs, and is sometimes seen in adoptive mothers. Most probably something to do with feelings, I imagine. Other sorts of mammals also use this same process, and it is through the efforts of ranchers milking their livestock, notably cows, goats, and sheep, that we get milk to drink. I really don't know how you even intend on having a child in the first place, if you'd begin to lactate, or if the vampire children would need blood, so I can't help you much there, but does that adequately answer your question?\u201dNaoki fixes Skarlet with another look and raised eyebrow, still leaning back in her chair and crossing her arms over her chest.

His eyes traveled to Aithen for a moment, before returning to Naoki's to lock once more, his own flexing a bit with surprise at that term. From there, he waited a moment, before bringing his own fist up to his chest, firmly resting as he responded with his own voice.\"Hail, Thuri.\"From there, his voice was quite powerful. It wasn't too deep, yet held a masculine level of volume. He seemed older than he was, and his voice appeared to have been warned out at one point, due to the low grumbling sound emitted during the 'Hail' part of the greeting. Either that, or he still has trouble with the English tongue.From there, the Chieftan spread his fist to a flat hand, resting it against his chest and lowering it to signal the end of the salutation. Shyly, the Chieftan marched forward, looking down next to him (To his right) to see the chair he was offered to sit in. His head pivoted to look back up to Naoki for a moment, exhaling through his calm nostrils as he nodded weakly, sitting down. From there, his back was straight (possibly not even touching the back rest), his chest was puffed out, his eyes remaining to lock onto hers, yet kept his head as level as possible while doing so.As he sat down, however, his muscles rippled within his legs, flexing and tensing up with even the smallest of movements. His skirt folded more in between his legs, the skull as its buckle pushing the top of its horns into his midsection, right against the outer sides of his abs. The scars upon his body could be viewed now to be more of indents: Deep, fatal wounds even possibly viewed to have subsided and rejuvenated from whatever concoctions or spells the Frok'Nold have used for so long. At this point in time, his mighty, battle-worn eyes looked up and down upon Naoki, gesturing with a weak raise of his hand for her to do the same. \"It is tradition we are allowed one look upon the entirety of the body before our words escape it.\"\u00a0Thorok spoke once more, his face continuing it's slightly angry, yet neutral, stare to her eyes, waiting for her to view him. One would guess what he meant as \"words escaping the body\" as he spoke just at that time to explain it. But truly, it was a reference to the beginning of the meeting and its issues.\u00a0\"I bear no dagger, on my honor.\" This would give off a hint of why this tradition was as so. Many times in the past had \"peaceful\" meetings gone to a hidden weapon thrown at the other, or perhaps unwanted gazes down to the rest of the body upon later time during the meeting.\"....What do you know, of my people?\" Questioned the now deeper voice of Thorok. His eyes narrowed down to Naoki in interest, flickering over to witness Artemis in the same form as Aithen was on the other side of the room. He appreciated it, yes, but he would have to speak to Aithen later on due to this unneeded force upon their own tradition of greeting.Madame Naoki stands and watches quietly as Thorok repeats the greeting, speaks, and seats himself. If her mind could be compared to a gearbox, one might be able to hear it whirring away, well oiled rotations of finely cut gears struggling to fully observe and analyze all of Thorok\u2019s actions. In situations such as these, where she has little to information, Naoki finds herself forced to rely on improvisation and on-the-spot decision making. Further, in such high-stakes situations as these, she doesn\u2019t much like having being forced in that way. Only a few minutes before, she had been reviewing information on King Renaux, so she wouldn\u2019t have to do this same sort of thing tomorrow. However, if she\u2019s good at anything, she\u2019s good at analyzation. The first thing that she notes is that Thorok is very careful not to break eye contact for any extended length of time. She has no idea of the symbolism behind this, but assumed it to be related to respect, and figures it best not to break the trend. Proceeding forward, she will be careful not to break eye contact. As he sits and states that he is unarmed, she hesitates for a moment before reaching to the pouch on her hip, and fumbles with the string holding it to her hip. Without looking at it, she takes a moment to undo the know, but dexterous fingers prevail in the end, and place the pouch on the desk to her side. The gems inside clink slightly as it finds a resting position atop a stack of books. Though it doesn\u2019t resemble any conventional weapon, some of the gems in there are capable of flattening towns, and are definitely weapons in the sense that they could be used to easily take action to disable Thorok. Though she doesn\u2019t usually disarm herself when speaking to others, and even has a habit of fooling with gems as she speaks, that habit will need to be curbed for this meeting. Regardless of the purpose of his visit or what comes of it, Thorok seems to be an incredibly intense sort of individual, and she assumes that her meeting with Renaux tomorrow will be significantly more casual than this. If things do end up turning sour, the inability for her to utilize the gems will not be a significant strategic loss, their power and applicability is trivial when compared to Reese\u2019s defensive magics across the hall. Even now, she feels a slight tickling on her lower back as he silently flexes his abilities, as it were. Moving from the desk, she breaks eye contact momentarily to glance down at the seat to the left of the door. She looks back up at Thorok, and states the truth, \u201cI too, am unarmed.\u201d With that, she seats herself, carefully weaving her tail through the space between the cushion and backrest, and resting her hands in her lap. At this point, it is worth congratulation that Madame Naoki maintains her composure. She looks across to Thorok, the hulking, 7\u20194\u201d sort of terribly muscular orcish individual that he is, simply sitting there in her guest chair a measly four feet from her. The whole encounter brings to mind a similar situation- when she first met Maelik. Though she supposes that Thorok would find it massively disrespectful if she burst out laughing as she did then, with any luck, this should turn out into an equally mutually prosperous relationship. When he poses his question, Naoki waits a half-moment before answering, considering. When she speaks, it is in her own, relatively light tone, with inflections of neutrality and respect. \u201cI do not know very much about your people. I have heard of a settlement called Falkreath, and have heard some firsthand accounts from visitors, and some legends that would seem to be referring to your people. However, I cannot say that I truly know your people.\u201dShe sits quietly and awaits his response, or lack of it. If he chooses not to speak, she would continue, but figures what she said to be sufficient enough for the moment.The Chieftan looked to the gems for a small second or two, pupils dilating as he returned his gaze to her, eyes softening as she spoke her piece. As she sat down, his peripheral view gazed to the ears and the tail tucked in. Indeed, she was of an oddity, nothing to his recollection compared to her appearance. As expected, but still not appreciated, her response came to rejecting the familiarity of the Frok'Nold. As she spoke, she could view his bottom lip along with his tongue clenched mightily by the teeth within, eyes dilating for a moment before letting go.The small moment of his own tantrum passed, and he inhaled heavily through his lungs before he began his response. \"I am not shocked by your response, nor affected. It is the simple expectation in this new world, to forget that which brought man to his mighty realm... The All-Maker as well my people below your wooden and royal floors demand me to speak of them.\" From there, his throat was cleared as quiet and formal as possible, his chest flexing further as his hands clasped onto his kneecaps firmly now.\"Our people are the Frok'Nold, to you, the Stone Orcs.. We have watched the realm grow but yet, we have decided to remain secluded. Our king, Mathladeem, who I am named after.. he had left us in his years of Isolation.. What do you know of magic? Its potential is infinite, yes? And the beings it births share the same characteristic. From here, from this potential birthed our earth's regulation: Rag'Novok. His name carries a gravity this world has forgotten. These beings, like Rag'Novok, were meant to postpone the growth of any nations to preserve the life of other sentient beings. Man has grown to such a population because they have disappeared, as our birther Mathladeem slayed every one of them. But yet, Rag'Novok was the key to his Isolation. He ignored the Stone Dragons' purpose in existence, and had slain the last of them, using his heart to form the Claws of Maffle'Kog: A tool, which harnessed the magical capabilities of the Frok'Nold. With this.. Mathladeem tore through the horizon, separating the skies from the mountains to form a portal, a bridge to another dimension in fear of Your people.\"\u00a0Thorok paused for a moment, hearing the intensity in his voice pick up, dropping down to a calmer tone. \"Because of the growth of Man, the Frok'Nold left this world. But yet, we were left behind. Our Great Elder: Shorbolg, you know of him. He protected us, in favor of our race, and birthed a tribe for the remaining Frok'Nold to exist. From here, we have watched Man. Medan, a once favored people, consumed in darkness and lost of the All-Maker's view, and now, it has come that my years of command have failed me. The years of Isolation are collapsing, and now I have a new objective.\"Ending his story, his shoulder rotated before speaking once more, swallowing which sent a thick, bulging Addam's Apple up and down once. \"I have come here in interest of those who you've sent to my aid. Those who have retreated from the Call they made oath to complete, to question the intentions your people had taking up serious matters.\" From here, the right hand of the Chieftan rotated so the palm faced the air, fingers barely curled as it presented her turn to speak, and he went quiet.", "link_list": ["/post/30521/thread", "/user/607", "/post/30377/thread"], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/jxxfhPa.jpg", "//storage.proboards.com/6046952/images/uCQvKjMwQCSfGa7d4dCT.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@madamenaoki\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/30521/thread\" timestamp=\"1459153096\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-607\" title=\"Empress Naoki\"><img alt=\"Empress Naoki Avatar\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/jxxfhPa.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/30521/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1459153096000\" title=\"Mar 28, 2016 0:18:16 GMT -8\">Mar 28, 2016 0:18:16 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-607 group-0\" href=\"/user/607\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@madamenaoki\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Empress Naoki</span></a></span> said:</div><div author=\"@thorok\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/30377/thread\" timestamp=\"1459075841\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-0\" title=\"thorok\"><img alt=\"thorok Avatar\" src=\"//storage.proboards.com/6046952/images/uCQvKjMwQCSfGa7d4dCT.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/30377/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1459075841000\" title=\"Mar 27, 2016 2:50:41 GMT -8\">Mar 27, 2016 2:50:41 GMT -8</abbr></a>  @thorok said:</div>The Chieftan stood there, observing the salutation.

Proceeding forward, she will be careful not to break eye contact. <br/><br/>As he sits and states that he is unarmed, she hesitates for a moment before reaching to the pouch on her hip, and fumbles with the string holding it to her hip. Without looking at it, she takes a moment to undo the know, but dexterous fingers prevail in the end, and place the pouch on the desk to her side. The gems inside clink slightly as it finds a resting position atop a stack of books. Though it doesn\u2019t resemble any conventional weapon, some of the gems in there are capable of flattening towns, and are definitely weapons in the sense that they could be used to easily take action to disable Thorok. Though she doesn\u2019t usually disarm herself when speaking to others, and even has a habit of fooling with gems as she speaks, that habit will need to be curbed for this meeting. Regardless of the purpose of his visit or what comes of it, Thorok seems to be an incredibly intense sort of individual, and she assumes that her meeting with Renaux tomorrow will be significantly more casual than this. If things do end up turning sour, the inability for her to utilize the gems will not be a significant strategic loss, their power and applicability is trivial when compared to Reese\u2019s defensive magics across the hall. Even now, she feels a slight tickling on her lower back as he silently flexes his abilities, as it were. <br/><br/>Moving from the desk, she breaks eye contact momentarily to glance down at the seat to the left of the door. She looks back up at Thorok, and states the truth, \u201cI too, am unarmed.\u201d With that, she seats herself, carefully weaving her tail through the space between the cushion and backrest, and resting her hands in her lap. At this point, it is worth congratulation that Madame Naoki maintains her composure. She looks across to Thorok, the hulking, 7\u20194\u201d sort of terribly muscular orcish individual that he is, simply sitting there in her guest chair a measly four feet from her. The whole encounter brings to mind a similar situation- when she first met Maelik. Though she supposes that Thorok would find it massively disrespectful if she burst out laughing as she did then, with any luck, this should turn out into an equally mutually prosperous relationship. <br/><br/>When he poses his question, Naoki waits a half-moment before answering, considering. When she speaks, it is in her own, relatively light tone, with inflections of neutrality and respect. \u201cI do not know very much about your people. I have heard of a settlement called Falkreath, and have heard some firsthand accounts from visitors, and some legends that would seem to be referring to your people. However, I cannot say that I truly know your people.\u201d<br/><br/>She sits quietly and awaits his response, or lack of it. If he chooses not to speak, she would continue, but figures what she said to be sufficient enough for the moment.<br/><br/><div class=\"quote_clear\"></div></div></div>"}, "post-30679": {"user": "Skarlet", "user_num": 257, "timestamp": "1459216298000", "message": "Mar 28, 2016 4:23:18 GMT -8 Empress Naoki said:\u201cGood, that\u2019s the goal.

I am doing quite well so far, thank you! Though my shift has only just started, seeing you is an excellent start!\u201dIn one fluid motion, he snaps his fingers, points at Leona, and winks one eye. However, as she poses her question, he wastes no time in continuing the motion he had started on their first meeting, spreading his arms wide and gesturing to the area at large.\u00a0\u201cFind work? Why, you\u2019re in THE place to get a job! It doesn\u2019t matter what field you\u2019re looking to go into, The Midnight Sun is the biggest employer in Isra!\u201dThough he seems pleased to have had the opportunity to finish it this time, Cecil places a hand on his chest, and continues in a more reasonable conversational tone. \u201cI can personally attest, Madame Naoki, she treats her employees well, if nothing else. I am among the more senior of employees here; I\u2019ve been working\u2026 coming on three years, now. Anniversary is next August. Never once have I been dissatisfied with my treatment here. The work is steady, the pay is good, and I, personally, have found a very good fit in this job. My leg\u2026 My leg isn\u2019t very good.\u201dHe taps on the counter, indicating his legs beneath, though he does not stand. If Leona were able to see through the countertop, and through his pants, it would be apparent that Cecil\u2019s leg is a bit unnaturally structured. Perhaps mangled, perhaps deformed, hard to say. \u201cFor the longest time, I was unable to walk. I found a job here early on, mostly by circumstance. Got in very nearly on the ground floor, as it were. She sat me behind the bar, and I worked as a barhand for a while. It was alright, but I couldn\u2019t get around real well to serve people, and never quite got the hang of mixing drinks. Last year, this Inn we\u2019re standing in was completed, and she sat me back here, and had my leg fixed up some. I can walk, now- though it still isn\u2019t quite easy, and now I get to sit behind this desk, on my little stool, and chat up beauties like yourself all day!\u201dHe aims a playfully joking nudge in her direction, laughing heartily before continuing with his story.\u201cIt\u2019s easy work, though. Sometimes I need to get up and see to matters in the inn, but it\u2019s really just desk work. Like I said, the pay is good, and the benefits are excellent. \u2018Get to eat at the best place in town for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and I have a room just upstairs. Don\u2019t have to walk very far at all, very accommodating. I love my job, and would very much recommend you attempt to find one with Madame Naoki.\u201d\u201cOnce she gets back, that is. See- \u2018parrently running The Sun here wasn\u2019t quite enough, she\u2019s also a high-profile member of the Isranian government now, functioning both as the Treasurer- in charge of the entire nation\u2019s finances, and also as Ambassador-at-Large to some grabbag of nations to the north.\u201dHe shakes his head slightly, as if disapproving. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how she manages it all. But the fact of the matter is, she\u2019s out on diplomatic business across the sea, and can\u2019t see anyone in the meantime.\u201d\u201cYou should stick around, though. Not only would I continue to appreciate your business and your presence, I think it would be well worth your time to wait, or at least come back later.\u201dWith this advice given, Cecil moves as if to lean back on his stool, before remembering that it\u2019s a stool, and righting himself. Hmph. As excellent as his little stool is, perhaps he would have to have a little easychair brought in instead.

She ran The Sun, she was the Treasurer and an Ambassador. Quite the workload.\"Oh, I will definitely stick around. This place is amazing and if even half of what you just said is true, then this sounds like the perfect place for me. Do you know when she's coming back?

Yet, he had another reason for coming to this fine establishment.  The old smith was not fond of carrying around the large sums of money necessary to make his acquisitions.  Instead he possessed a much rarer, smaller, and more expensive treasure: <i>dragon dust</i>, one of the finest alchemical drugs. It was made with finely ground dragon bone mixed with Imud's personal concoction.  As the fine power was mixed a complicated enchantment was cast upon it by the fire daemon that worked Imud's forge.<br><br/>Only a small amount of dragon dust would clear the mind while giving it a sense of euphoria.  It sharpened the senses and gave increased strength. Some even said that it was possible to survive on dragon dust alone, but doing such a thing would be far too expensive. The down sides were that the effects only lasted about half an hour and it was easy to overdose. Users had also been known to kill themselves recklessly while thinking themselves completely invincible. The drug itself was not addicting the accomplishments that some gained through its use were.<br/><br/>Needless to say, the Midnight Sun was one of the only places where such a thing could be sold in quantity at a fair price.  So Imud assumed. \u00a0He left his horse and carriage with a stable boy and made his way to the exchange booth. \"My name is Imud and I bring a princely gift to trade with you.\" A tan a shriveled old hand pulled an ornate ivory box laced with gold. \u00a0He set in on the counter in front of the clerk and opened the lid. \u00a0<br/><br/>\"Dragon dust. Imud would take money, but it would be easier on this old man if you could open an account. \u00a0I expect there will be many things I'll be purchasing in this city.\"<div></div><div class=\"quote_clear\"></div></br></div></div>"}, "post-31983": {"user": "Leona Malric", "user_num": 1267, "timestamp": "1460049670000", "message": "\"Oh she is?\" Leona asked. \"Well then, I guess I better hurry.\" she said and pushed herself off the desk.\"Wish me luck!\" she said going through the doors into the main room.

I'm not sure where to start.\" she said and thought about it. She also wasn't sure what to tell her and what not. Should she tell her, that she part of a tribe, who give their children in the custody of dragons? That she was raised and trained by one? That this dragon just vanished one day and she has been searching for him ever since?\"Hmmmm. Well, I was born far south from here in a land similar to this, but it's much hotter and we got a lot more sand than dirt. I am a member of a tribe, who live their lives among dragons. They exist in symbiosis with each other. Of course there are small disputes sometimes, but we don't kill each other or anything. Anyway, from time to time specially picked infants are chosen to be raised by one of these dragons and there they learn exceptional skills and receive remarkable equipment. They never get told, who their real parents are. But most of the times, they don't even want to know, because they have their dragon as a parent.\" she explained. Although it was probably clear, that she was one of those children, she couldn't bring herself to say it.\"Well ...\" she said after a short pause, where she was lost in memories, \"and I've been travelling around for almost 8 years now. I earned money from all different kinds of jobs to stay alive.

I\u2019m obviously not going to be around to handle their entrance tomorrow, so unless a higher authority tells you otherwise or assumes the responsibility themselves, you should consider yourself as in charge of handling this event.

I\u2019ll send some workers over with the paperwork, and give them instructions to follow your direction. Don\u2019t bother forcing each refugee to file their papers tomorrow; they\u2019re going to be tired, and it\u2019s unreasonable to expect them all to fill out a bunch of paperwork before coming through the gates, but make sure that they know that will have to at some point, and try to make the paperwork accessible somewhere in the event that some of them would like to do it immediately.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s also the non-insignificant matter of where to put all of these refugees.

Their military is comprised primarily of what Lord Seryl believes to be indoctrinated and/or brainwashed soldiers. This is both a good and a bad thing.

Even if he does seem to be handling things well on the surface, I would bet you a substantial sum that the emotional turmoil he- and the rest of the refugees- are going through is intense.

Excellent, that was surprisingly simple. All I\u2019m really looking for is information I don\u2019t have about world events. There\u2019s not really a good way to know what\u2019s happening over in say, Gauldin, besides having someone who is there- or has been there, tell you. In Gauldin specifically, I have a sufficient number of informers and allies, but as far as the rest of the world is concerned, I\u2019m essentially blind, save for what rumors drift about downstairs. I\u2019d like information relating to essentially all aspects of other nations and regions, and their inhabitants. Information about the goings-on in their governments, rumors that circulate, noteworthy locations or events that you happen across, whatever you can find.\u201d\u201cSo! Here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. You\u2019re going to make for me a list of everything that you need to travel the world. I intend to outfit you to the best of my ability up front, because I can afford to. Are your boots old? I\u2019ll buy you new ones, that sort of thing. Whatever supplies you might need that would be pertinent, make a list, and I\u2019ll have them provided. I\u2019m also going to give you an assortment of magical communication devices and scrying foci, and you\u2019ll carry those with you. Then, whenever you\u2019re prepared to depart, you will do so, and head to some far off part of the world that I haven\u2019t got enough information about. Once you\u2019re there, you\u2019re going to use the equipment I\u2019ve given you to make regular reports back here, and tell us all about it. If there\u2019s something that I\u2019d like examined in more detail or investigated further, you\u2019ll make a reasonable effort to do so, but not at risk to yourself.\u201d\u201cEvery month, I\u2019ll send a messenger out to you with a supply of goods that are valuable in the land you\u2019re currently in. That\u2019ll probably mean gold, in more cases than not. Enough to support your travel-related expenses and some more on top of that as your salary. I\u2019ll send that, and replacements for any supplies that you might need replaced. New boots if you wear yours out, or what-have-you.\u201d\u201cFor as long as you continue to supply information I don\u2019t have, I will continue to supply you. Whatever you choose to do with your time beyond gathering and reporting information is yours to spend as you wish, just as so long as it doesn\u2019t get in the way of your job for me. If all of that sounds agreeable to you, there should be some forms and writing supplies in the cabinet to your right. You\u2019ll need to fill out your portions of those, so if you'd be so kind as to bring one of each over here, I'll guide you through filling them out. Though you don\u2019t necessarily need to file for Isranian citizenship- since you're not going to be in the country, I would suggest doing so anyway because that makes doing my taxes simpler.\u201d", "link_list": ["/post/32854/thread", "/user/1105", "/post/32630/thread", "/user/607"], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/oFQsr0B.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/jxxfhPa.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@whir\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/32854/thread\" timestamp=\"1460429423\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-1105\" title=\"Whir\"><img alt=\"Whir Avatar\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/oFQsr0B.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/32854/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1460429423000\" title=\"Apr 11, 2016 18:50:23 GMT -8\">Apr 11, 2016 18:50:23 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-1105 group-0\" href=\"/user/1105\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@whir\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Whir</span></a></span> said:</div><div author=\"@madamenaoki\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/32630/thread\" timestamp=\"1460334021\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-607\" title=\"Empress Naoki\"><img alt=\"Empress Naoki Avatar\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/jxxfhPa.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/32630/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1460334021000\" title=\"Apr 10, 2016 16:20:21 GMT -8\">Apr 10, 2016 16:20:21 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-607 group-0\" href=\"/user/607\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@madamenaoki\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Empress Naoki</span></a></span> said:</div>Madame Naoki doesn't seem fazed by Whir's introduction.

But he was too busy. Remembering, that there was someone at her door, she went to open it and saw a tall... drow? She tried to meet her eyes and was surprised that she couldn't see any. Instead the darkelf was wearing a black leather blindfold. She felt a little uncomfortable, because she didn't know where to focus her gaze on.

After some minor fumbling to locate the doorknob, she twisted it and pulled it open, then stepped out into the hallway. As she made her way toward her office, she tapped into the TMS communications network via her ring, contacting Cyronin the Blue telepathically.Mister Cyronin, this is Takhana Veil. We haven't had the opportunity to meet properly, and I'm afraid this isn't the time for that. I've alerted your partner of the mission at hand and informed her to meet you posthaste; she seems a reasonable sort and will likely be out shortly. Her name is Leona Malric. Once you two are en route, please let me know, so that I can brief you on the specifics of the specialized gear you'll be using once you reach your destination. Reaching her office, she unlocked the door and opened it, moving inside. After locking the door behind her, she settled in her desk chair, then reached out to another set of operatives, Alden Marshal and Lorelei & Lucia.Alden, Lorelei, and Lucia. You will be departing on a mission tomorrow. Please come by my office tomorrow morning at your earliest convenience to receive your mission briefing and to meet the fourth member of your team.

You seem to quite the level-headed and competent individual, so I\u2019m fairly confident I\u2019ll be able to offer you a position you\u2019ll find suitable. To do that, I would like to ask you about yourself.

The seemingly solid orb seems to fill with a purplish-blue sort of mist, somewhat reminiscent of a brilliant night sky. Within the mists, shapes bend and distort, before coalescing into an image of the back of someone\u2019s head. Someone with straight, reddish brown hair, and ears that seem to have been stolen from a cat, even. <br><br/>Facing directly away from Indil\u2019s seat, Naoki\u2019s image looks side to side, but sees no one in the chair before her. Yet, must be someone in the room. Figuring to turn all the way around, Naoki\u2019s disembodied head catches sight of Indil, sitting there as she is. Naoki takes a brief moment to study appreciate the guest\u2019s features before speaking up. Evidently some variety of Elf, and not a bad looking one, at that. Though, Naoki supposes, she hasn\u2019t ever quite seen a <i>bad </i>looking elf, persay.<br/><br/>\u201c<i><sup>He-hem.</sup></i>\u201d Naoki clears her throat in an an attempt to get the visitor\u2019s attention before beginning to speak, \u201cHello, Ms; I am Madame Naoki, and you\u2019re presumably here to speak with me. To whom do I owe the pleasure, and what is it that you would like to speak about?\u201d<br/><br/><br/><div class=\"quote_clear\"></div></br></div></div>Indil looked down towards the sudden voice, surprised to see the face in the orb but not showing it. She then sat with perfect posture and faced the orb directly, dark eyes quickly examining the other woman's visage as she spoke. Indil inclined her head in polite greeting before responding to the pleasant introduction. Given the orb's probable field of vision, all Madame Naoki would likely be able to see would be Indil's own sharp features and the quiverfull of blue-fletched arrows rising beyond the Elf's shoulder.<br/><br/>\"Hail, Madame. I am Indil Elendrili, a Ranger but newly arrived in the Free City after long travel. Cecil, the Innkeeper downstairs, recommended you as a well-informed individual regarding city affairs. As I have not yet found employment within the city, I felt that I should make myself known to you and offer my services.\"<br/><br/>Her voice was a soft alto, nearly accented but such a one that is easily placed. As Indil preferred to keep her speech concise, she ended her comment with another nod and awaited Madame Naoki's response.<br/><br/><div class=\"quote_clear\"></div></div></div>"}, "post-32999": {"user": "Cyronin the Blue", "user_num": 807, "timestamp": "1460523609000", "message": "Very well, Ms. Veil.

After some minor fumbling to locate the doorknob, she twisted it and pulled it open, then stepped out into the hallway. As she made her way toward her office, she tapped into the TMS communications network via her ring, contacting Cyronin the Blue  telepathically.Mister Cyronin, this is Takhana Veil. We haven't had the opportunity to meet properly, and I'm afraid this isn't the time for that. I've alerted your partner of the mission at hand and informed her to meet you posthaste; she seems a reasonable sort and will likely be out shortly. Her name is Leona Malric. Once you two are en route, please let me know, so that I can brief you on the specifics of the specialized gear you'll be using once you reach your destination. Reaching her office, she unlocked the door and opened it, moving inside. After locking the door behind her, she settled in her desk chair, then reached out to another set of operatives, Alden Marshal  and Lorelei & Lucia .Alden, Lorelei, and Lucia. You will be departing on a mission tomorrow. Please come by my office tomorrow morning at your earliest convenience to receive your mission briefing and to meet the fourth member of your team. With that done, she took a moment to slump in her chair and simply relax. She was going to have a busy day tomorrow.\"Oh, there is?\" she asked curiously. She had not expected, that this simple thing could change so much. What, was that job about crawling through a spider's hole? Well...\"Ehm. Sure thing.\" she said a little bit confused. That was all she wanted to know? And wasn't that too big of a coincidence? She came in here, hours before her deparment, asking about her fears. And that one thing Leona could think of, would have such an impact, that she had to switch jobs? Not that it bothered her. It was just a thought.She raised and watched Takhana leave her room. Cyronin the Blue was already waiting for her? Oh, heavens. She then gathered all of her belongings as quickly as possible. Akanor sat up and watched her. He felt that something was going to happen soon.\"Hey, guess what?\" Leona asked Akanor. \"We're going on a mission.\" she said in the slightly higher pitched voice, which she used to talk with him. He understood and started to yelp and jump around from excitement. Leona finished packing her stuff and donned her leather and dragonscale armor. Longsword and backpack on her back, daggers on her belt, knives on her pauldron. She was all set and ready.Leaving the room and locking it behind her, she wondered what room she would get, when she returned. She went downstairs and handed Cecil the key. \"Wish me luck, Cecil, I'm going on my first mission. Better take a good look at my butt, because you won't have the chance to do that for a looooooooong time.\" she said with an evil grin. She then confidently left the inn and The Midnight Sun.Outside she looked around for someone who could be this Cyronin the Blue. She saw a man sitting on a horse, with another one at his side. That had to be him. She approached and asked him.\"Excuse me, do you happen to be Cyronin the Blue?

I can conduct myself with deportment and sing and play some instruments.\" It was at once both obvious and impossible to imagine the stoic Elf dressed and performing like a fine lady. Clearly, however, they were not skills she utilized often.\"What sort of work you might use me for depends on what you require.\" she said with another light shrug. \"If you can use one such as me I would be honored for it.\"", "link_list": ["/post/32996/thread", "/user/607"], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/jxxfhPa.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@madamenaoki\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/32996/thread\" timestamp=\"1460521834\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-607\" title=\"Empress Naoki\"><img alt=\"Empress Naoki Avatar\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/jxxfhPa.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/32996/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1460521834000\" title=\"Apr 12, 2016 20:30:34 GMT -8\">Apr 12, 2016 20:30:34 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-607 group-0\" href=\"/user/607\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@madamenaoki\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Empress Naoki</span></a></span> said:</div>\u201cPleased to meet you, Ms. Elendrili.

He understood and started to yelp and jump around from excitement. Leona finished packing her stuff and donned her leather and dragonscale armor. Longsword and backpack on her back, daggers on her belt, knives on her pauldron. She was all set and ready.<br/><br/>Leaving the room and locking it behind her, she wondered what room she would get, when she returned. She went downstairs and handed Cecil the key. \"Wish me luck, Cecil, I'm going on my first mission.

His sword was strapped into his bedroll at the side of the horse, and he assumed Leona would do the same.

Excellent, that was surprisingly simple. All I\u2019m really looking for is information I don\u2019t have about world events. There\u2019s not really a good way to know what\u2019s happening over in say, Gauldin, besides having someone who is there- or has been there, tell you. In Gauldin specifically, I have a sufficient number of informers and allies, but as far as the rest of the world is concerned, I\u2019m essentially blind, save for what rumors drift about downstairs. I\u2019d like information relating to essentially all aspects of other nations and regions, and their inhabitants. Information about the goings-on in their governments, rumors that circulate, noteworthy locations or events that you happen across, whatever you can find.\u201d<br><br/>\u201cSo! Here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. You\u2019re going to make for me a list of everything that you need to travel the world. I intend to outfit you to the best of my ability up front, because I can afford to. Are your boots old? I\u2019ll buy you new ones, that sort of thing. Whatever supplies you might need that would be pertinent, make a list, and I\u2019ll have them provided. I\u2019m also going to give you an assortment of magical communication devices and scrying foci, and you\u2019ll carry those with you. Then, whenever you\u2019re prepared to depart, you will do so, and head to some far off part of the world that I haven\u2019t got enough information about. Once you\u2019re there, you\u2019re going to use the equipment I\u2019ve given you to make regular reports back here, and tell us all about it. If there\u2019s something that I\u2019d like examined in more detail or investigated further, you\u2019ll make a reasonable effort to do so, but not at risk to yourself.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cEvery month, I\u2019ll send a messenger out to you with a supply of goods that are valuable in the land you\u2019re currently in. That\u2019ll probably mean gold, in more cases than not. Enough to support your travel-related expenses and some more on top of that as your salary. I\u2019ll send that, and replacements for any supplies that you might need replaced. New boots if you wear yours out, or what-have-you.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cFor as long as you continue to supply information I don\u2019t have, I will continue to supply you. Whatever you choose to do with your time beyond gathering and reporting information is yours to spend as you wish, just as so long as it doesn\u2019t get in the way of your job for me. If all of that sounds agreeable to you, there should be some forms and writing supplies in the cabinet to your right. You\u2019ll need to fill out your portions of those, so if you'd be so kind as to bring one of each over here, I'll guide you through filling them out. Though you don\u2019t necessarily <i>need </i>to file for Isranian citizenship- since you're not going to be in the country, I would suggest doing so anyway because that makes doing my taxes simpler.\u201d<br/><br/><div class=\"quote_clear\"></div></br></div></div>\u00a0 \u00a0Whir hadn't been under another's regulation since he left his father's estate.

After all, employment couldn't be expected unless she had some valuable skills.\u00a0\"Indeed, Madame Naoki, it is a pleasure to make your acquaintance. I am, as I mentioned, a Ranger. I can track and hunt, have no difficulties with long treks, and I am skilled with the bow. I also have some understanding of wild flora, as well as small magics to aid in the hunt.\" She gave a light shrug. She disliked discussing herself and so did so with expediency more than false modesty. She was stating her skills. Demonstration of her mastery of them would come when put to her use.\"Though I believe my professional skills are what you would require most, honesty requires me to add that I also have genteel talents as well. I can conduct myself with deportment and sing and play some instruments.\" It was at once both obvious and impossible to imagine the stoic Elf dressed and performing like a fine lady. Clearly, however, they were not skills she utilized often.\"What sort of work you might use me for depends on what you require.\" she said with another light shrug. \"If you can use one such as me I would be honored for it.\"The image of Madame Naoki within the orb continues to nod slowly as Indil speaks to her capabilities. The faint tracings of a smile play at the corners of her mouth.\u201cYou know, Ms. Elendrili, you make a good impression. I can\u2019t quite articulate why, but you seem very capable. I like you, and will gladly accept your services. To start with, I have one task in mind that should make use of your skills as a Ranger, but after that, let\u2019s reevaluate things and perhaps place you into another position; I\u2019m in need of individuals who can fulfill leadership roles.\u201d\u201cTo formalize your employment, I\u2019m going to have to ask that you fill out some paperwork, and file for Isranian citizenship. All of the relevant documents should be in the cabinet to your right, if you\u2019d be so kind as to retrieve one of each, along with some writing tools, I\u2019ll guide you through filling them out. After those forms are completed, I\u2019d like you to head up to the third floor, to the second door on the right. That is the office of my associate Takhana Veil  ; she will guide you through the rest of the initiation process and give you your first assignment.\u201d The Elf crooked her lips in a wry smile. It was not the first time she had been earmarked for a leadership role. \"I'm pleased that my qualifications are to your satisfaction, Madame Naoki. You too, seem very capable and indeed I will be honored to have you as my employer.\" In Indil's estimation, the other woman's competence was obvious. Though she had initiated this meeting, Indil would not have accepted employment from someone she did not deem of good character.\u00a0With that said, the Ranger rose from her seat and moved to the mentioned cabinet and pulled down the required documents. Writing in an elegantly slanted script, she filled out the forms as Madame Naoki directed. After finally signing her name as it was written in the Elven script, Indil set down her pen and looked over the paperwork. She was now to be a citizen of Isra, rather than...not.

Once she managed to move her thin frame inside she shut the door behind her and let her awestruck gaze sweep over the place - the bar dotted with buyers and glasses, tables seating small group partaking in meals... food.

Now that there was a duty to perform, her sharp features had assumed their professional mask, and her dark gaze swept over the twins without displaying her surprise at their appearance. Since all other indications were that Madame Naoki and her employees would not risk innocent lives, there must be more to these twins than met the eyes. She glanced at Alden and found him to be far more like what she was expecting, approving of his competent appearance. When Takhana began speaking, the Elf returned her attention to her.After Takhana posed her question, Indil thought a moment before waiting for anyone else to speak. In the silence, she would have given a light shrug and said \"I can't think of anything additional, then. We know there will be a guard to dispose of but not what sort and we know that the gems should be loose. That generally answers my earlier thoughts.\" Indil considered the signs Takhana had given of the monster's presence. Many things preyed on people and wildlife, and she wondered if it was something she had hunted before.At the knock, Indil would have turned an accepted the package with an inclined head to both the porter and then Takhana.", "link_list": ["/post/33600/thread", "/user/1067"], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/6QF1T6B.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@takhana\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/33600/thread\" timestamp=\"1460916674\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-1067\" title=\"Takhana Veil\"><img alt=\"Takhana Veil Avatar\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/6QF1T6B.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/33600/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1460916674000\" title=\"Apr 17, 2016 10:11:14 GMT -8\">Apr 17, 2016 10:11:14 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-1067 group-0\" href=\"/user/1067\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@takhana\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Takhana Veil</span></a></span> said:</div><font face=\"times\">When the twins entered, followed swiftly by Indil and Alden, a wide smile creased the half-Drow's face. <font color=\"725296\">\"Ah, excellent.

I'm looking into the possibility of griffin operations over open water- the ocean. Stationing griffins semi-permanently on seafaring or airborne vessels, as opposed to the land-based... bases you use today.\u00a0The unparalleled mobility and tactical versatility offered by skilled griffin riders such as yourself, in the context of what is usually simply ship-to-ship conflict would be an immense asset to have, if I can make it logistically viable to do so, even if only for temporary periods.\"\"With that in mind, let me ask this question. Can griffins fish, or swim? I mean, I would assume not, but your experiences with griffins far outpace my knowledge. Further, if griffins were provided with fish, would they eat it? Is salt-water fish an acceptable substitute for beef, do you think? If you're unsure, that's perfectly fine, don't feel obligated to give me an answer if you're not confident it's fully correct.\"", "link_list": ["/post/34721/thread", "/user/1337", "/post/34692/thread", "/user/607"], "image_list": ["https://imgur.com/dQA6A3R.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/jxxfhPa.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@dutchmetal\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/34721/thread\" timestamp=\"1461531571\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-1337\" title=\"Elizabeth Finch\"><img alt=\"Elizabeth Finch Avatar\" src=\"https://imgur.com/dQA6A3R.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/34721/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1461531571000\" title=\"Apr 24, 2016 12:59:31 GMT -8\">Apr 24, 2016 12:59:31 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-1337 group-0\" href=\"/user/1337\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@dutchmetal\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Elizabeth Finch</span></a></span> said:</div><div author=\"@madamenaoki\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/34692/thread\" timestamp=\"1461515688\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-607\" title=\"Empress Naoki\"><img alt=\"Empress Naoki Avatar\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/jxxfhPa.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/34692/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1461515688000\" title=\"Apr 24, 2016 8:34:48 GMT -8\">Apr 24, 2016 8:34:48 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-607 group-0\" href=\"/user/607\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@madamenaoki\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Empress Naoki</span></a></span> said:</div>\u201cI\u2019m considering exploring new territory in the\u2026\u201d She pauses, mulling over her choice in words. \u201cIn the long range deployment of griffins, among other things.

In low supply, hostile situations they will even eat the enemy dead. Several of them are even partial to fish. I have never seen a griffin fish, but I am certain you could teach them to fish in a manner similar to eagles. They are large enough that few things in the water would pose a threat, probably only large sharks. I wouldnt station more than a squad or so on a ship though.

Though she moves with the same curtness and elegance of movement as is standard, the faraway glaze on her eyes and the way her grip on the doorknob trembles attests to the freshly imparted weight on her shoulders; the weight of a nation. Almost mechanical footsteps take Naoki up, from the first floor to the second, and from the second to the third. At last, her walk from The Citadel back to her office is complete, and she collapses into her adjective chair, trusting Artemis to close the door behind them. For a few long moments, she simply sits, chin in hand, eyes focused on the left wall, and upon the map of Isra that adorns it. Over the course of the next week or so, responsibility for this entire city, this entire nation, will come to rest quite squarely on her shoulders. Not quite her shoulders alone, she supposes. There is Tyrus. Much of the administrative work will be his responsibility, especially the majority of the most boorish and mundane maintenance tasks. However, that leaves to her the most important decisions- the incumbency to act decisively, in the best manner in the interest of the people of Isra, as Lady of The Free City. It is at once both an empowering and terrifying prospect to consider. In the election of the last few hours, she was chosen to become arguably one of the highest authorities in the known world.

Her word will be law in Isra; quite literally, as opposed to the de-facto ways of yesterday. Decisions of international policy and appointment of government officials will be hers to make. As the seconds tick past and the metaphorical gears of her mind continue to turn, responsibility after responsibility becomes apparent, and the list of changes to be made and tasks to accomplishes grows longer and longer, to speak nothing of her higher obligation to Kate, and the juggling act that will become necessary to balance all of these matters- public and private, now all with the highest levels of importance. To think! Ildesias is in his three-hundreds, with thirty times the amount of life experiences and leadership practice under his belt, and yet this job broke him. As the pangs of regret begin to sink in, his words echo through her mind.. Apr 29, 2016 9:43:51 GMT -8 Ildesias Xen Torsal said:\"Congratulations on your appointment, Madame. I trust you will find that I did not leave you with a room of unfinished paperwork; which is exactly why I retired. Being able to sleep once again at night will be... Nice, though I fear I will never be rid of the smell of parchment. Do not worry though, as I believe you will be different in the way you approach these things. I admit, I have never had time for personal relationships, or friends, or people I can count on - for many years now I have been acting alone in nearly all things, for I never truly felt I had a trustworthy individual to turn to ask for aid. Thus, I took a burden on my shoulders far too heavy for most - a burden I expect you will not have to take yourself. You seem to have many such individuals in your business and personal life, many such relationships to call on. I expect you will be able to delegate much better than I.\"Unfolding and leaning back, she shifts her gaze first to Artemis, as she stands- locking the door, and then up to the ceiling. Ildesias made a good point, though she didn\u2019t realize the fullness of it at the time. Already, ideas surface regarding which of her associates would be best suited for positions of power in the government, and she admittedly does have a solid handful of trustworthy individuals in the government already, in Elizabeth Finch   and Cyronin the Blue  , and plenty more, such as Jun of the Celadine   and Takhana Veil ,  just to name two, who would doubtless be of unparalleled assistance, no matter their post, and to say nothing of Artemis  .Hands folded in her lap, a deep and rolling sigh passes Naoki\u2019s lips. A new chapter in her life, she supposes. Wrought with an entirely new set of challenges and problems to solve. This time- however, she came prepared. If not fully prepared for the trials, mental, physical, philosophical and ethical that will doubtless face her in the coming years, she is at least somewhat more prepared than she was at the start of the last chapter, with only a single companion and a book. And, regardless, the die has already been cast.

I wasn\u2019t expecting the opportunity- nobody quite expected Ildesias to resign so soon. But then he did, and the opportunity presented itself. In the space of five minutes, I had to choose. If I would sit or stand; if I would run for the position or not. \u2026 And some small part of me, it said \u201cWhy the hell not.\u201d There was the opportunity to continue moving upward in quite possibly the only way I could, staring me in the face. If I didn\u2019t take it, it probably wouldn't have come about again peacefully.\u201d\u201cI wasn\u2019t quite without rational consideration in those few minutes, though. There were a few specious notions of serving the greater good. Improving the world. Doing the right thing. That sort of\u2026 high and mighty \u201cmoral\u201d nonsense. I would be able to- I am able to enact my will on this world, this nation, in a greater capacity than ever before, and in greater capacity than any other being in Isra, and that\u2019s an empowering feeling to have.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not quite sure why I\u2019m so fixated on this concept of my capability to change things, though. It would be easier to justify my actions with some basic, oneliner sin. Greed for wealth or lust for power, envy for those who carry more authority, or any of those similar reasons. All perfectly valid justifications, if one considers the concept of justification itself to be valid.\u201d\u201cIt would also have been easier to simply retire. We could have afforded to retire comfortably two years ago. It would doubtless be far easier and less taxing for the three of us to simply retreat up to the Chalet and live out the rest of our lives with no obligations other than to each other. I\u2019m not sure why exactly I haven\u2019t decided to do that yet, either.\u201d\u201cPerhaps I\u2019ve been spending too much time with Jun and Lum. Perhaps their righteous \"moral code\" has infected me. Maybe I want to improve things for the better simply because it would be the \u2018right\u2019 thing to do. Yet, I still hold a deep seated disagreement for that method of thinking, and that\u2019s not at all how I consider it, even internally. Morals are still a construction of man; I am still an amoralist.\u201d\u201cBut is it not the duty of the state to provide an environment in which individuals can not only live, but live well? Is it not, as she said, the obligation of those who are already happy and able to do so, to be compassionate and assist others in finding their own happiness?\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s really not, not at all. Obligation is a concept that only functions in a legal context. There is nothing truly compelling me to serve Isra other than my own inclination to do so. And that\u2019s the extent of it, I suppose. Though my justifications are specious and ultimately fallacious, I think that I\u2019ve decided that it\u2019s what I\u2019d like to do. For my own selfish reasons of desiring the sort of satisfaction that comes with seeing a job well done, and to see others benefit from my leadership. I have proven- I think, my ability to act in an administrative capacity. I would like to take this step up- to a position of true authority, and utilize my capabilities to enable those who are not happy to become so, and create a truly enviable nation. One that not only protects its citizens and allows them to live in civilised society, but the opportunity to live well, and be satisfied with their lot in life. Not because I think it the \u201cright\u201d thing to do, or because I have any obligations whatsoever, besides those I have chosen to take to a few individuals, but rather because I have chosen to place personal subjective value upon it.\u201dAs the implications of her statement begin to sink in, her contemplative pout gives way to a  small smile, and Naoki begins to chuckle. \u201cI suppose what I said initially was more correct than I realized.

Next, she raises her left hand, displaying her palm to Calico. The silver signet ring bearing the symbol of The Midnight Sun. A constant accessory of hers for the past four years. With the signing of that contract, now essentially unfit for her hand. Technically, she still owns the whole shebang, and would be very well justified in wearing the ring. However, the purpose of the ring is to identify the acting leader. Which is no longer her, as strange as that is to think. After a moment more of wistful contemplation, she slides the ring off and places it in place of the contract before Calico on the table. A light crease is visible on her finger where the ring once sat, which she rubs at absently. Her new ring would have to be made slightly larger, she muses. With that ceremony complete, Madame Naoki stands, and addresses Calico once again. \u201cHowever, for the time being, I must depart. I have a dinner to attend, and there\u2019s apparently a woman bleeding profusely on the carpet downstairs. We\u2019ll be in touch, and I\u2019ll inform you more specifically of your duties over the next short while. Until we speak again.\u201dAfter nodding solemnly, Naoki bends down to pick up her bag sitting on the floor to the side of her desk, and makes for the exit, pausing for a moment to futilely attempt to pat the feathers on the top of Calico\u2019s head back into place. Leaving him to his state of perpetual-ruffledness, she departs with Artemis in tow, leaving the door open behind her. Her paces take her down the stairs, once, twice, down to the primary eating hall, and toward the area near the door where Whir and his injured companion are beginning to gather a crowd. A low \"he-hem\"\u00a0clears a path through the crowd, and Madame Naoki approaches the group gathered near the door. Though she had been expecting to find an injured woman, the severity of her injuries seem to be greater than Naoki was expecting. However, she wastes no time in horrification, instead approaching more closely, and bending down at the knee in a position somewhat near to the unconscious woman\u2019s head. She gives Whir a moment of her attention before looking to assess the injuries. Lots of bleeding, that\u2019s for sure. But none of the gashes seem to have penetrated to anything vital. Superficial wounds are easy to fix, she muses, reaching a hand into the pouch on her hip. Pulling out a pair of rubies, she hands them off to Artemis. Artemis is more adept in the ways of channeling their magic, and in situations such as these where it doesn\u2019t particularly matter, it would be preferable to have her do it. She also gives the troll and the sword clasped so tightly in the woman\u2019s arms a glance, but only a single, passing one each, judging neither to be immediately relevant to the most pressing matter at hand. Figuring it best to leave the woman\u2019s head undisturbed, and seeing the woman\u2019s hands wrapped tightly around the hilt of the sword, Naoki places two of her fingers on the elf\u2019s inner elbow, and attempts to locate a pulse. As she\u2019s counting mentally, she levies inquisitive glances at both Whir and the troll, expecting someone to explain exactly what\u2019s going on here.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\u201cUnfortunately, the only list I have is a mental one.

The troll woman claimed she was from another plane.. had the wizard truly thrown her through time and space itself, to another world, another dimension? How was she able to speak the language? Admittedly some words sounded.. odd, but she was in a distant land... No, she had to admit it to herself. She was so far away from her home that she would never be going back. It didn't matter if the wizard spoke truth and that all her people were dead, her kingdom never to be reclaimed.. if she couldn't get back to her world, what was the point in caring? She was the last Kehl-Nari.<br><br/>Rousing herself from her melancholy, Emahra raised her golden eyes to stare at Whir as he spoke. She said not a word, and made no movements, even as food was offered and the map was spread out across the table.. although she did wince visibly at being called 'princess'. Did she even deserve that title, now? She was the last of a people, the last of a royal line, but she was no longer on a world where any of that meant anything.

Emahra wasn't the type to panic, but she came dangerously close as she inhaled a sharp breath through her nose and clenched her jaw.<br/><br/><font color=\"0000FF\">\"..It would seem Lady Ranijarashi is correct.

A new step in her life.. and this one would be even more geared toward her desire to do good within this city, this nation, which had opened its arms and welcomed her. She turned her focus back to her meal for a few moments, and paused with fork in mouth at Naoki's unexpected compliment to her cooking, and the half-Drow's ears twitched as a faint reddish tinge entered the elongated points of cartilage.<br/><br/><font color=\"725296\">\"Ah.. thank you.

I can make only a few recipes, but I think doing the same ones so many times has made it quite easy to perfect them. Admittedly, having no vision, and the resultant heightened sense of smell, makes it much easier to detect any imbalance of spices, or if the dish in question is nearing the point of burning, and similar such.. things.\"</font> She didn't like speaking about herself, at all.

Mostly back and forth between The Citadel and Chalet. Yet, today, she has a good reason. On her escapade to The Land Tillers\u2019 state, Emahra picked up an interesting sort. An admiral, apparently. One who would like to offer his services to Isra. Which, considering Naoki\u2019s aspirations to cultivate an Isran navy, could potentially be quite useful. Which is, of course, assuming that he\u2019s not some self-declared admiral with zero experience. That would remain to be seen. But today they would be meeting. Emahra, her new admiral friend, and apparently some friends of his. Seeing as how Naoki\u2019s office only has the two seats, she figured that the meeting could be held at The Sun. Because why not.As she weaves her way through the ever-present crowds, some of the older employees recognize her and make their greetings. Naoki nods in response, but doesn\u2019t stop for chatting. Chatting must be scheduled. Eventually, she makes her way up to the second floor, to the private dining room. Due to the potentially secretive nature of the conversations they might have, she figures it best to take it upstairs. Flagging down a pair of employees, Naoki issues her instructions. The table for two is to be exchanged for a larger, six person one. More chairs are brought in, and the bowl-of-fancy-rocks centerpiece is exchanged for an assorted floral arrangement. Can\u2019t go wrong with flowers. Not being quite sure how many guests she\u2019ll be hosting, Naoki has the table set for six. Easier and more polite to have table settings taken away than set out for unexpected guests. Additionally, a bowl of appetizer cheese-bread is placed on the table. Can\u2019t go wrong with appetizer cheese-bread, either. Figuring that her guest ought to be arriving shortly enough, and not having anything much else to do until they arrive, Naoki seats herself at the head of the table, and produces a book from her bag. A relatively new, green leather covered tome, bearing no markings on the exterior. Sliding her plate slightly away, she begins to read, patiently waiting for her company to arrive.

She'd gotten to know the admiral rather well on their trip back from the Expanse, and she quite liked the man; he was polite, well-spoken, intelligent, and with a very sturdy personality that she quite appreciated.. and a sense of humor that she appreciated even more. Not to mention she was quite fond of his little undead friend, despite her general distaste for creatures of that nature. How could she not?

Understandable, it was something every ruler should take into consideration, but what really made the Elf look puzzled was the withdrawal of a box from the cabinet in which she'd been rooting around. And then both of the woman's blue eyebrows shot upward, seemingly trying to escape beneath her circlet and into the hair crowning her head.<br/><br/><font color=\"0000FF\">\"..That was most decidedly not what I expected you to say, my Lady. However, as you well know, I am more than happy to assist you in whatever manner you may require, and will only wait patiently for you to elaborate, when and if you so choose.\"</font> Her pointed ears flicked forward curiously as she straightened and leaned toward the other woman, wondering what this 'chess' she spoke of was. Emahra rolled the word around in her mind before sampling it on her tongue, speaking the word carefully.<br/><br/><font color=\"0000FF\">\"<i>Chess</i>... No, this is not a familiar word to me, I am sorry to say. But there is the chance that it may simply be a game I know by a different name.\"</font> There were, after all, many similarities between this world and that of her origin.. many things were the same, but had different names, she'd learned. Quite strange, indeed.</br></font>"}, "post-42555": {"user": "Empress Naoki", "user_num": 607, "timestamp": "1466988736000", "message": "At Emahra\u2019s admittance of her unfamiliarity, Naoki\u2019s face lights up, evidently somewhat pleased to have the opportunity. \u201cAh, well then, allow me to introduce you!\u201dTurning her gaze to the box, Naoki moves excitedly to unhinge the lid, revealing the contents of the box. It is a chessboard, of a rather audaciously gold and black motif. Carefully removing the board from the box, Naoki sets it on the table between them, and proceeds to unpack the pieces, explaining as she goes. \u201cChess is a game of  strategy and logic played between two individuals using a set, like this one. I received it as a gift from some impudent Gauldish noble who thought he could buy my hand in marriage. He was\u2026 informed otherwise, but I kept the gifts. Turns alternate between the players, and on their turn, each player may choose to move one of their pieces- one set of which, in this case, is the gold, and the other is black. For conversation\u2019s sake, allow me to take the black pieces, and you the gold.\u201d\u201cEach piece- you can see how they\u2019re not all the same, can only move in certain ways across the board. Some are more capable than others. To start with, we have the pawn. Though- I should preface, the whole game, names, movement, and style of the pieces, are all styled very directly after warfare. The pawn, for example, represents a spearman. They are only capable of moving forward. One space at a time, or two spaces if it is the first time that pawn is moving. However, if there is an opposing piece to the forward diagonal, the pawn can move diagonally to capture the piece, like so\u2026\u201dNaoki demonstrates the motion, toppling a gold pawn with her gold. Over the course of the next short while, she proceeds to explain the rules of chess, how each piece moves, the objective of the game, and speaks for a few minutes as to the nuance of the game, and how to play well, one ought to put themselves in the mind of their opponent, and attempt to engineer situations that seem appealing to them, but ultimately result in a favorable trade for you. What she says is mostly correct, and touches upon some rather complex theory, but lacks all personal experience, and comes off more as a scholar reading a dissertation than a master explaining their craft. \u201cAnd\u2026 I must admit. For as much as I know of the game, I\u2019m not a particularly excellent player. I mean to say, understand the game, but\u2026\u201d Naoki shrugs noncommittally. The truth of the matter is that she has never fully applied herself to the game. The extent of her experiences go no farther than a few casual games with Artemis shortly following the acquisition of this jeweled set, (of which she lost all) and a book written about the game, which was read some nine years previously but is remembered as clearly as anything else.\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad way to spend some time with someone, though. And you seem like the sort who might enjoy this manner of game. So, unless you\u2019d prefer not to or have any questions- I may very well have forgotten something important, gold moves first.\u201dResting her elbow on the table and cupping her chin in the palm of her hand, Naoki gestures toward the board, which is now fully prepared, set for their game.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/gnCsMnQ.jpg"], "html": "At Emahra\u2019s admittance of her unfamiliarity, Naoki\u2019s face lights up, evidently somewhat pleased to have the opportunity.

Naoki had greater experience with the game, and Emahra was a good strategist - they were about evenly matched, in that regard. But when Naoki mentioned that she had apparently decided that Emahra herself should be the next High Lady of Isra should Naoki fall, the Elf stiffened, and her metallic eyes shot up to rest upon the other woman's face, her expression one of shock. Certainly, she'd been born a princess, destined to become queen, but this.. was not Kehl-Nari. Her birth meant nothing here. Her upbringing, however, apparently meant a good deal.The notion that she would be given a great deal of authority to act on Naoki's behalf was surprising, a fact mirrored in the upward motion of azure eyebrows and the flick of pointed ears.

Her gaze fixated somewhere beyond those steepled hands as her brain systematically absorbed, sorted, and filed the information that had been given to it. This was her Thinking Pose, and she would remain in it until she was satisfied that she fully comprehended the situation, her part in it, and the consequences of choosing to accept this offer.

You gave me a home and a purpose, and I am forever in your debt.\"</font> This was said plainly, and she clearly believed this statement with all of her being. Her gaze was again focused on the board, watching as moves were exchanged back and forth between the two of them. Naoki had greater experience with the game, and Emahra was a good strategist - they were about evenly matched, in that regard. But when Naoki mentioned that she had apparently decided that Emahra herself should be the next High Lady of Isra should Naoki fall, the Elf stiffened, and her metallic eyes shot up to rest upon the other woman's face, her expression one of shock. Certainly, she'd been born a princess, destined to become queen, but this.. was not Kehl-Nari. Her birth meant nothing here. Her upbringing, however, apparently meant a good deal.<br><br/>The notion that she would be given a great deal of authority to act on Naoki's behalf was surprising, a fact mirrored in the upward motion of azure eyebrows and the flick of pointed ears. After Naoki fell silent, Emahra leaned back away from the table and assumed a pose that the other woman was, if not already familiar with, then likely to become so: With elbows resting on the arms of her chair, she placed her hands before her face with the pads of her fingers pressed together and the digits themselves curved slightly inward toward each other, the very tips of her thumbs resting lightly against her lips. Her gaze fixated somewhere beyond those steepled hands as her brain systematically absorbed, sorted, and filed the information that had been given to it. This was her <i>Thinking Pose</i>, and she would remain in it until she was satisfied that she fully comprehended the situation, her part in it, and the consequences of choosing to accept this offer. She could admit.. it was very logical, on all fronts. Finally, after several long minutes of not moving, she let her hands fall and sat forward again, reaching out to move another piece as she replied, weighing her words carefully even as she spoke them.<br/><br/><font color=\"0000FF\">\"I cannot refute the logic of your proposal. You have clearly considered this from all angles. My only true concern would be the people not accepting me, but I have a suspicion that that would either not occur at all, or would be only a fleeting difficulty. That being said, if you believe I would be the best person for the position - and I do not simply mean serving as your official proxy, but also as your.. replacement, as distasteful as that word is, in the event such an unfortunate necessity were to arise - then I will not attempt to dissuade you. As I said, I am in your debt.. but that is not why I am accepting.

Their contents are as follows, in numerical order. On the backside of the card labeled as \u201c1\u201d there is a drawing. It depicts a being- a humanoid sort of being. But only very loosely so. Its proportions are very much skewed, but not in any particular direction. For example, the thing\u2019s forehead protrudes out well pasts its jaw, and its right arm is considerably larger than its left. Its head- as misshapen as it is, would appear to be completely bald. Indeed, not a single bit of hair is to be seen anywhere on the creature. The second card, as established, has the drawing of the crystal on it. The card marked \u201c3\u201d has some manner of script on it. It seems to be a mixture of pictorial and ideographic characters, most of them very wide and flowing. Whether it reads left to right, right to left, or in some other manner entirely is hard to say. Hell, it\u2019s hard to say if the symbols are even representative of language at all. Regardless, Card Three has a bunch of squiggly stuff on the back. The fourth card is apparently blank on the other side. The fifth card, when turned over, reveals a peculiar sort of symbol, and nothing else. On the backside of the card marked with \u201c6\u201d, is the following text. I don't have eyes, but once I did see. Once I had thoughts, but now I'm white and empty.The seventh card is being difficult, and is apparently unwilling come up off the table. Perhaps it\u2019s glued. Finally, the eighth card, much like the second and first, has a drawing. This drawing is a peculiar sort of one. The easiest portion to identify is the jar. It would simply appear to be a jar, made of glass, transparent, and capped with a wide cork. However, the item within the jar is the peculiar bit. It hovers within the jar- very small. Assuming that the jar itself is about as large as a jar usually is, the item within is about as large as the last digit of one\u2019s thumb. The thing about it, though, is that it seems to move.Which is strange. Considering that it\u2019s ink, and it ought not to be able to move. The most comparable representation as to what it is, however, might be a knot. Or perhaps a pile of snakes, all writhing and slithering around each other with no discernible end or beginning.

Then, her food devoured, she went for the rest of the avalon. If it was tasty, she had no hesitation in gulping down the whole thing.Lamina would find her drink- a pint of Avalon, to be quite tasty indeed. The taste of it is strange- difficult to describe. The most apt comparison may be to liquid gold rolling down one\u2019s throat, though not quite as thick, and chilled as opposed to molten. The aftertaste is somewhat metallic, and tasting of lavender. After the glass is drained, a few moments pass uneventfully before the beverage\u2019s alchemical effects begin to take their hold on Lamina. It is subtle at first, but soon enough, Lamina may begin to notice some of The Sun\u2019s other patrons glancing in her direction, trying to catch glimpses when they think she isn\u2019t looking. With this increased allure comes a subtle change in mindset; Lamina may find herself to be more confident, more prone to holding her shoulders back and head high. Her train of thought may begin to meander in narcissistic directions, and she may find herself to be more concerned than she might otherwise be with her appearance, and what others may think of her. Likewise, other individuals may find themselves drawn to Lamina like flies to a lamp; more receptive of her suggestions, and more eager to please her. However, beyond these charismatic effects, one with an eye for magic may notice that Lamina has an interesting sort of magic about her, surrounding her like a cloud. The magic is strange- not quite like most traditional magics, but rather of an unknown and otherworldly sort. Whether it is this magic that is causing the charismatic increase or the opposite is hard to say, but suffice to say, the Avalon carries quite the kick.

He was equally curious and nauseated by the sweet smells it brought.He didn't mention the sweet smell to Falx. They were intimate friends - it's just that Falx never understood Pez's rodent things. Falx's senses aren't as keen as his, so efforts to explain such things often leave Pez frustrated.The people were loud and . Pez retreated a bit into the bag, a bit scared. Loud noises trigger his reflexes - usually to dart towards the closest hiding spot nearby. Who would they talk to in such a crowd? He looked over their faces. They all looked rather... what's the word? Brutish? It was more unfriendly, if anything. They couldn't just walk up to someone and ask them a question. That's a sure way to get beat up - he'd seen it happen before, back in the town he and Falx once lived in. Pez made himself scarce - he didn't want to attract unwanted attention, once again.

She'd been hard at work on it during her time recovering from her near-death experience, and the craftsmanship showed just how much time and focus she'd poured into the project.Though mildly amused, Naoki does not lean forward to allow Little Alden to grab her ears. That would be weird, and besides the fact that she doesn\u2019t very much enjoy to have her ears manhandled. She does, however, lean forward enough to extend a hand across the table, and puts her index finger within his grasp, such that he might grasp at that  for a short while. In this manner, Naoki listens on as Moonflower continues to speak, expressing surprise and concern as childbirth difficulties are mentioned, but otherwise simply listening. Her next question was to be \u201cWhat\u2019s his name,\u201d but it proves unnecessary.Instead, Naoki offers, \u201cGood, good, on all counts. I had feared worse.\u201dAs Moon goes on to introduce the gift, Naoki raises her eyebrows with the sort of mild and pleasant surprise one expresses when receiving a gift. She had suspected something to that extent, but even so. Glancing down to the box and back across the table, Naoki responds, \u201cThank you. I\u2019m rather curious, so if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m going to have a look\u2026\u201dAssuming no objections are raised, Naoki proceeds to slide over a bit and lift the box from the floor, almost smacking it into her face, surprised by how light it is compared to how it looks like it ought to weigh. But after this initial surprise, she places it onto the table, orienting it such that the latch faces her. It only takes a moment to undo the latch and lift the lid with one hand, which has the side effect of blocking the line of sight between Naoki and Moon. For a moment, there is relative silence. Then, \u201cOh, wow,\u201d is simply stated. There is a wooden sort of movement sound as Naoki removes one of the pawns to hold in her free hand and examine, and after a moment longer, Naoki lowers the lid low enough to peer over it and offer the following, \u201cThis is beautiful. I had intended to visit you in Alban and overpay for a chess set you had already made for sale. I didn\u2019t expect you to take the initiative to create something especially for me - something as exceptional as this - and then travel all the way over here to deliver it in person. I appreciate this, thank you.\u201d With this, Naoki offers a nod of thanks and proceeds to replace the pawn in its respective slot, shut the lid, and fasten the latch. Then, she proceeds to fix Moon with an appraising and somewhat contemplative look, raising one eyebrow and leaning back slightly in her seat.\u201cI must return the favor. Do you find yourself needing, wanting something, anything in particular?\u201d", "link_list": ["/post/58089/thread", "/user/1010", "http://i.imgur.com/rU8Dr2e.jpg"], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/He8JR2z.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@moonflower\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/58089/thread\" timestamp=\"1481486402\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-1010\" title=\"Moonflower L\u00e0idir\"><img alt=\"Moonflower L\u00e0idir Avatar\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/He8JR2z.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/58089/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1481486402000\" title=\"Dec 11, 2016 12:00:02 GMT -8\">Dec 11, 2016 12:00:02 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-1010 group-0\" href=\"/user/1010\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@moonflower\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Moonflower L\u00e0idir</span></a></span> said:</div><font face=\"times\"><font color=\"7184A6\">\"<i>Ah.</i>\"</font> The single syllable response, more sound than actual word, carried a weight of understanding. Moon knew quite well how it was to feel like things were both fantastic and horrible all at once. It was a position she'd been in more than a few times herself, and she gave Naoki a look that was brimming with empathy. She'd not been particularly close with the leader of Isra, but she thought they'd developed something akin to a budding friendship, which was part of what had drawn her to visit the city rather than simply having the gift she'd brought shipped over. A smile spread across her lips as Naoki expanded upon her accomplishments and satisfaction, and she shifted Alden again as he babbled, reaching out chubby hands toward Naoki - specifically, toward her ears.<br><br/><font color=\"7184A6\">\"Ahh, well, I managed to survive the experience, barely. Apparently my body isn't quite made for childbirth and I hemorrhaged and nearly died in the process. But I'm alright now, fully recovered, and little Alden here is happy and healthy. Mihael - my husband - is an amazing father, and his parents are extremely supportive and helpful. Things in Alban are steadily getting better. Relations with the other races are improving, the people are starting to intermingle again, the destroyed portions of the city are being rebuilt. It's pretty fascinating to watch a nation that was on the verge of destroying itself struggling back to stability, and it's.. indescribable to be even a small part of it.\"</font><br/><br/>Balancing her inquisitive son easily in the curve of her arm, his body resting against her chest, she reached out toward the box that was resting nearby and tapped its lid with a fingertip.<br/><br/><font color=\"7184A6\">\"Awkward segue, but fallen nations are somewhat related to why I'm here. My husband's father is originally from Katashima, and he's shown me some drawings of what the place was like, and well.. with a little help from him, I made something for you. I thought it was best delivered in person, which is why I came. Also I thought you might want to meet Alden.\"</font> This was said with a smile as Alden giggled and burbled at the High Lady.

There were quiet growling noises as he chewed on the bread, making his mother chuckle. She tore off a few more pieces of bread and the cheese twined within, spreading out a napkin and laying the pieces within Alden's reach so he could grab them as he liked. She watched him carefully as she continued to eat, making sure he didn't choke on the bites.\"It's sort of strange to be back in Isra. Things here are so different from Alban.

I mean no offense, but if my understanding is accurate, if anything were to happen to your King Averin or that sword of his, the whole nation would sink back into war, and in that situation, I don\u2019t think the human population of Alban fares well.\u201dThe term human is used loosely, of course, but Naoki figures the meaning is clear enough. However, it does lead her to wonder if Little Alden here has inherited any of his mother\u2019s wolven bits. Ask about that later, perhaps.  \u201cI\u2019m not going to see you or your family as one or some of many refugees, so if things start looking at all questionable, get out as quick as you possibly can, come stay up with me, and go back later if it turns out to be safe to do so and you\u2019d like to. Better to come when you might not need to than to be denied the opportunity to come at all.\u201dAs Naoki is speaking, another individual approaches their table. Rather than the server that had delivered the basket of bread or any of his fellows, this individual is rather nondescript, one of many 30-something middle class men who might plausibly be a patron of The Midnight Sun, save for the fact that he wears a white scarf as a sort of sash over one shoulder. He simply approaches, places a small box at the end of the table, turns back about, and leaves, without offering any sort of greeting or even so much as making eye contact.\u201cBeyond that, the place is more than large enough for me to make offers such as that, and I\u2019m sure you would do the same in my place. In any case, this is the second thing, this box here, and the item within\u2026\u201dReaching over with her free hand, Naoki slides the box toward herself. It\u2019s a small - perhaps 3\u201d by 4\u201d by 1\u201d - nondescript wooden sort of thing, not of any particularly exquisite craftsmanship or ornamented in any particular way. It has a simple latch, which Naoki undoes, and then proceeds to open the box. She takes a moment to glance at the contents, assure herself that it\u2019s the right item, before turning the open side of the box to face Moonflower, and sliding it a bit in her direction, but not quite close enough to allow Little Alden to grab it.The item within the box is a vial of clear glass, just large enough to have to be placed into the box at an angle to fit. Within, there seems to be a liquid, a translucent sort of uniform, off-whitish liquid that seems to be undulating a bit and sparking as it does so. The vial is capped with a cork that seems fairly standard, and some brass wiring has been wrapped around the vial in such a way to hold it securely, and a string has been attached to the brass wiring, such that one could wear the whole ensemble as a necklace, or replace the string with something else and keep it secure by some other means.\u201cThis here, this vial, is a potion, a product of alchemy, and a highly advanced one, at that. It doesn\u2019t have a name in the common tongue, only in a dialect of ancient elvish, which I cannot even begin to pronounce. In fact, it was, until perhaps four weeks ago, more or less lost and forgotten knowledge. I went to great lengths to recover the knowledge and then produce some - it took me a few tries. I think the name translates very roughly to \u2018Unicorn Tears\u2019. Not because any unicorns or unicorn products were involved in the creation of it, but presumably because its function is similar to the fabled function of the tears of unicorns: healing of extreme potency.\u201dAs she speaks, Naoki does as she tends to, and gesticulates with her hands to add emphasis and punctuation where appropriate. \u201cIt\u2019s a sort of restorative, see. Not quite like other potions of healing, because it sort of works to restore what was there, instead of what it thinks ought to be there, and the two aren\u2019t necessarily the same. I have a suspicion that it does this by looking into the past in some way, perhaps as a seer might, but I can\u2019t quite be sure. In any case, it\u2019s capable of healing more or less any would or mutilation one might receive, and is effective on a terribly wide range of beings. I\u2019ve not done extensive tests, and the texts certainly aren\u2019t very helpful in this regard, but this batch that I\u2019ve created - of which this is a single vial of - has worked on men and women here in Isra, as well as a Volkrim - a race of primarily bipedal wolf-people, they live up in the Norkari Mountains. Along with healing grievous wounds and alleviating a few sicknesses, the tears here have also apparently worked to reverse the effects of aging to a degree, interestingly enough. Again, I haven\u2019t yet had the opportunity to do any sort of conclusive testing, but a man of sixty who had his hand crushed seemed to become taller, apparently appearing as he did perhaps ten years previously. His hand healed fully as well.\u201d\u201cI would like you to take this vial, keep it safe, hold onto it, explain its function to a few individuals who you can trust, and perhaps use it to save some lives. Only a drop or two into the mouth of whoever you intend to treat should do it. They should, if they can, eat something at the same time, that\u2019ll help. Then, it will do what it does over the course of the next forty-eight hours. I wouldn\u2019t suggest administering any more than that, but I also don\u2019t really know what effects doing so might have.\u201dAt this, Naoki offers a small shrug, intending to further impress that this is very much a new and uncertain thing. Or, an ancient, forgotten and recently rediscovered thing, of which not much of the old knowledge has been recovered.\u201cOne might also be able to utilise the deaging effect to artificially lengthen one\u2019s life, but I also wouldn\u2019t quite recommend that. The substance may have some manner of as of yet unseen side effects if applied multiple times. Can\u2019t be sure. I intend to look into it, and I\u2019ll let you know what I find out, but until then, don\u2019t administer the stuff regularly.\"Glancing away from Moonflower toward Little Alden, Naoki hesitates for the space of a moment before continuing, \"\u2026 I also don\u2019t have any data at all about how it might affect young children, so I would also suggest avoiding administering it to Little Alden unless absolutely necessary until there until he\u2019s got a few years on him.\u201dThough Naoki is fully aware she\u2019s talking her jaw off, she continues, \u201cAnd further, keep in mind that if someone you care about requires medical attention, you absolutely have the option of sending a messenger to Isra, and I would be more than willing to send some of my medical personnel over there, with their professional expertise and whatnot. The same goes for if you need anything else, I owe you a favor and would be more than willing to assist you in whatever manner you might require on account of my holding you in high regard. ... It\u2019s just that\u2026 that I\u2019ve got a whole lot of this stuff, this\u00a0Unicorn Tears substance, that I went to great lengths to research and produce, and now I need to do something with it, so I\u2019m distributing it about in the hope that it will be used in productive ways. To friends, the aforementioned medical personnel, Sun Marshals,\u201d Naoki nods her head in the direction that the man who delivered the box departed in, suggesting that he was a Marshal.\u201c...Officers in Isra\u2019s armed forces, and other individuals who would have a high chance of needing to use it. Save some limbs, some lives. Such is my hope, at least.\u201dAnother small sort of shrug is offered with this, the end of her spiel. As she neared the conclusion, Naoki\u2019s demeanor shifted gradually to become somewhat more subdued, rather somber, but not to the point of being off-putting or hostile.

The serious moment was completely derailed by Little Alden's sudden peal of squealing giggles as Naoki indulged in some raspberry blowing, feet kicking and arms again waving with open exuberance while he grinned toothlessly up at her. Moonflower couldn't help but put a hand over her mouth, trying to stifle her laughter as well as hide the grin there. Especially as his giggles became interspersed with tiny little growls, much like a wolf pup when at play. Clearing her throat as her hand fell, Moon offered a lopsided grin.\"I'm starting to think we're going to have to add Aunt Naoki to the list of people we visit when we come to Isra. He's really taking a shine to... Oh no.\" Moon's amused expression became one of wide-eyed combined embarrassment and discomfort as she saw the expression abruptly twisting Little Alden's face.. as well as the grunting noise that came along with it. Naoki would soon realize that an extremely unpleasant scent was now emanating from the posterior of the child, and Moon tried her hardest not to laugh.\"I um..

Hunching forward, she places an elbow on the table, her chin in her palm, and looks out across the mass of bar goers. It\u2019s strange, she reflects, how so much has changed, but The Midnight Sun remains almost exactly as it was. Same staff, same tables, same patrons, same drinks. Still turning incredible profits. There\u2019s one school of thought, she thinks, that says that this sameness is inherently bad; Calico ought to be attempting to further refine and perfect the system. But then, if it works, why fool with it. She supposes that she has little inclination to take any action regarding the matter, though, there are more pressing matters. On that note, Naoki turns a bit to shift her gaze onto the empty box sitting on the table. The box had contained the potion she had given Ms. Moonflower, the one Naoki has informally dubbed \u2018unicorn tears\u2019. It has properties that work against the natural progression of aging. Considering her previous thoughts on the concept of immortality, Naoki supposes that they\u2019ve changed quite drastically. It would certainly be awful to age at a drastically different scale compared to one who is important to you, or simply not age at all while others do. But then, there isn\u2019t much harm in it if whoever is important to one ages at the same rate, be it accelerated or decelerated... or perhaps even not at all. Considering the matter further, Naoki notes that of the individuals she knows well, there aren\u2019t too many similarities. Various types of humans and elves, demons, vampires, other assorted non-humans, including herself. All with their own speeds. Alden\u2019s children are far more developed than human children their age would be. And there is the line of thinking that says that fooling with the concept of aging would go against the natural order of things. Some just don\u2019t live as long as others, and that is the way of the world. It would be working against nature itself to change such things. Naoki is forced to admit that that line of thinking is entirely correct. But then, the ways of the world have not yet been able to prevent Naoki from accomplishing her goals in spite of them.

He wore no armor or weaponry, just a plain black shirt and loose hide pants. Torrin spotted Lady Naoki and took a seat opposite her, the very top of his tail hanging out past the booth. <br><br/>\"Lady Naoki! A pleasure to see you looking so well on this fine day,\" he said jovially, a wide grin exposing his numerous sharp teeth.<div class=\"quote_clear\"></div></br></div></div>Offering a nod and a smile in greeting, Naoki responds, Likewise, Torrin. I trust you\u2019ve been well since we last met.\u201d<br/><br/>Before she continues, Naoki pauses to ensure that the booth\u2019s runic protections are active and functioning properly. Symbols of ancient magic glow faintly in the otherwise pristine tabletop, guaranteeing, among other things, that none outside the booth will be able to hear the conversation within.<br/><br/>Satisfied, Naoki returns her attention to her guest and spends a moment to look him over. Torrin Delmirev, a seasoned warrior, and experienced leader. She had met him many months previously, through a mutual friend of theirs. He was employed at the time, and Naoki had no particular reason to seek his services, but the two had exchanged pleasantries. They have met by chance on a few occasions since then, and at this point could be considered friendly acquaintances. <br/><br/>\u201cAs I mentioned, I have asked you here to discuss what I intend to develop into a mutually beneficial business relationship. It would involve you becoming employed as the leader of a unique branch of armed forces for The Free States of Isra.\u201d<br/><br/>Naoki pauses to take a sip of her drink before continuing, \u201cWould you like something to eat or drink, or perhaps to discuss anything else before we begin?\u201d<br/><br/>As she awaits a response, her right-hand dips below the table into the pouch on her hip.

Perhaps he means to butter her up beforehand, she thinks. Regardless, as Torrin places the gemstone on the table, Naoki\u2019s eyes widen slightly as she leans in to examine it. \u201cOh, you know me too well\u2026\u201d she says, taking it between two fingers. In holding it up to the light of the chandelier above, Naoki notices the swirling energies within and quirks an eyebrow. These magics are not something she has seen before. They're\u2026 raw, and lacks direction. They are not at all like the carefully woven crystalline spell structures in her gems. She will indeed have her artificer look into this.\u201cThank you,\u201d Naoki continues, returning her attention to her guest. \u201cI appreciate this,\u201d she says, seeming quite sincere. Transferring her pearl from her right hand to her left, Naoki proceeds to place the sapphire in the pouch on her hip.\u201cAs for the food\u2026\u201d Trailing off, Naoki tilts her head slightly to one side, raising one ear directly up as she looks Torrin up and down, presumably to guess toward his taste in food.After a few moments, she offers, \u201cYou may enjoy the 'Black Pepper Beef Fritta'. It is made by taking a sort of egg mix and adding to it things such as the aforementioned pepper and beef, but also cheese, assorted vegetables, perhaps spices. The result is a somewhat\u2026 fluffy, but substantial dish.\u201dWith one finger, she gestures toward the bar and the list of drinks above it. \u201cThose are the drinks offered, but there are far more beneath the counter. The majority of the mixed drinks are strong, in the alchemical sense, as opposed to the strictly alcoholic, and I would prefer that you remain more or less sober tonight - at least until I\u2019m finished with you.\"For another moment she pauses, staring blankly off toward the drink menu before continuing as if she hadn't stopped speaking, \"With that in mind, I might suggest a bottle of Silverleaf, if you are partial to wine, and either Dragon\u2019s Roar or Blizzard, depending on if you would like a 'hot' or 'cold' mixed drink, respectively. Either that, or you could name any other sort of beverage, and it will come to this table.\u201dIn this, Naoki seems rather confident. The Sun\u2019s collection of alcohol is quite expansive.

Through the double doors, Cecil the innkeeper sits on his stool behind the counter.  Naoki greets him by name as she proceeds around the side of the desk to stand behind Cecil, in front of the key rack. Putting a hand to her chin, she considers the keys that are present- the rooms that are unoccupied.

She twirls the key on its chain as she turns immediately to the right at the top of the stairs, and a few paces more to a door bearing a plaque reading, \u201c12.\u201d As Naoki unlocks the door, Torrin would be able to see that the key is a finely made, an elegant thing bearing a gemstone; a gem that seems identical to one embedded into the surface of the lock.i.imgur.com/KaknLW1.jpg In any case, the door opens, and Naoki proceeds inside. The room is a large one, specifically, intended for guests that wouldn\u2019t easily fit into furniture designed for humans. The ceiling, for instance, is significantly further overhead than one might expect. But perhaps the most obvious thing is the bed, which is much longer and wider than any other bed for two might be. Turning around to face Torrin, Naoki speaks and steps backward. \u201cHave this room for as long as you need, until something more permanent can be arranged. For anything to do with it, you can speak to Cecil down there.\u201d She gestures with one hand in the direction of the stairs as she uses the other to place the room\u2019s key atop the bedside table.

In the dark. A gesture lights the candles as Naoki gets to her feet, mumbling something rude about her method of transport.Standing, she\u2019s greeted by the sight of her old office and pauses for a moment as the memories come rushing back. That\u2019s her desk, her chair, the very same rug. It\u2019s been at least a few years since Naoki was last in here, and there\u2019s a certain amount of nostalgia to be had.Trailing her fingers through the layer of dust, Naoki idly winds her way around to the back of the desk and sits, for the view she once had so often. Though she took the essential items, many of her possessions have sat here the whole time, leading the office to look more or less just as it always was, minus the dust.Her memories of The Midnight Sun are primarily pleasant. This desk, these chairs, this is where she first met so many people. For the time that she was here, Naoki made many friends -- many of whom she retains, and amassed considerable wealth. In hindsight,  it seems like a good chapter, Naoki thinks, a stepping stone. The skills she developed here in business and economic affairs eventually served as one of the primary qualifications behind her being appointed Minister of Finance.When she was elected Lady of Isra, Naoki made a deal with one of her existing business partners, Mr. @calico. By the terms of the agreement, Naoki retained ownership of The Sun but handed the management role to him, as well as a portion of the revenue stream in payment. In the years since then, The Sun has continued to be a wildly profitable business for them both, though not quite as much as it once was, and not quite with as much excitement, as Naoki took her moving and shaking to The Citadel.Passing through the door behind her chair, Naoki tenses as she realizes what\u2019s in this room -- the bedroom. The bedroom in which she hid during that first, terrible crisis, and more significantly, the bedroom she once shared with Artemis. ...For a few moments, Naoki is still, her expression blank as her eyes sweep the room over.\u2026She bites her tongue and steels her expression to keep from sobbing. Hand still on the doorknob, she looks the room over again angrily, searching for some item to take and leave with, to justify her peeking. But there isn\u2019t anything of value, sentimental or otherwise, that she can reasonably justify taking. She exits, nearly slamming the door behind her with an irritable huff. She takes a deep breath. \u2026 And another. \u2026 And it\u2019s time to move on to the next thing. She came here- to The Sun, not the office, for a reason, and it\u2019s time to Do the Things, with the People. As she Does, as the Leader.Another gesture returns darkness to the room as Naoki exits out into the hallway, re-locking the door behind herself and not looking back.Later\u2026 Empress Naoki sits in her favorite booth in the corner, idly fiddling with a gemstone. With a small measure of disgust, she realizes the seat is still warm. A group had been sitting here, but convincing them to move was not difficult, she found. But, ew.Pushing the matter from her mind, Naoki considers her upcoming meeting with Jun. It\u2019s been a bit of a while since they\u2019ve properly sat down to talk, and Naoki has a few items she intends to bring up, though she doesn\u2019t want to make this seem like a business meeting.What it is is Naoki making good on a deal she made wherein Jun would treat Naoki to lunch. When the lunch is free, and Naoki chooses the time and place, it\u2019s not really that, she supposes, but the result is effectively the same, and she isn\u2019t one to get caught in semantics in situations like these.She chose The Sun as the location for a few reasons, the primary thought being that of all the places where they potentially could get lunch, The Sun is the only one to be unrelated to business, have good food, and not be The Eclipse\u2026 Which she really wouldn\u2019t want to visit with Jun in any given case, even though that topic has since been put to rest.

The celebration of Yuletide here -- it\u2019s based primarily on old, half-forgotten pre-cataclysm traditions. Hasn\u2019t been celebrated by anyone much for aaaages and ages. Yuletide in Isra for these first few years will be exactly what we make it out to be, so I think expectations are more or less nonexistent.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m giving gifts because there\u2019s a plausible reason to do so and I enjoy doing it.

You know me.\u201dJust then, the waiter returns with their drinks. Jun\u2019s coffee comes in a delicate little mug imported from Katashima -- saucer and all, and Naoki\u2019s blizzard comes in a tall, straight glass which serves to showcase the beverage\u2019s gentle undulation.Naoki thanks him, and he promptly excuses himself. Before continuing, Naoki takes the top off her drink, and as she is, begins to brandish one finger at Jun. It looks like Naoki has an idea to share. She sets the glass down, \u201cI have a gentleman with an office over at The Eclipse who handles Acquisition for me. I give him a list, preferably as detailed as possible.

As much as he loathed to admit it he'd come to this seedy bar for one thing: The Silverleaf wine. It seemed even a solemn figure such as he could do with a small taste of nostalgia. It had been centuries since he'd been to the elven lands and, no wine he'd tasted had seemed quite so sweet as his home's.As the group began to speak, however, he realized how things had left the realms of his former, relaxing plan. They were discussing Nalista. For a moment he merely listened to their awkward introductions. They certainly did not seem like adventurers powerful enough to combat her, let alone retrieve the crown, however\u00a0 at least someone had responded to the summons. No, they were sure to meet their fates and, despite not caring about them individually, he did have a stake in their success.

She blinked a couple of times and squinted before noticing a scar on his hand and clothing that didn't resemble that of a school uniform. Could he be another adventurer to join them?But many things were spoken and though they may have mistaken Misaika's silence and tipsiness for being disengaged in the conversation, she was listening -  and understanding. But her reaction may not have been entirely appropriate due to being two manastorm lager down. \"Yes! We want more money!

Well, she did appreciate his attention to details, something she was quite fond of herself, but right now she was more interested in another manastorm lager and ordered another one before greedily grasping it when the bartender served it to her. This spirited beverage had seemed just to Misaika's taste though she was starting to feel slightly tipsy. Anyway they all seemed to readily ignore her by now and even Roxanne was too caught up in explaining the finer points of getting sticky with the empress to be very concerned about Misaika - a solitude that suited Misaika rather well for now.

He didn't seem like much and yet, as he inspected him, he could swear there was something...darker about him. His own magic, innate and learned, quivered almost imperceptibly.

'Aged hit her harder' What was that supposed to mean? \"Roxanne, I believe the Keph boy just called you old.\" Misaika explained and crossed her arms. Or maybe she had mistakon Estevano for a women - he did look rather old that guy. It was a relatively crude insult nevertheless, but then again the boy seemed to be a mute and using a notebook for communicating. This presented an opportunity, Misaika thought. With a quick movement Misaika would try to snatch Keph's notebook from his hands so that he wouldn't be able to insult the group any further - of course with this strengthening Keph's image of her being a thief. Misaika would try to hold the notebook out of his reach even while she spoke with Alured. As Alured eerily turned his head towards Misaika - she would mirror his movement trying to get eye contact though it seemed difficult with his mask on. The answer was disappointing but somewhat predictable. 2500 gold was still a large sum of money and with bonuses for swatting the spider drow, they might even earn a lot more. \"Why don't you remove your lovely mask and let me have a look at that pretty elf face, Mr. Alured?\" she said with a smirk, trying to flirt as subtly as possibly, though in her current state it would be obvious to most, what her intentions were. The fact that her words would reveal Alured's little secret hadn't crossed her mind at all. It seemed thought hat Alured was adamant that Keph 'the-great-mute-hunter-currently-without-notebook' would be joining and Misaika sighed accepting the fact. If she had succeeded holding on to the notebook until now, she would rather reluctantly give it back to Keph before making a quick but rather crude sketch vaguely resembling Keph as a stick figure foolishly drawing his bow backwards while sticking his tongue out with a loony expression to his face. \"There you go 'legendary Keph'!\" she said and grinned deviously.

Well... a liiitle tipsy maybe...\" Misaika answered and tried to keep a calm expression, though she wasn't very fond of being questioned like this. Her answer didn't seem to satisfy the girl whom she had forgotten the name of and the tall foreigner - whom she had currently also forgotten the name of - and they seemed to be plotting leaving her and Keph out. \"What I bring..?\" Misaika asked with a low voice as her eyes fell to the drawing the guy was pointing at. Why couldn't this just be a casual and fun conversation about getting to know each other? At this point Misaika could hardly gather herself around a sales pitch drawing forth her own qualities - something she'd have a hard enough time doing sober anyway. She had abilities, but how they would compare in battle was difficult to say. But of course it was never her intention of joining a suicide mission. Misaika crossed her arms, this was a rather unfair trial she was given in front of their employer. \"Well who's asking? The 'candy shop' worker?\" She said and accentuated the words 'candy shop'. \"... or the middle aged guy with the bulk that looks like his clothes came straight from a play ABOUT adventuring?\" she asked with a sudden snarly voice. \"Besides there isn't many driders in Isra to show my skill on.\" she said and turned her face away from Estevano. She sure preferred a little less bickering than this.The mood was tense and it seemed like Alured sensed the same thing. Misaika sighed. Now she was the one feeling unsure about the others. She wasn't a front line fighter and she hardly knew what kind of fighter she was but she was not unreliable and wanted them to know at least that much. \"I'm not cut out for fighting in the front line and you will most likely have to protect me - that probably makes me a liability to you yes.\" Misaika said and reached inside her hood and and loosed a silver amulet with a cross shaped insignia on it and put it on the table. She then swiftly smacked her hand down on the amulet and the moment she raised her hand a rather bulky and worn looking black grimoire with yellowed pages appeared with the same insignia on the front page that her amulet had carried. \"I have a few spells handy that should be of help, but many of them need concentration and preparation.\" Misaika explained. Well she hadn't really used any real combat spells yet as she had never had to, but there were other spells to aid ones fortunes she was already accustomed to casting. Well of course this didn't mean she wasn't still nervous about going on such a perilous adventure, but as things stood she seemed forced to make her spells and abilities count in other places that just inside a dark chamber in one of the magical institutions in Isra.

He was raised without having to supply much other than a smile to get his way. She caught the bag of out muscle memory her reflexes reacting to something being tossed at her. It almost went back towards his head but she was not paying for his own supplies. She barely had enough for her own. \u201cAn hour past dawn,\u201d she told him sharply and turned on her heel. Trusting that saying anything else would further be a mistake she did not care for his rambling further and if she gave him more reason to comment upon her difference in upbringing he might. Setting out across town he was right about one thing it was more familiar to her than him. Her skin might have been darker than they liked in one that appeared to be an elf but her coin spent just as well as the next. Her anger reined in now her demeanor had to be acceptable if she was to get what she needed. Lashing out at a merchant who chose to make offhanded comments would only get her in trouble with the local authorities. The guards of the city were not terribly easy to anger but they would believe one of their own before an outsider. Seeing to it that they had rations for a few weeks she had two separate packs. Hopefully his highness could support his own, if not they could get a pack horse in the morning. Spending his money only on his own rations and supplies she did not wish to use it for hers. It meant accepting a favor from a man she could not yet stand. The local smithy might be able to provide the scraps she needed to work with in order to cobble together something resembling a saddle. Finding nothing suitable for a price he was willing to let go she would approach the stable master hoping that some of the old tack might be salvageable. He brought out a very thin leather piece made for couriers on short routes. It was not the sort of comfort one generally wanted but it provided some cushion between horse and rider. Agreeing upon a price she took it off his hands and put it onto the stable wall by her horse along with the bridal that had no bit upon it. Preparations made she settled in for the night remaining in the stable itself. Lodging was another expense and one not necessary. Sleeping under the stars most nights it did not harm her to find a bed of hay and a bedroll that cushioned some of the poking of it. Arranging a bath in the morning so she didn\u2019t insult his majesty was also in order. Placing her bracers on the next morning she would secure her bedroll behind the saddle and the saddle bags with her own rations. His were carried in an old sack that the miser who\u2019d sold her the supplies could spare. Mounting up she was at the gate but half an hour past dawn. Her horse was a Percheron with dappled grey coloring around its haunches and a height well of 18 hands. Its tail was brushed thoroughly and its mane was braided down the side to keep it from interfering with its vision. A type of draft horse she was thick and steady upon her feet and unafraid of work. More common as war horses than for a slip of a girl such as herself it made her appear quite small on its large back her feet not quite hitting the bottom of her ribs. Her black cloak from yesterday had been folded and tucked away behind her and underneath the bed roll. Instead she wore a thick wool in a charcoal grey. Inconspicuous and without decoration.\u00a0Hands free before her the reins of the horse resting lightly along its neck she had his coin pouch in her lap.

Just as he had said he was going back in to the Midnight sun to have yet another glass of the Daevaris vintage. What a joy it was to taste the elven grapes and their dancing lusciousness on his tongue - it was a far cry from anything else they served and reminded him of home. A warm content seemed to settle inside Vithkun's chest as he twirled it around a bit. However the nostalgia didn't last very long as two burly faced thug like humanoids in a sour mood entered the bar along with a halfling who whispered to them. \"Yes, yes Myra was here not long ago..!\" he said hastily.\"But where is she NOW?!?\" the half orc asked the halfling angrily as the halfling stepped back a few paces. \"S-she was talking to him. YES she was talking to that one!\" the halfling said and pointed to Vithkun as the two pair of heavy boots came marching over the floor. Vithkun's ears did not fail to pick up their conversation although their harsh ungentle voices were gratingly displeasing. The half orc who seemed to lead put his fat hand on Vithkun's shoulder. \"You were talking to a drow named Myra. Where is she now, elf?\" he asked impatiently. Vithkun gave him half a glance and then went for another sip of the wine.\"Don't worry about it, you probably don't want to find her. She's in a worse mood then you.\" he said giving even the weight of the half orc's hand little attention. Instead his index finger started to draw on the hilt of his sword. \"Well I don't care, she owes us money for the lost shipment and someone is going to pay!\" he persisted as the half orc spun him around and rather firmly pushed Vithkun towards the bar desk by his shoulder. Vithkun sighed, he really couldn't be bothered with these type right now. \"Being forced to look upon your face is the last thing I want right now. I assume your mother wanted a new anvil but got you instead and decided it could be both.\" Vithkun said as he could swear he could see the cogs trying to turn behind his eyes to understand his insult giving him more than ample time to see when the attack came. Telegraphed and straight forward the half orc threw a punch at Vithkun's face though this time he was prepared and dodged beneath it. Vithkun drew his sword in the same motion thrusting the hilt of it into the orc's stomach. Not with a strength that would normally cause trouble for one as muscle bound as this but having inscribed a few elvish words of magic into it, the force of the thrust was now in the hundreds of pounds as the half orc was sent tumbling back into a few tables before crumbling from the abdominal pain it seemed to have caused. Vithkun turned to look at the second guy with a gaze that could best be described as being cold and unfriendly and the second guy didn't look as if he wanted to press his luck waving his hands in front of him as Vithkun sheathed his sword and emptied the last contents of his glass. It seemed while he had hear do his errands the gods wanted Vithkun to handle her business. Annoying but even if she was a drow - and a stingy and largely unpleasant one - he found it despicable to settle debts like this. The morning after presented him with a relatively agreeable weather without too many clouds and standing on the balcony of his hotel he almost forgot about the journey. However a pleasant breakfast with tea and the likes after he gathered his things and headed towards the eastern gate. It fitted quite well in his backpack though it was a long time since he had packed it so it took a little extra time. Arriving at the eastern gate Vithkun was - perhaps a little late. The sun did already shone over the walls of Isra and activity was bustling as merchants, peasants and adventurers were out and about. \"Well good morning Myra, are we a little early?\" he asked with a smug smile but was actually pleasantly surprised that she had come and not run - especially considering his run in with her thug friends yesterday. She would immediately notice that Vithkun was not only late but lacking one quite important thing - a horse. \"Have you put the money to good use then?\" he asked inquiringly.

If he were to meet Khepri in her room it would be on his own terms. And that meant he needed to get a bath that wasn't a wash in a creek or icy pond. He had to go back to the stable to fetch his saddle bags and necessaries, before going to his own room on the second floor. The room was richer than anything he had seen in his life, with fabrics costing more than the armor he wore on the bed alone. He couldn't bear the thought of sinking into them in his dirty traveling clothes, so he undressed standing up, hopping on one foot as he wrestled off his riding boots. He set his clothes in a pile outside the door for them to be cleaned, along with his riding boots and golden spurs to be polished.Once freed of his clothes, he found that a bath with piping hot water was magically filled as he approached the tub, as if the room was begging him to get clean before he contemplated a thought of slipping between the sheets. He obliged willingly, grabbing out his bar of soap, comb, and razor from his saddle bags before dipping into the refreshing water. He soaked for several minutes before scrubbing himself thoroughly all over his soap bar made of honey and lemon.\u00a0Finally clean from all the dirt from the road, Rudiger sat himself on a stool in front of the mirror as he carefully groomed himself.

He feigns drunkenness, a few words stumbling out of his mouth in slurred, broken sentences telling the bartender to keep his tab open as he goes for a walk.He stumbles just out of eyesight and then straightens up, slithering between patrons as he scans the crowded bar, examining the building's superstructure. He is no architect, but his many travels into shaky tunnels and ancient grand libraries has taught him a healthy knowledge of which struts make what fall, and which wall-lines hold up which roofing things. It's a rudimentary knowledge, but enough, he hopes, to blow the cap off this vile place. As he sidles nonchalantly about the room, ethanol drips in a thin, yet steady stream from beneath his cloak as one long fingernail invades the opening of his cask, wide enough to burn well but subtle enough to be masked by the other smells about the room. He stops a few times to chat with various denizens, laughing and carrying on with them, before excusing himself and continuing his dastardly work.Before long, his liquid fuse has been set, and he goes about sprinkling unassuming piles of Sal Vitriolus about the supports he believes to be essential to the structural integrity. Finally, after nearly an hour of preparation, almost long enough for the ethanol to evaporate into useless vapour, Tris returns to mingle near the bar, slowly working a large, murky golden glass flask from his belt. It contains two atria separated by a thin layer of glass: one atrium contains a fine, sparkling white dust. The other, a viscous, indeterminable liquid. Without a word of warning, without eloquent evil speech or a prayer muttered in reverence, without so much as a flinch, Tris raises the flask into the air and throws it violently at the ground below him, in the same motion twirling about and covering himself with his cloak.There is a stiff millisecond of silence as the surrounding patrons observe his strange behaviour. Their thoughts in that split second range from confusion to bewilderment to ridicule. And then, the glass shatters and the two substances within stir together.BOOOOOOOMIn a flash, the eardrum-shattering explosion vaporises the surrounding patrons, sending shards of glass and stone and wood flying in all directions. The \"fuse\" is ignited, and several other explosions ring out in rapid succession among the crowd. Tris is thrown a hundred feet through a wall of the Midnight Sun, knocking the wind from him and cracking a few ribs, as well as causing a few fractures throughout his arms and legs. His cloak glows bright with Dwarven runes as he pulls himself across the ground, escaping from the chaos he's caused. As he turns about and looks back, the sight is one that makes his heart soar, though a twinge of disappointment sours his mood a touch as he realises that only half of the smoldering structure seems to be collapsing, the lopsided cathedral of a bar shifting as weight is redistributed onto the remaining support beams. Cries ring out across the nexus, screams of the terrified masses fleeing the slaughter. A pang of regret slams into Tris' chest as he realises the death he's wrought, but the elation of his triumphant destruction of that evil, evil place is hard to overcome.The half-Fae shakily pulls a healing draught from his pack and slurps up the roiling green liquid, giving him just enough strength to pull himself up from the ground and begin to hobble off, slipping into the stampede of frightened souls and disappearing into the crowd. Tris may later come to regret the loss of life he's caused on this day, but today he will rejoice. The establishment that killed his father was dealt a crippling blow, and even if it isn't fatal, he hopes to make a loud and powerful statement. Still, he can not yet reveal himself. As hard as it was to plan this destruction, it would be infinitely harder to plan the execution of an empress. And suddenly, his eyes open. Perhaps his brain has simply been shaken loose by the explosion, but a radical idea occurs to him. Revolution. \"Empress\" Naoki was and is a tyrant, and Tris' rage ironically blinded him to the greater evil she represented. He could not take her down alone, and nor should he.

The ideal result for this layout would have been to have the city split into nine different districts, eight sections of the wagon wheel with the Citadel forming the centerpiece. Unfortunately, daily life seems to ever obfuscate the best-laid dreams of city planners.

Small stalls gave way to brick and mortar stores, with little tents doting the sidewalks, each attempting to tempt potential customers nearby. Anyone traveling down Moloch Street would inexorably find themselves torn off in wild directions into the heart of the bazaar. And The Midnight Sun always stood as the focal point. Except today, things are different. Moloch Street is closed off by enormous wagons positioned end to end. Guards stand atop the vehicles, standing at attention and occasionally barking warning out to anyone who steps too close. The most disturbing aspect of today is the Grand Bazaar is closed, as is The Midnight Sun. For the first time in years, its doors are shut.A large black carriage slowly pushes its way through the crowd before reaching the barricade.

This body wasn\u2019t too badly burned, but several long gashes across the neck and upper chest along with bits of shrapnel in the torso spell out the cause of death. Jenkins uses a small stick to help him look through pockets and up shirt sleeves. All the while, both guards talk back and forth to each other in short phrases, commenting on what they find. They might have been two gardeners talking about their rose gardens for how easily they talk about the carnage before them. This continues for some time as elf and woman move from body to body. Uncover, examine, record, recover. By the end, they have marked out six bodies for additional investigator back at headquarters.

Keep the bodies we marked separate from the rest and put them nearer the door, then contact headquarters to have them send a wagon over to pick the cadavers up.\u201dThe two salute each other and walk off.

Her eyes could not peel away from the small body underneath the sheet as it was carried away. Small crimson dots where the sheet touched exposed muscle and bone slowly expanded, soaking into the white cloth.Arya could not handle much more emotionally, or physically. Even before this incident, she was more than familiar with burns. She had felt her very own skin burn away almost completely after being hit with the fire of a dragon she had faced. She had been very close to dying that, day... but she didn't. She was lucky to have survived. The paladin remembered the pain most of all, covering her entire body in screaming agony. In those moments she remembered wanting to die, rather than feel that pain for a moment longer. Arya could empathize perfectly with these people, though doing that only made things harder.\u00a0On top of that, she had seen her home and loved ones burned to ash by flows of lava and had vowed to save any she could from then on. That was the reason she became a paladin. Arya thought she moved on from that terrible event in her life, but even now she felt just as helpless as she did back then watching her father get swallowed up by lava. She was lucky to survive herself then too.\u00a0\u00a0Ayra had no more time to brood, however, as yet another patient was brought before her.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "When the explosion rocked the city, Arya was initially as surprised as anyone.

Splitting them quite evenly they were loosely held together by the muscle and sinew surrounding them and could be shifted and rubbed together if one was not careful. Small scrapes decorated his arms and a few gashes had found their way to his sides.

It would stop on its own merit clotting soon enough but his leg would not be so lucky. Coughing in the dust that settled he reached down tearing his shirt around the bottom of the fabric leaving the edges tattered and barely enough to cover himself. He had a pocket of air where he was trapped and the slightest bit of room which allowed him to reach downward and wrap the fabric above his wound. Tightening it as best as possible it slowed the bleeding to a trickle. His breaths came with ever worsening despair at his attempts his chest heaving with the effort. Relaxing back there was not much to do other than to wait. Screaming might hurry aid but with the chaos he heard around him he doubted he was the first on anyone\u2019s list.

Though she knows the circumstances that brought about their deaths were beyond her control, it still feels like a personal failure to have protected them. At some point, there must have been something she could have done. Could more stringent regulations on volatile alchemical ingredients have prevented this? Something could have. With the near-absolute level of control The Empress has over both Isra and The Midnight Sun, there was, at some point, some action she could have taken to prevent this tragedy.

A mixture of bricks, structural beams, broken furniture, and smaller things such as mugs and cutlery, stacked into a pile by the rescuers to get it out of the way.

It seems as if there were multiple blasts; there must have been. A single explosion wouldn\u2019t necessarily have made a nice neat round hole, but a single blast powerful enough to bring down half the building would have damaged the walls more than it did, and done more damage to the second and third floors. As it stands, it looks like the second and third floors have collapsed downward and burned, but are otherwise more or less intact. Multiple blasts localized to the first floor imply either some sort of freak chain-reaction of drinks or a deliberate act of sabotage.This does not bode well, and The Empress frowns, more than she has been.
