Together, and through much negotiation they would decide, with the help of a silent investor, to invest in a new establishment, somewhere the rich and powerful would convene, somewhere they could both make a fortune in an industry they both understood intimately. They named it the Violet Star Brothel. The brothel would be the best in the city, and both ladies invested a good deal of gold into it to make it that way. It boasts several, lavishly decorated rooms, a smoking lounge, a full bar, a cloak room, and even private bathing suites, but the crown jewel of the Star are the ladies. With a bit of persuasion from Fi, and the business smarts of Yelan, they were able to convince some of the best, most gorgeous private escorts and courtesans to sign on and work for them, providing Isra\u2019s elite with absolute perfection. The building itself sits on the corners of Jacob Clyde Street and Empire Boulevard, which is to most prime real estate, owing to the considerable foot traffic and night life of the area. What the building was before its purchase doesn\u2019t matter much anymore, only the fact that it is build strong, and clad in bricks of sandstone all along the back, contrasting against the dark wooden beams that intersect it and the tall windows that peer out onto the street. The bottom floor\u2019s windows are hidden by the thick folds of velvet curtains, curtailing any would-be peeping toms. There are many rooms to explore, and possibly be explored in, that make up the Star, each as lavishly decorated as the last. The bottom floor is made up almost entirely of the dimly lit lounge, usually inhabited by the scantily clad roster of women and their prospective clients before they\u2019re stolen away to the rooms beyond. Here, clients can pick and choose their fantasies, regale each other of their conquests, or just enjoy a nice cold drink from the bar before they receive everything they've ever wanted. Of course, before they even get this far, most would find themselves starting in a small room with nothing more than a counter and a comfortable lounge on which to wait. Those who find themselves here will be greeted by one of my many friendly faces, and shown inside to a world of warmth, security, and absolute pleasure. If you have coin and are looking for a wonderful evening, look no further than the Violet Star. The roster of ladies is hand-picked and personally tested by the always-glamorous and illustrious madams, Fiona Blythe and Yelan'Nalest, from a pool of the most beautiful and talented courtesans of all of Isra, including...Fiona Blythe, co-owner and proprietor of the Violet Star and known very well in the circles that would hire such a woman. Though still largely operating independently, she still makes time to spend at the Star, either helping with paperwork, but more importantly working the lounge and catering to the rich and famous that frequent and spend their gold for her talented services. Yelan'Nalest, co-owner and proprietor of the Violet star, and sole owner of the Emerald Finch in the outer Isran ring. A gorgeous Av' woman who has been in the business ever since she discovered how easy it is to make money on her back, and eventually how much she could make when others did it for her. A career madam, she does the day-to-day operations for the Star, but like Fiona, always finds time to make some money for herself. Where's the fun in paperwork if you can't get hands-on? Yala'Ni, the Star's other Av'. Tall, beautiful, and following in her mother's footsteps, Yala came to this life when she came of age and began working for her mother, Yelan. This stunning creature one day has aspirations to operate her own brothel, but for now she makes her money doing what she does best; pleasure. Ghyen Drumnar, the beautiful Orcish maiden. Don't be fooled by her rippling muscles and imposing height, for on the inside Ghyen has a heart of gold. She's more than happy to play the part of the evil or domineering orc, but finds much more enjoyment playing the deceptive submissive role for her clients. It usually makes more money, she finds. This muscled buxom beauty also acts as the Bordello's more public security when she's not otherwise occupied. Cassandra Nazem, the dark elf from parts unknown. Quiet, sweet, and methodical are the best ways to describe the naturally gorgeous elf that resides with the Bordello. This one came to Isra for fortune and fame, and found such things in a world she didn't expect. She eventually made a name for herself as a master of knots and chains, whips and wax, and ways to make a client scream her name, betraying her more outward appearance of quiet serenity. Of course, she will still cater to her clients' other wants and needs, but she knows where her specialties lay. Lily Anderson, the somewhat foul mouthed sailor woman hailing from Libertalia. Back home, she once worked at the illustrious Babette's, the brothel owned by the 'pirate queen' Johnnie O'Malley. She made a reputation for herself as being one of the most beautiful ladies on Libertalia, and decided to take her talents to the shores of Isra, knowing just how much money they were rumoured to spend on such services. She was not wrong. Now, after being approached for her more unique style, exceptional skills in the bedroom, and reputation by Fiona, she finds herself working with the gorgeous ranks of the Violet Star. Abigail \u201cThe Duchess\u201d Holland comes from high-born blood, the daughter of an Isran nobleman. She found herself in a rebellious stage in her early adult life after years of her father coddling and taking on a hellishly overbearing parenting style, which lead her into the money-making business in her clients' arms as a 'fuck-you' to her father. Turns out, she's extremely good at what she does as long as her clients know that she's in charge, and that you're very little compared to her. To hire her is a privilege, and she will remind you of that. Submission, however, is very often rewarded with a mind-blowing experience. Nadia el-Mansoor comes from a more exotic, far off land. She's exceptionally well presented and well to do, and though also from noble blood, she provides a warm presence that seems to calm anyone in the room. Her methods are more intimate, holding her clients close and making them feel loved, and like a someone. Some would even call her approach wholesome, if not for the nature of her business. Many find warmth and love within her arms that leaves them ending their time with her with feeling of peace in their heart. Finally, Ronwe, the demon of knowledge and Keeper of Secrets. Able to shape-shift into her client's most desired partner, she commands an incredible price at the Star. She'll use her demonic magics and natural skills to make her clients feel a pleasure many would kill for. (Played by TheRose202)Best of all, the roster still has slots available, and they're hiring! Inquire within. Though not on the roster and not available for hire, the Violet Star is also home to yet another beauty; Ashley Donner, but instead of making her fortune with her body, she makes her living behind the Violet Star's well stocked bar, mixing cocktails and pouring pints with skills to match even the most veteran barkeep. Her beauty matches the ladies that work around her, and she isn't shy about their kind of work either, but the closest she'll get to such work is the not uncommon sight of her pouring drinks with her breasts laid bare or even in the buff, should the tips be good enough that evening. Come one, come all to the Violet Star, where your fantasies await to be fulfilled! If you have the coin, that is... Player's notes: Anything that goes on in the Star's private rooms is to be kept board-appropriate, otherwise PM's would be more appropriate. Not all ladies on the roster will be available all the time, it will depend entirely on their player's availability. Thank you for your consideration!

The bar is fully stocked and the bartender, Ashley Donner, fully stacked, wearing a very low cut top above her split skirt and apron. Bottles of all kinds of liquor stand behind the bar, as well as three tremendous kegs of ale that are kept cold by ice talismans suspended above them, connected via magical tether to a magical plate along the keg\u2019s roof. In the lounge, the pillows are fluffed, the couches freshly upholstered, and the candles lit, casting a warm, inviting glow over the room\u2019s interior. Large hookahs had been set up in one corner, allowing clients to enjoy a relaxing smoke as they make their decisions for the night, and the carpets freshly beaten. Of course, the main attractions to such a place are more than ready, milling about the lounge and excitedly chatting about such an exceptional evening. Each one is dressed in a well tailored outfit, some more skimpy than others, some more conservative, and some little more than lingerie, but each knew it wouldn\u2019t be for very long anyway. The opening night is bound to be busy, and they had all gotten plenty of rest. Upstairs on the third floor, Fiona Blythe and Yelan\u2019Nalest discuss their strategy for such a night, which soon devolves into a giddy discussion on how much gold they predict they\u2019ll make. The answer is simple; plenty, enough to get them started on getting their return on investment from such a place. Its not long before they come down to the main lounge, with Yelan clapping her hands to get everyone\u2019s attention. \u201cLadies,\u201d she calls out, a large grin across her face. \u201cToday is the beginning of a new, beautiful era for prostitution in Isra. It's the beginning of rediscovery, pleasure filled nights, and most importantly, more profit than any of us know what to do with.\u201d That gets a chuckle from the gathered women, but they all kept a professional composure. \u201cWe\u2019ve gathered only the best of the best, each of you hand selected for this establishment. We\u2019ve already begun to get a reputation for being the best among those we\u2019ve invited tonight, but its important we live up to said reputation. I want your best work tonight.\u201d Her eyes dance from woman to woman as she grins. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve seen each of your best. This will be a piece of cake.\u201d Fiona has since moved to the bar and ordered a glass of wine, letting her business partner do the talking. Yelan claps her hands and grins. \u201cSo!\u201d she begins. \u201cIts opening night. Shall we get started? \u201cCassandra, be a dear and begin your shift on the counter, hm?\u201d \u201d The ladies give an excited nod and resume their posts, lounging around and making themselves presentable, while the resident dark elf makes for the reception and closes the doors behind her. Tonight is indeed a special night for all involved, from the ladies of the lounge to the bosses, to even a silent investor or two. Most importantly, however, it would be an exciting night for the select few VIPs who received invitations for such a night, people who could appreciate the women and the services provided, and with an offer of a free drink from their talented barmaid, made up of the finest liquors around, how could they refuse?So come one, come all, to the fabulous Violet Star, now open for business!

Not an actual mirror of course, she would never debase herself to using such primitive mortal constructs, but a perfectly copied illusory double of her current self.She turns this way and that, and her double follows. Currently she wears a pair of thigh-high black leather heels and a set of black panties with pink frills at the edges, going bare but for a set of tasseled golden pasties up top. She sticks out her tongue and snaps her fingers, the clothing dissolving with a flare. Ghyen, the orc girl with whom Ronwe was beginning to develop an affectionate friendship with, had suggested the outfit, but in the demon's eyes it's just too...gaudy.Placing a slender index fingertip upon her chin in thought, Ronwe runs one hand slowly down the gentle curve of one of her bizarrely-shaped horns, pursing her lips. She snaps again and a shear white lace cropped corset top materializes upon her torso, a very, very thin pair of stringed white panties following shortly after.On second thought, white isn't really her colour. She shakes her head and snaps again, and the clothing burns away once more. She opts for a fancier, yet not quite so loud approach. Another snap and a skin-tight and dangerously thin black silk strapless cocktail dress appears wrapped about her body, leaving just enough to the imagination to still be enticing whilst putting her best assets on display. It's short enough that it just barely conceals what's underneath -- that being, of course, bare flesh and nothing else.A pair of black leather strapped sandal heels appear upon her feet, raising her height a few inches. Sterling silver bands materialize around her horns, accentuating their curved t-shaped lengths with a gentle glimmer, followed by crescent moon earrings upon the tips of her elf-like pointed ears, made of the same material. A chain of alternating black onyx and sterling silver plates secures itself about her neck, looking nearly tight enough to choke her.Ronwe looks herself up and down in the mirror image and nods with satisfaction, turning on the ball of her foot and stepping out toward the staircase down to the lounge. As she overtakes the last step she nods in greeting to her coworkers. She finds a spot to the right of Ghyen, trailing her long, pink nails gently down the center of the subby orc girl's back as she moves in to stand next to her while the madames speak. She says nothing during their pep talk, but as soon as the courtesans are dismissed to prepare, Ronwe turns to Ghyen and gives her a sharp-toothed grin.\"So, girly,\" begins the greed demoness in her sweetest dulcet tones, \"excited for the big night?\"Ronwe has recently taken a liking to the orc girl, and she's not been subtle about it. From gentle coaxing to outright telepathic imagery to a soft, well-timed touch here and there, Ronwe's been doing what she does best to Ghyen: manipulating her for entirely greedy and selfish reasons into desiring the demon's intimate companionship.At least, that's what Ronwe would like to believe. It's unbecoming of the Bearer of Truth to feel genuine affection, and for the Underlord's sake the girl's life will be but a tiny blip upon Ronwe's own potentially eternal existence. Still, Ronwe can't help but like the girl, for reasons even she doesn't fully understand.

Might make after-hours a little more fun.\u201d The truth is, she loved the attention she got from Ronwe. Yes, Ghyen is very attractive, but there are some who are either put off a little, or have heard too many stories about orcs and their short temper. Ghyen was very much the opposite, instead having a fuze longer then the distance between Isra and the shores of Libertalia, which according to their own Libertalian Lily is quite the distance. Still, some are a little too cautious for her liking, but not Ronwe. However, Ghyen knew it was because Ronwe is a demon, an orc couldn\u2019t even make a dent in that horned woman, but she also knew they were a little more\u2026 selfish, might be the right word. As far as Ghyen is concerned, its just Ronwe flirting like anyone else, or even for her own motives. A shame really. She could enjoy having a buxom, brave, bold demon around. Ah well, she\u2019ll be content with the flriting for now. Ronwe has the benefit of deciding when she wishes to get pregnant, if ever. So far, in the many millennia she's been existent, she's always decided against it. It seems like such a hassle, raising a kid that won't end up screwed up in some way. Especially a half-mortal kid. Her half-demon nieces and nephews were proof enough of that -- most half-mortals can't resist the debased urges of demonhood, which would be fine if only they could handle the demonic magic that came with indulging it. Damned either way, though she supposes that's not exactly a negative statement for her kind.Point being she refused the offer of the birth control pendant, preferring to rely upon her own magics of prevention. Still, the pearl looks good on the orc. Ronwe wraps her arm around Ghyen's neck, using her inspection of the necklace as an excuse to drape herself about the tribal girl. It seems that in the span of an eyeblink Ronwe has gotten taller, tall enough to slide her arm comfortably around the Orc's shoulders and sidle up close. Her rapid shapeshifting is still likely disconcerting to some -- most shapeshifters go through a period of shifting and warping before they reach their intended form, yet Ronwe does not appear to change at all. She simply does.\"Indeed, this is certainly a better establishment than most of its contemporaries. I'd not be working here otherwise. The poor unfortunately do not have many secrets to offer, but the affluent? Ah, they are full of them. Every single one of their heads, filled to the brim with previously undisclosed information,\" replies Ronwe, nodding in agreement.\"As for the girls,\" she continues, a sly smirk spreading over her features, \"I've only got my eye set on one.\" She gives a devious wink.\"Mmh, speaking of, your outfit surely suits you tonight. Might be a bit on the nose, though,\" she teases, her hand drifting down dangerously close to the orc's cleavage.A series of mildly lewd images flash through Ghyen's mind involving herself and the demon, but by now Ghyen has probably pieced together that it's a mind trick by the demon herself and not a construct of the orc's subconscious, a sort of flirtatious teasing unique to the Hellscape-born woman and her mental magics. It's not the violent, traumatising breach the average mortal telepath is able to perform, though. It's soft, subtle suggestion, and to the uninitiated, completely indistinguishable from one's own thoughts. Certainly a different experience for anyone meeting Ronwe for the first time, to suddenly and unexpectedly be assailed with undeniably arousing fantasies.", "link_list": ["/post/95580/thread", "/user/3688"], "image_list": ["https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/507758551821975583/674860329007710208/VioletstartSmall.png"], "html": "<div author=\"@violetstar\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/95580/thread\" timestamp=\"1581651548\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-3688\" title=\"The Violet Star Bordello\"><img alt=\"The Violet Star Bordello Avatar\" src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/507758551821975583/674860329007710208/VioletstartSmall.png\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/95580/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1581651548000\" title=\"Feb 13, 2020 19:39:08 GMT -8\">Feb 13, 2020 19:39:08 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-3688 group-0\" href=\"/user/3688\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@violetstar\"><span itemprop=\"name\">The Violet Star Bordello</span></a></span> said:</div><u><i><b>The Orc and the Demon</b></i></u><br><br/>\u201cNot many would call me girly,\u201d Ghyen, the beautiful orcish maiden says, then smiles around her tusks. \u201cThank you.
