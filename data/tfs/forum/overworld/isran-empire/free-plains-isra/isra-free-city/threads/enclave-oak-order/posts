The meeting room for the Conclave of Archmages is also held within.Near the top of the oak of order, sitting atop a branch off-shooting from the main trunk and accessed via a small bridge hanging over a hundred meters above the forest floor, is the office of the Minister of Magic, and the leader of The Enclave. The space seems to be the main area in which he works as well, as can be seen by the various books scattered about, runes inscribed upon the floor, and the cauldron no doubt used for achemical purposes. There is also a third alcove in this room that is dedicated to several portals which can lead to several different areas within The Enclave and the surrounding forest.\u00a0Beneath the roots of the Oak of Order, is the vault. The Vault is one of the most heavily guarded and best kept secrets within The Enclave, with only a select few individuals knowing of its location as well as having access. The Vault contains all magical artifacts held by The Enclave, no doubt some of them being very destructive if they happen to fall into the wrong hands.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/JivlMk5.jpg", "https://imgur.com/a/O6wbjU7", "https://i.imgur.com/GfHPPhM.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/NW3U9FD.jpg", "https://imgur.com/a/O6wbjU7"], "html": "Another one of the trees is dedicated to the administration of The Enclave.

And what sort of magic do you plan on using? It is any of the banned forms of magic within the Empire?\"Dazien watched Felweave closely, the looking-glass he was using was a looking-glass of truth, which would mean Dazien could tell if Felweave lied, and if he did Dazien wouldn't grant him a license.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Soon enough, a mage of the Enclave approached.
