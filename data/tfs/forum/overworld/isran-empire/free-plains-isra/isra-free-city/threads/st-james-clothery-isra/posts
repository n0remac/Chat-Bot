Umbra was a dragon, after all, and had his pride when it came to appearances. Even if he had been hiding away in the sewers, having narrowly escaped a sick and abusive relationship with a more than questionable father figure, being a derelict was no excuse of dressing like one. It took him years to mold these pants out of dragon scales, and he wouldn't\u00a0accept anything less. \"I wouldn't wrap my dog's leavings in these!\", he proclaimed, skating by a devastated old lady running a textile shop.Something made his head turn. A sound, no, something more instinctive was calling out to him in this stark white building. It appeared to be in the clothing business as well, but there was nothing special about it that Umbra could discern. Nevertheless, it was as good to try as any, and besides, what seemed like a lynch mob of store owners were advancing towards him. Umbra swiftly pulled the store handle.He immediately regretted it when he set his foot inside. What was a sweet melody outside the store was a rending staccato inside.\u00a0He wasn't expecting magic. It had been so long since he had been around it and had forgotten what it felt like. And this was a different kind of magic than what he knew. Not like Jarkoopi's or his own. Much milder and more inviting. It was ironic that it was only making Umbra more uncomfortable every second.\u00a0Where was he? He felt the ripple of transport magic the second he stepped inside. The windows showed a wide open sky, but that might have been an illusion as well. Was this a witch's shop?

It was not the somber dark color that she usually went for, which must have meant that she was trying to turn over a new leaf.By the slightly glassy look to her sad blue eyes and the tear she gently wiped away with the back of her knuckle, it seemed that perhaps she was not doing as well with her transition as she had hoped. It seemed that even the furniture around within the store turned a little more her way, as if to comfort her in all of its luxurious and secure embrace.Still, another sniffle at the woman seemed composed enough. She smoothed her hands down the lace of her skirt and walked forward, looking at the boy that had wandered into her shop, shirt-less, his hair a mess, seeming as if he was waiting for a fight to happen.Genevieve blinked once, and then laughed quietly, shaking her head and putting a hand to her stomach. \"Ah, excuse my laughter, it is not at you, monsieur,\" she said and sniffled again, this time truly squaring her shoulders before she gestured toward the sofa and the beverages and cookies waiting there.\"Please, have a seat.

Even Genevieve's chair seemed to widen and lower, so she was not so much towering over Bella but of a more appropriate height that they could easily look across the coffee table from each other.The air and the magic of the store was meant to make her customers feel secure and welcomed, and also charmed, not only with the decor and the items on display, but also with its mistress, the golden-haired enchantress that was now looking at Bella with those polite -- if vaguely, barely, just-a-hint of melancholy -- blue eyes.\"You are a blacksmith in town, are you not?\" Genevieve asked, making polite conversation yet also seemed genuinely interested in getting to know the blacksmith.If Bella had been in the city long -- and she had, obviously -- then she'd know of Genevieve St. James. In particular, she'd know that she was \"merely\" a widow of the Brotherhood of the Sword (a knights guild) when she'd first come to Isra some years ago, and she'd had a lovely daughter of bare and blushing years -- nine or so -- who was Genevieve's little mini-me. She'd been all blonde curls and blue eyes, with her mother's kindness, and her name had been Odette. SHe had been a sickly child -- or so the rumors had said -- so she never went out of the house or the shop often. Back then, it had been called St. James Boutique, and had been located in another part of town.Then, tragedy had struck, and Odette died, just barely into her second digits. The St. James Boutique had boarded up and closed, and Genevieve St. James went to live with her sister, who people discovered was Queen Arianne    , the Queen of Gauldin. It was revealed then that Genevieve was the bastard daughter of the late Duke of DeMarcier, a powerful nobleman and politician of Gauldin. Of course, a whole lot of gossip had raged then -- about why she'd hidden her connection to the Duke's family or to the Royal one. A little digging revealed that she'd been of extraordinary magic ability at the Arcane Academy in Travere and had had a torrid affair with the Arch Magus. She'd run away at a young age, for reasons unknown. People gossip that perhaps it had to do with Odette's conception, but nothing had been confirmed.In any case, Genevieve had left Isra to live in Travere, closer to her sister and the new Crown Prince of Gauldin... but Genevieve -- er, Lady\u00a0Genevieve, as Queen Arianne had King Renaux of Trav\u00e9re    give her an official title and land -- was in a deep and dark depression. She kept apartments in the Hotel Auberge in Travere, and became known as the \"Grey Lady.\" Her magic infected everything within the apartments, and she was rarely ever seen. Then, one day, they say, a young man, Hansel von Dietzhoff    who was affiliated with The Kingdom of Audria    came bearing the items of Genevieve's late husband.\u00a0No one knows exactly what happened, but after the meeting with the young knight, Lady Genevieve tried to take her life. It was of no surprise, really. The ton, lords and ladies and high mucky-mucks of Travere, had assumed it would happen at some point given the deep misery Genevieve fell into after Odette's death, that a reminder of her husband's death was surely was put her over the edge. She was saved, of course, both by a doctor in Travere and by Hansel himself, but Lady Genevieve went into hiding after that, living in some... far off, back-water place somewhere.Then. Suddenly. She's back in Isra some years later, opening up the Clothery and serving Isra again. There was a lot of curiosity about the woman. So many people wanted to know what it was that happened in Genevieve's life, but the childless widow, the God-mother of the Crown Prince of Gauldin, the sister of it's Queen, was a very private woman. For all that she was warm and friendly, she was not given to gossip or to even explaining her situation.Everything known about her was known by second-hand rumors and gossip. Little was truly known about Genevieve herself, or about her husband, Sir Florian St. James, or her deceased daughter, Odette, or about any of her relationships -- with her sister, with her late father, with the late Arch Magus of Travere...... Anyway.The woman now looked at Bella with a steady and expectant gaze, sitting lady-like in her chair, looking well put together, discreetly fashionable, and of subtle wealth. Who on earth would have guessed her torrid history?

Genevieve had probably heard bits and pieces of the long version, herself already. Bella wasn\u2019t just a simple blacksmith, no matter how often she described herself as one. Dwarves were rightly renowned for their skill at forging and metalwork, and Annabelle was the child of a long and highly-respected line.Even among her own people, Bella was considered a rare master of the art. Why she had chosen to live and work among the humans and other races instead of with her own people was a matter of much speculation, and little fact. Some insisted that she had fallen in love with a mortal man, others that she had committed some heinous crime and was exiled. A few wondered if she was a spy.For whatever reason, she was here now, and had been for many years. Even before the founding of Isra, Bella had been living in human cities for decades. Long enough to have adopted the habits, holidays, and customs of these lands. No trace of a dwarven accent or dialect remained in her speech, embracing the tongues of her adopted home with the same enthusiasm as everything else. In fact, she had assimilated as much as an outsider ever truly can.Since she had been here, though, Bella had established herself as one of, if not the single most skilled maker of weapons and armor in the area. It was whispered that any metal that so much as passed through her hands came back enchanted. It was utter nonsense, of course, but the magical nature of dwarven craft made it easy to understand where such talk came from.Socially, Isabella something of a butterfly. She had been seen in the company of a variety of people over the years, never staying with any one person or circle for very long. Far from the gruff and stoic stereotype of dwarves, Bella was friendly and outgoing and known to stay out drinking into the wee hours with the young bon vivant of the city. Somehow, she managed to do it while largely avoiding scandal or a reputation for jumping from bed to bed.Taking a slow sip of her tea, then leaning back slightly to address Genevieve, Bella lightly taps her fingers on the side of the cup. \u201cThe Forgeworks has been doing well in Isra these last few years.

She slid a hand to the back of her neck, the other perching on the round of her hip as she looked around the place, looking for anything that might be out of place or in disarray, but everything was perfect, spotless. There were no small hands to look at things, no small feet to run upstairs and make dust shake from the ceiling, no curious minds to both customers with questions.Her heart siezed in her chest and Genevieve closed her eyes, and took a deep breath to find her center. A small headache began to pound at the corner of her mind, as if the memories and emotions she shoved away day after day had come back to knock on her mental door.The door opened and Bella came out, half too-big and half too-small for the green gown.

The enchantress tapped at Bella's hands that held her bodice closed at the back, and her cool and gentle touch took over. Her blue-eyed gaze was on her work and with a few tugs, it seemed like the fabric expanded, enough that Genevieve could pin it at its back so it would stay up.Then, the golden-haired woman took to sitting on her knees at Bella's right, the faint scent of her perfume in the air and her attention on correcting the sleeves. \"Do you like the fabric?\" Genevieve asked. \"And the pattern?\"", "link_list": ["/user/2207"], "image_list": [], "html": "<span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-2207 group-0\" href=\"/user/2207\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@bella\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Annabelle \"Bella\" Khorudan</span></a></span>"}, "post-63364": {"user": "Lady Genevieve St. James", "user_num": 875, "timestamp": "1492667335000", "message": "Hope \"Not an Assassin\"No MERE thief.

While other merchants and traders and business owners might think that it's 'all business' and what a client does with the goods they sell after they've sold them held no bearing on them, Genevieve felt a little uneasy thinking that she might be aiding and abetting a talented thief with her charmed goods.She turned back to look at the man, who seemed to be of similar age to her.

I have never -- It has never happened,\" she hastened to say. Even though he did not seem to be particularly upset by this turn of events, she still felt as if her reputation was on the line.After all, she'd been in Isra for years (sort of) just as he had been and he'd never once darkened her doorway until now. That spoke of Fate, did it not? And now she had nothing, no wondrous item for him. Yet. Yet, she told herself. Of course, she had many fine things that he would look handsome and in-charge with, but to her knowledge, there was nothing that would call exactly to his soul.No clothing item, that is.\"Yes,\" she said as she transferred her bundle of clothes from her slender arms to his and gestured toward the handsome room in the back, a room as large and comfortable as a modest bedroom. Genevieve tried not to pace by his doorway as he changed, and tried not to pick at her fingers. What in the world? How could she not be prepared? Genevieve was always prepared.One thing she knew, was that she couldn't be found waiting two inches from the doorway. She forced herself to busy with inventory or something... something to get her attention off of disappointing the powerful man currently undressing himself in the bedroom. DRESSING ROOM. Dressing room.\"Genevieve, really,\" she scolded herself. Usually she was so composed and poised, but occasionally, she could find herself fluttered -- much like the birds that frequent her gardens at her estate outside of Fletcher.She shook her head and got to work, and Ryden came out every so often in a new change, trying on new trousers, or a vest, or a tunic, or a shirt. She'd come over to him when he did leave the dressing room and moved for the mirrors, seen at his side, her gaze on his chest or his arms and never really up to his face. She'd speak in that soft voice of hers, the Gauldish accent lilted on it, somehow making it even more feminine as she'd touch at a sleeve or a button or a fold and speak to him about it -- if he liked it, if he wanted it changed. Colors he preferred. Textures.And all the while she was like a ghost of velvet beside him. Sometimes close enough to his side or back that he might feel her warmth, sometimes she whispered away to pull out something different, and her perfume would linger behind to haunt the space she'd once been. It seemed that once Genevieve had slipped into her seamstress' stride she relaxed around him, no longer thinking of impressing him, or slipping up around him, or revealing more than she wanted to reveal but simply 'spoke shop.' Finally, when he was on his last change, she was crouched down at his booted feet, her gown a pool around her svelte body as she checked the length of a trouser and the small embellishment by the boot, her blue eyes concentrated and unaware of the way she bit her lip or lifted a slender hand to brush a whisp of golden hair from her face. \"Oui, I think that is it,\" she said to Ryden and smoothly came to stand again. She offered him an easy yet gentle smile. \"You can change into your things again, Chancellor,\" she told him as she ghosted away from him and toward the counter where they had piled what he would take today, what he did not prefer, and what he wanted with changes. \"I think I have a good idea of the exact perfect thing for you. In time for Prospernalia, of course,\" she said.

He had burst into her life with such suddenness, and everything the man did was constantly catching her off guard -- intense and rash. Genevieve was used to such calm, and although she knew that she was attractive, she was not at all used to the bold claims he made within minutes of making her acquaintance. It threw her off balance...... just as Ryden Greyiron did with his hot-and-cold game. She had no idea if she was attracted to the man. He was handsome, of course, and Genevieve was under the opinion that most women could be swayed to attraction with the right uniform and presence. The alpha male quality was one that Genevieve could be swayed to, just like any other woman, but did it run even deeper than that? As soon as she hit her stride as businesswoman and seamstress, she seemed to forget about his attractive qualities and focus on the task at hand. Even so, his politeness and the warmness of him -- and indeed, the flattering words he told her in a much more easy, silken manner than Hope had done -- had helped to make the enchantress comfortable.But his coldness in her store was not one she liked. It didn't occur to Genevieve that it might have been put into place because of Hope's presence. So when he spoke, she looked over her bare shoulder at him with an expression almost of blankness, her blue eyes just a little guarded.\"Make no effort to do so on my part, sil vous plait,\" she told him and turned to walk across her store and put the coins within her register. \"Just a moment, and I will have your Prospernalia outfit ready for you to try on, Chancellor,\" she said to him. Her voice was soft-spoken and polite as it usually was, but as he'd begun the visit with briskness, she continued it, her gaze on her hands and her business rather than on him.She put several bags on the counter, chic and fashionably with the name of the store on both sides of them up on the counter -- these were presumably the clothes he had already picked out previously that she had tailored and made to fit the lines and strength of his body. Then, the golden-haired woman moved to take another package into the dressing room, the heels of her boots quiet over the lush carpet of her store as she hung the shirt, the tunic, the jacket, the waist sash, the trousers up.Yet, as she was in the room, she felt that the walls were... uncomfortable. A chair within the handsome changing station was restless, creaking a little, shifting one of its legs closer to the lining of the wall. Genevieve frowned and lowered her hands from where she had arranged the Chancellor's outfit and moved toward the chair. Her hands drifted gently over its upholstery, its carved arms and legs and found nothing... but then her gaze caught the way the wallpaper seemed to gleam in its baroque designs, using the leaves and flowers as if to point to something.Genevieve went down to her knees by the wall, her velvet gown pooling around her... and nimble fingers found the ring that Hope had left in the wall.

She wasn't sure what to do with the ring, and slipped it into the subtle pocket of her velvet gown.With a breath, and a brush of her hand through the tendrils that frame her face, curling them back behind her ear and unconsciously putting another scent of her perfume in the air around her, she gestured toward the suit that hung in place. \"But Chancellor, this is what you have come for, non?\" she asked.The jacket was commanding, and austere. It was a midnight blue, accented with touches of black and a barely-lighter shade of navy. Silver and moonstone decorated down the chest of it, just enough to mark him as Someone Important, but not enough to make anyone think he was Trying Too Hard. Beneath the jacket was a machine vest, and a white silk shirt beneath that, edged with silver threading down its V that was meant to tie at his neck. A black-on-black design for the waist sash, and trimmed trousers.It was the outfit meant for a man in control, in charge, and a man who would go unquestioned. A man who did not need to be at the center of the attention, a man whose quiet power was understated -- until such a time that it needed to be wielded. The man who wore this spoke gently... yet carried a big stick.The enchantment woven into the silk of the garment was an enchantment of persuasion, and an enchantment of subordination. Those who stood near him would not only follow his orders, but feel comfortable to do so, convinced that what he spoke would be words of wisdom and words to live by.

It was no longer worth discussing the mysterious Rhean, though, so he answered her briefly, but not shortly. \"Perhaps, but I doubt it.\"After that, of course, it was back to business. Ryden idly noticed Genevieve reaching up to tidy the stray hair from across the front of her face, and he unconsciously matched the gesture, sweeping up one of the patches that had drifted down from its normal resting place. He caught the scent of her perfume, but it was of little importance once he saw the completed outfit, hanging on the rack. The outfit was a cut above what Ryden usually saw fit to dress in, both in terms of quality and style - but there was something more to it than just the workmanship that went into it. It called to him, in the manner which Genevieve had said it would, and the manner that they had searched for yesterday. All the same, he was glad to see the finished article, for it was he product of a master clothier and enchantress. \"\u00c7'est magnifique. Merveilleux. Parfait. Je vous remercie.\" It would suit him perfectly, of that he was sure. He trusted Genevieve in her garment-creating skill. Strangely enthralled, he reached out to touch it; ran his fingers through the material layers, enjoyed the peculiar buzz of magic he felt the soft silk and incredibly fine wool. It was fittingly august in nature, too - nothing was especially overt about it, yet it clearly showed good taste and wealth through simple, understated details, like the engravings on the silver fastenings, or the neat embroidery done in subtly different colours. Every little minuteae contributed to an expertly-made and entirely appropriate outfit for Ryden, except for the inevitable problem that it was just that - one outfit. That, however, was a problem Ryden could surmount momentarily \"As perfect as it is, I do have to pay for it. I'm afraid I didn't bring enough with me for it - I'm sure that you won't mind billing the Citadel, and I can get that sent to you as soon as possible. Thank you, Genevieve - thank you very much.

How would you care to join me for a meal, tomorrow evening, st the Moonlight Eclipse? We have yet to discuss a full wardrobe redesign I have planned.\"Despite throwing up a casual reason as a smokescreen, Ryden's tone and body language left no pretended that he was more interested in meeting her to discuss wardrobes, rather than that he had had an enjoyable time when speaking to her, and would quite like it to continue.

That you are too old for me? Do you think that I am a child and you would be taking advantage of my youthful innocence, perhaps? I am not old enough to decide for myself who I should like to spend my time with? Or is it simply the gentle excuse to let the vagabond with dreams above his station know that he is wasting his time?\u201dRaoul leaned on the counter across from Genevieve. His tone wasn\u2019t angry, but it wasn\u2019t as cheery as it had been, either. By all outward appearances, Raoul was being serious for a change, and laying his cards on the table in response to her doing the same. \u201cI agree that I am beneath you. There is not a single moment in your presence that I am not aware of it. I cannot imagine what you would want or expect from me except for perhaps the occasional bit of fun and to be gone before it created a scandal.\u201dHe paused again, then straightened with a small shrug. \u201cIf you enjoy me, I am here. I am happy to be as much a friend to you as a person of my rank and station can be to a person of yours. As much a friend as you will allow.
