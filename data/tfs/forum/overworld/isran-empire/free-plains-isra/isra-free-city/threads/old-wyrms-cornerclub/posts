It is now as reclusive as one might imagine, it is fairly open to the public. In fact, the place actively advertises itself upon the streets as 'a cheap tavern with strong beers, suitable to knock yourself out with', an attempt to drag in working class peoples, and adventurers of any kind.Two floors exist. The first floor is the largest area, with the second floor being far smaller, serving a more specialised purpose. The building is supported with oak, aged and brittle. No windows can be seen, giving the place a sense of mystique. Across the long, flat wall of oak where the windows should reside, instead depicts an image of a dragon smoking a pipe, with large red, ornate letters behind it reading 'The Old Wyrm's Cornerclub'. 'The' is replaced by the thorn letter, appearing as if it read out as 'Ye Old Wyrm's Cornerclub'.The interior is simple, typical of a bar. It is square, with the end being tapered off and extended, creating a rectangular room. Spigots line the wall, carrying with them numerous types of beers and spirits. A single larger spigot is in the centre of the aforementioned wall, carrying the words 'Dragon's Drink' in bold, red letters, the same cursive as used outside. The alcoholic beverage is rumoured to be immensely strong, drinking more then a tenth of a cup could knock you out, or leave you stuck incapacitated for the rest of your life.\u00a0The room possesses a low-ceiling, with overhead creaking beams threatening to fall at any moment. The roof sags slightly, but nigh unnoticeable. A keen eye would most likely feel unsafe is they spotted this structural flaw. Rounded tables, designed to allow as much people as possible dot the room, placed with no real idea in mind, creating a dense forest of tables and chairs. Skillful waiters have difficulty navigating the haphazard placements, darting between tables with great skill and finesse, despite their impediments.\u00a0A door lays to the side of the room. The door is locked and one would have trouble breaching the door using conventional methods. Only the rose emblem may remove the lock. This place is reserved for the elite, the pyromancers of the Inferno Assembly, as well as Attla himself. If one were to pass these doors and make it to the room above, they would be very much surprised. Above lays a red lounge, expensive velvet lining the walls. Red banners would hang from the wall, draping themselves out in order to clearly impose their authority. This area exists as a place for private discussions and conversations within the Inferno Assembly and whoever may wish to join their ranks.To join the Inferno Assembly, one must be approached by a certain denizen of the bar. This man would appear as any normal man, and is unidentifiable from the crowd. However, once you are approached by him, he will outstretch a job offer. If you accept it, you will be immediately grabbed and escorted to the above lounge, where you will be questioned to join a 'secret organisation'. If you decline, you shall be immediately subdued and through use of alchemy, be forced to forget the last day of information and thrown to the street. If you accept, you will be readily invited into the organisation, and you shall be prepared in order to be 'touched by the flame'.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The Old Wyrm's Cornerclub is the secret establishment of the Inferno Assembly, serving as a place to draw in possible recruits, attempting to hide in plain sight.

The Inferno Assembly, spied this mage's unique skill set during the tournament. They had taken a close-eye of the tournament, noting various competitors that may be of use to them. Solvictus of course stood out most prominently. The usage of dark magic greatly interested the Inferno Assembly, for it appeared immensely powerful, as well as the fact it did not look commonly practiced. Therefore, they reasoned that if they acquired Solvictus, he could be something of a secret weapon, a back-up plan. They also wished to study his magic, perhaps to fuse it with pyromancy in a seperate discipline.The sharp, buttoned, red suit would tell you of the Assembly pyromancer. The man strode from his position upon the far, barroom wall and would immediately beeline towards Solvictus, gesturing towards the locked door to the side of the Cornerclub. He was strictly professional, brisk and revealed no emotion. Reaching the door, his hand snaked into his breast-pocket, revealing the emblem needed for entry to the upstairs lounge. The door would jolt open and the man would step through, closing the door behind him as he went, making sure to let Solvictus through as he did so. The closing of the door would cause an audible click, signalling the numerous magical wards re-activating. He ushered Solvictus towards the stairs, gliding up the steps, his gloved hand sliding across the well-oiled railing of the stairs.\u00a0The lounge had already been prepared beforehand. Wines, cheeses, olives, grapes, all manner of luxuries had been laid out, upon the ornate long-table of the upstairs lounge. They did not know if Solvictus wished to eat the food, or if he was even capable of doing so. The Assembly still prepared the food anyhow, to appear polite, honouring his visit. It was key they were to persuade him to join the Assembly, therefore such measures had to be taken.Entering the room, you could spot two, far older, pyromancers upon a carmine couch near the back of the room, next to the window. They wore different clothing to thr younger pyromancer before, their uniform a richer shade of red, almost velvety. If Solvictus was there, the duo would nod towards him, and the leftward pyromancer would outstretch a hand towards the couch opposite, telling him to take a seat. These two couches were on toe sides of the lounge table of the lounge, dividing the two parties. By this point the younger pyromancer had already left the room, moving to his previous spot downstairs.The rightward pyromancer cleared his throat, and begun to speak. He spoke with a smooth tongue, emphasising cordiality.\"So, let us begin.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "They had seen Solvictus beforehand.

Runes of death, flame, electricity, ice; enough pent-up magical energy to murder a dragon. The threat was not empty, if Solvictus was to deny the request, he would be obliterated from the face of Isra. It was clear, Solvictus had to make a choice. With only one answer, if he was not a fool. Another click dispelled the display, changing the surroundings to as it was a few seconds prior.One of the duo curled his lip and licked his lips; as if he was tasting the air, like a snake. He just could not wait for what he might get from this. The high priest would be immensely pleased. The bountiful rewards he was to get would be simply delectable. Money was all that mattered to him, much like his other 'collegues'. He was sure the monetary gains from this would be monstrous. He was rich, yes, but getting richer was much more fun than just being rich. He could not be content with just that.However, he still has a job to do. He still has to let the contract run its course, before he may reap the benefits. He assumed a serious, professional face, dropping his emotion like a rock down a mine-shaft. He radiated coldness, a more lethal, professional air.The cordiality had dropped out of the voices of the duo by now. Stone-cold, they continued talking. All emotion evaporated from their faces; it was time to speak business.
