Located near the heart of the city and accessible to all, regardless of their social status or means, the library stands as a beacon for all those who treasure wisdom. In front of the library, just beside a small flight of stone stairs leading up to the sturdy wooden double-doors is a large sign board that often bears messages from the library itself and the government as a whole. These stairs are flanked by a pair of griffin statues, and the doors are crowned by a large stained glass window taking the shape of Isra\u2019s own golden sun insignia.Upon opening the doors, one would find themselves greeted with a quaint foyer, and beyond that, a small hallway. At the end of this hallway are two bookcases, and beyond that, the circulation desk, a large circular counter within the heart of the library. This desk is where a library card can be acquired, where materials can be checked out and returned, and where any questions can be posed or assistance requested. Resting on the side of the desk closest to the entrance is a sizeable bronze plaque which details the rules of the library. The rules are as follows:-- All are allowed entry into the library, with no discrimination against social status, means, race, or any other quality.-- All patrons are permitted to read books within the library without being required to check them out.-- Those wishing to remove materials from the premises must first acquire a library card.-- Please be courteous to your fellow patrons and maintain quiet at all times.-- Any damage done to the materials or the premises will incur fines.Moving closer to the center of this great room, it would become possible to look up, granting an unimpeded view of several stories of circular floors, each filled with countless bookcases and the books that fill their shelves, their edges safely warded off by sturdy stone and wood railings. These levels are reached by a staircase on the northern and southern side of each story, providing ease of access. Five levels in total lead upward to a graceful domed ceiling painted with a pleasant scene of clouds and sky, enchanted to reflect the current weather within the city, and scattered with skylights that allow natural sunlight to stream into the building. This light is augmented by many chandeliers and sconces bearing golden crystals, which glow with a pleasant light and sufficiently illuminate the interior of the building.The stone floors are covered here and there by many sturdy patterned rugs, and there are many small alcoves located in various places on every level, each with a small table and a few chairs and comfortable cushions for ease of reading and study. Small crystals attached to each table can be touched to summon one of the library\u2019s many scribes or assistants, to request help finding a certain book, or to request that something from a book be copied for personal use. These scribes and others are often employees of the library, paid to transcribe books among other tasks, although some of them are also simply there for the joy of learning and providing educational materials for others.On the first floor, to the west and east are two doors: The western one is labeled clearly as being for library staff only. The eastern states clearly in gold lettering the single word \u2018Amphitheater\u2019. Going through this door will lead one down a hallway to the room in question, a large hall with hundreds of seats, available for musical performances, lectures, instructional seminars, etc. To schedule any events taking place in the Amphitheater, one should speak to the Head Librarian.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "A towering edifice of stone and elegant arched windows, the Library of Isra is an extraordinary example of what a dedication to the dissemination of knowledge can truly achieve.

Despite the weather, she had spring in her step, in more ways than one. Her coat was matte brown with a tuft of white fur lining the collar. Her shoulders and her front were glazed by the gently falling snow, alluding to the fact that she had been walking with more or less a brisk pace. She tapped the desk with her index finger determinately. This was her first time to the library, despite knowing of it's construction months before it's completion. She spent much more of her time on the theory of her craft and read late into the night on various subjects she never had the time to delve into before. Her own collection of books had grown quite vast, which was part of the reason she took her time, but she felt like having access to the largest collection on the city wasn't the worst plan B. That's why she was here today, to make sure her plan was... properly stocked, so to speak.\"Excuse me,\" she asked, and drew a few heaving breaths, her shoulders rising and lowering while the snow trickled down her sleeves.

Imperial guards were obnoxious but not quite a deal-breaker, and this Shimmers fellow was not unfamiliar. He couldn\u2019t help but agree with Ms. Blythe, though. Those transportation carriages tended to be well guarded, and he lacked the supplies and connections to make that any easier on the group. Woe was the thief, too poor in coin to steal and too rich in spirit to beg. The gems in that hand would make him rich in both. He wanted to step forward as well, to swipe the diamonds and jump off of the roof while he still had his dignity, but that was a dream that he knew would end in failure. His mental calculations told him that the money was enough to get him far. Supplies, connections, food\u2026 He might be able to make something of himself. So when Foxgloves turned to him, he just smiled. \u201cUnderstood,\u201d he said, \u201cMy mouth is staying shut and my trousers are staying on. I\u2019ll do the best I can.\u201d His stomach churned when he spoke, but getting out of this alive was more important than saving his ego. That could be saved for later, when the job was actually done.

Turning back to Fiona, he cocked his head to the side like a curious pigeon, contemplating her for a moment before speaking.\"Is it really a prison break if the target isn't in a prison?\" he asked. \"Kind of an odd term for it, don't you think? It will be dangerous, of course. That's why I hired professionals. If I just needed a sweet roll stolen from a street vendor, I could have saved myself a small fortune in diamonds and hired some thug in a bar. You people aren't the sort of folk I can just hire in a bar...well, for this sort of work, anyways. In any case, what you do with the guards is up to you. I won't tell you how to do your job. It's up to your discretion as professionals. Still, it will be a difficult job, so I suppose I could offer you a hand.\"Reaching into his pocket once more, he pulled out a pale severed hand, which grasped at his fingers as he lifted it up. He touched the tip of the hand's index finger with his own, and it relaxed its frantic motions. It hopped out of his open glove and onto the ground, scuttling up to Fiona and crawling up her leg like an oversized spider.\"Its name is Sinestri,\" said Foxgloves, eyeing the creature as it clambered its way up Fiona's thigh and tried to nestle itself into one of her pockets. \"It's a pet of mine, I believe you'll find it quite useful. Please try to return it in good shape, I've grown quite fond of it.\"As for you, Azra'il dear,\" he said, turning his attention to the dark monk, \"You would be correct. You three had best get going now. But oh, I couldn't let you go without giving you a gift as well. Let's see...what might you find useful? You certainly seem to be well-prepared as it is...oh, but I have the perfect thing.\"This time, he produced a long black candle from his pocket, the wick a rather sickly shade of yellow. He handed it to Azra'il upside-down, with the wick pointing towards the ground.\"This is how it's meant to be burned,\" he said, giving the candle a little wiggle to emphasize its orientation. \"Make sure you remember that. I'm sure you'll find some use for it. Eldnacs are really quite difficult to come by these days. Now then, the three of you...you'd best be off. Good luck, and please try to bring our dear Mr. Shimmers back in one piece. Failing that, make sure he at least has his hands and eyes. He needs those to work.
