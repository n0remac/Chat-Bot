A very peculiar tailoring shop ran by two bees; Casey and Penny. The shop open to all who step foot in need of new clothing. The brick two story building is cozy but large enough to run a shop out of. On the outside, hangs the shops sign, Busy Bees' Clothing and Attire for All Occasions. The name can be quite long but it explains exactly what they do. The two bees often call it Busy Bees' for short. The first floor of the shop is divided into the store front where mannequins are set up with clothing for sale. To a room next to the store front, is an open sewing room and storage room. Within that room, customers are able to come in and request any clothing be made if they don't see anything in the store front. Looking in, passerby can see the array of mannequins. The shop has a cozy and inviting feeling and likewise are the shopkeepers. The two bees will work their little feet off to make the perfect garment, robe, and whatever ,whoever steps through those door, desires.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/507758551821975583/696464661486239774/a8d4f85d115aa5fe249c9a23f61e5149.png?width=535&height=401"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/507758551821975583/696464661486239774/a8d4f85d115aa5fe249c9a23f61e5149.png?width=535&amp;height=401\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}}
