Behind the oaken doors lies a level of luxury which previously, all but kings could hardly even dream of. Now, this opulence is available to everyone, regardless of their class. Provided, of course, that they can pay.The interior is tastefully done up with plush rugs and polished elder wood panels; the dim light coming from ornate chandeliers creates an air of mystique and allure. A framed painting of the establishment\u2019s benefactor, Calico Swartz  , prominently adorns the mantle above the fireplace, joined on both sides by other works of art by none other than the up and coming artist Raulio Fletcher  .One can enjoy their time here in comfort and privacy, for every booth, chair, couch, and armchair is masterfully designed and upholstered, and each is outfitted with runes of silence to ensure private conversations stay that way. The cuisine and liquor are of the highest quality; the kitchen and bar staff are rigorously trained and dedicated to ensuring that each gastronomic experience inside the Eclipse is one of the finest in your life. There is always some form of fantastic entertainment in the main hall of the Eclipse. Musical arrangements, singing, dancing, \u2018dancing\u2019, poetry readings, and even occasionally plays grace the stage. Well-funded and put on by only the most skilled artists, the shows here are truly something to behold. Such illustrious focuses need equally magnificent wait staff to attend to their audience, and the charismatic men and women of the Eclipse are more than qualified. The gentlemen are sharply dressed in well-tailored suits, the ladies sport elegant dresses, and all provide a charming appeal and a friendly face to strike up conversations with as they take your food orders or see to one of your other needs. Anyone who\u2019s anyone knows that money isn\u2019t all there is in life, however. For those privileged few with an invitation, a hidden door conceals a staircase down to the VIP section, where one can access special services without the prying eyes of society to judge them - should they choose to partake in them. Anything from exotic dancing to addictive substances, all the way and whatever is between the two, it won\u2019t be frowned upon here. Of course, should one choose to have none of that and simply enjoy the company of another in peace and quiet, then they have the freedom to do so. It\u2019s quite difficult to do anything at The Moonlight Eclipse and not enjoy one\u2019s self.

Big statues of cobras everywhere, and every street and alley is crowded with stalls like a bazaar. They value trade like it's a god, but they detest trading with anything that's not theirs. They had the best rugs, covered in beautiful designs and really soft. They use the rugs to sleep on, for their scales. They can make do on any surface, but they really like the rugs. Maybe it keeps them warm.\"Kematian stopped in thought, and remembered that his intent was to describe the city and its grand temple. \"Oh, yeah! So they took me to the edge of the city -- the whole city was like a big, carved-out area, you see -- and on that wall the entire thing was carved, ceiling to floor. They said it was a history of their city since it began, and you can see how things have changed, even in the carving styles. But the main doorway, it was a very, very big carving of a pit viper. Its eyes had these big pieces of jet in them, and it could stare you to death if you looked at it too long. Inside the temple was a big worship area with carvings of snakes all around. At the end of the room were different gemstones on pedestals--\" he held up his hands about three feet apart \"-- this far across and as tall as me. The stones were all shaped like different snakes, sort of like your art.\"But the grandest part was the altar. There's a door, right, made of stone, with the image of their snake-god carved on it.\" He leaned closer to her with a conspiratorial look and at just over a whisper, he added, \"It has six arms!\" Hoping he had achieved the proper dramatic effect, he leaned back again in his chair. \"So the main altar had the biggest carving you've ever seen. It was a snake statue that was bigger than this room, made only of precious stones and gold. Its head was probably... probably the size of your store counter! There was a high priest in there with a ceremonial dagger, talking to it, when he was interrupted by the snakes who found me -- I found out they were his special aides. They explained the whole thing, and then the high priest got really excited and asked to look at the emerald, so I gave it to him, and then he put it on the snake, right in its right eye. Turned out that was the last piece, and after it was put together, it came to life and started talking in this other language, but I could understand it. It was thanking me, and then it told me I was welcome among all the tribes of snakes and lizards forever. And from then on, even when I was in the mountains, lizard-highwaymen would leave me alone even when orcs wouldn't. It was really cool.\"Kematian realized he had talked little about the city itself, and only his first visit there. He has clearly gone on for too long, now. He blushed and looked down, embarrassed. \"And the city was also very beautiful. Which is what I meant to say all along.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Kematian was all too thrilled to recount the tale of his favorite place, though Moon seemed distracted. It was probably just the atmosphere. It is a strange place, this city... Then the odor of the cigarette finally wafted to him and he understood just what the atmosphere was. Oh, well. It wasn't like the toxic fumes of Al-Ankthrazk.

My return.)Kematian could tell Moon was having fun hearing about the tale, and that was what mattered. He was glad someone enjoyed that whole situation. It really only paid off when no reptiles bothered him again... Except dragons. They apparently weren't under that deity's jurisdiction.He tilted his head and tried to visualize the dragon as she described it. A dragon and its hoard was something he had never really seen before; though he had observed it at its early stages, he tended to take the dragon's gold long before it accumulated to such an extent. That dragon must have been collecting since before any human kingdom rose out of the dust. He nodded at the end, agreeing that it was tragic to see that in its old age, greed had literally closed its eyes to the universe. And then she did that face-reddening again. It happened a lot, but she liked being around him, so maybe that was a natural reaction?\"Well, like I said, it still is an adventure to me to live like 'normal' humans do.\" He looked away and knitted his eyebrows, a little confused. \"So I think the answer to that question is both...?\" And then he did it again. He turned the question back to her face like a mirror, asking, \"What about you?

He informed them that he was be returning just as soon as he finished ferrying out the bizarre platter and that if so much as even a single grape was out of place that there would be severe consequences.Then, with plate in hand, Maelik opened the door and took his first step out on the floor.

Oh well, a step in the right direction is always welcomed in his eyes, especially when it made things easier.With proper haste he hurried the plate off to the nobleman and gracefully slide it up the length of his one arm, over his shoulders and down the other to showily spin into place in front of the customer.\"Enjoy your meal sir, if you have any complaints with the food please let the nearest server know and I'll be happy to see to the issue.\" Maelik's deep, terrifying voice was about as jovial as it could be but if that prissy noble knew what was good for him it would be best to not make a stink about anything.

It wasn't entirely clear what it was that he said but the waitress's skin turned three shades more pale and her eyes grew wide, the pupils incredibly dilated. At almost the total opposite end of the spectrum Maelik seemed completely at ease, a small smile snaking its way up on his face as he whispered the last few words and turned her around, lightly slapping her rear in order to push her along her way.Good. Clientele such as this should only be seen to by the best. And of course, in Maelik's not so humble opinion there was nobody better suited for it than himself.Like a great black tide he rolled into view of the booth and graced the table with one of his massive fang filled grins, his polished armor glistening in the mood lightening and giving it otherwise ebony sheen a myriad of colors.\"Greetings and salutations Madame, it's always fantastic to lay eyes on you.

The demon washed his limbs as he always did and turned his attention to the counter tops, their shining clean surface reflecting his grim business face.Pristine, just the way he liked it.He snapped his fingers and the assembled chefs scurried away to return to whatever work they were meant to be doing, allowing for the beastly creature to go about his way without any interruptions or gawking youngsters getting under his feet.His tail shot out and deftly flicked a knife out of a nearby holder, the flashing silver blade turning end over end only to fly straight into the cutting board that Maelik lifted up from the counter to intercept it. He tore the shining shank free from its prison and resharpened it to a wicked edge before getting busy with peeling all the vegetables.The skin from the baby carrots went twirling off in spirals to gracefully land in a conveniently placed waste bin as did the skin from the sweet potatoes that shortly followed, although the cauliflower was spared, mostly because one simply did not peel a cauliflower.Poros's hare was a simple matter for Maelik, it helped that the man knew specifically how he wanted it done, saved the demon from having to make an assumption. That and he welcomed any excuse to use the grill.So with great care Maelik grabbed a still bleeding rabbit from his hell portal of wonders/horrors and set to skinning it. Forgoing the more comfortable method of cleaning the less-than-lively Thumper the demonic chef chose to employ a set of thin tongs (they may as well have been tweezers) and daintily removed the organs via oral/rectal insertions and foraging.With the hare in good shape Maelik put it on the back-burner in the metaphorical sense and used his wings to rub in oils and seasoning salts whilst his hands rewashed and moved onto Naoki's center piece.Given her preferences he chose to go with cockatrice breast, and one that was decidedly not beaten to death to preserve the integrity of the meat... three men and a goat will forever be remembered for their brave sacrifice for the sake of quality.Maelik buttered up a pan and added in a lemon before laying the breast down smack dab in the middle. He struggled with the decision on what heat setting to leave it on but eventually settled with 'purple' before once again snapping his clawed fingers (a notable feat considering he was wearing gauntlets) and changing the hue of the flickering orange flame to a regal magenta.Now he turned his attention back to the hare, opening up the grill and spitting out a demonic flame to get the heat going. In this case however he'd have to refrain from going all out with the fires as Poros was very clear with his instructions and Maelik would be damned if he was going to disappoint the man, so he forced his will on the rising wisps and subdued them to a more manageable level. The rabbit itself was already thoroughly seasoned with the appropriate spices for the season and a caramel infused sauce was vigorously massaged into the haunches, something that the demon held supreme faith in in terms of taste.He placed it down on the wide barred grill evenly and kept a close eye on the level of the fire to make sure that it wasn't going to char anything and cook the meat through and through. However he couldn't just ignore the cockatrice either and changed to stove flames from purple to green before turning the thing over, replacing the lemon as he did such.Within moments both the cockatrice and the rabbit were ready for serving, the outer layer of the hare crispy just as Poros had requested and the cockatrice breast infused with the slight tang of lemon. He added in the baby carrots (each one individually buttered and pan cooked), some mashed potatoes and of course the ever uncut cauliflower, lightly sprinkled with sea salt and boiled in his patented iron hot box.He popped back out of the kitchen with platters in hand and with a showboat-y flair he tossed them like throwing discs and guided them down with magic to land perfectly in front of their respective recipients, a third platter floating down to greet Artemis as well, this one of course being a carbon copy of Naoki's meal. One of these days he's going to have to corner her and get the scoop on what exactly she liked for occasions such as this.\"Sorry for the wait ladies and gentleman, I hope that you enjoy,\" he said before taking a half step back and dipping down into another grandiose bow, the horn at the tip of his snout scratching unpleasantly against the floorboards.Most would assume that he'd take his leave then but for any who knew the excessively uptight demon they'd know that he was was liable to stick around to witness the newcomer's face upon tasting his food. And that was exactly what he did, merely taking yet another half step back before standing at rigid attention, practically staring a hole straight through the man.He was absolutely dying to see what the man had to say about his dish!", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "(Sorry for the wait, had some issues to attend to.)"}, "post-27726": {"user": "Poros Welchion", "user_num": 1106, "timestamp": "1457454601000", "message": "Poros laughed, \"No ma'am, one triple brew will not take me down so easily.\"He leaned forward a bit. His hands often resting on the table when he wasn't speaking, as if he wanted to show he had nothing to hide.The waiter returned with a beautiful mug, like something that would be won at a big competition. When he first lifted the mug he realized the one he had asked was probably more like two and a half. This mug was massive. Then again, the shiny bits could have been silver which would explain some of the weight.He took a few big swigs, put the mug down and leaned his head backwards. \"Oh yeah, that's the stuff...\"The alcohol quickly finding its way to his brain, only a slight numbness remaining. That was all he really needed.He turned his head to the waiter who was still there.\"Excellent brew, a fine choice, sir, thank you!\" He smiled.\"I don't know that much about politics and I have no intention of angering you in any way, Naoki. So I haven't really got a clue what to talk about right now. I could act like this is a date and talk about music, arts and how amazing I like to think I am, but then... With two of you here it is hard to imagine this dinner as one.\"He thought for a second and took another few swigs of the drink. \"That or it is the greatest opportunity yet.\" He laughed, very genuine, then stopped laughing by forcefully closing his mouth. His left hand making a gesture as to apologize for that comment.\"I'm sorry, I have never had a business dinner where a certain someone wasn't trying to win over the other party and I was just there for the numbers. Please forgive my comment, rudeness and inability.\" That's quite strong, the ale is. Even for a triple brew. He was okay now, but understood Naoki's comment from before. Better get a good night's sleep after this.The figure of Maelik appeared out of the kitchen, quite happy with himself apparently. Plates flying towards Poros and his dinner companions. That in itself was not special, the fact they landed perfectly in front of everyone and the food didn't look shaky was incredible. Magic, Poros thought. Still, a great experience. This chef wasn't here the last time he had dinner in the Eclipse, the food was good then but Naoki seemed to think Maelik was much better.\"May I say, a grand presentation for the food, sir Maelik, it looks fantastic!\" His fear of the draconic figure seemed to have faded a little.Poros took the utensils, put his hands together and murmured a small text then dug in. The carrots were first to get tasted. It was quite ironic to serve hare with carrots, Maelik has a sense of humor, I give him that. They tasted quite good, much better than any other carrot he had ever tasted. a small sound of approval escaped Poros' mouth. He looked over to the plates of the ladies. What they were having looked great too. This Maelik fellow really knew how to-.Maelik was just staring at Poros, attentively. Like he was following every move he made. Their eyes crossed and Poros stared back, for still half in his mouth. Did he realize why I let him turn around for me? Slowly but surely fear began creeping up Poros' spine again.Can he read minds? Maybe he could and he had noticed the things he said about Naoki and Artemis. Oh no! Wait... Shake your head if you can read my mind right now... Poros squinted his eyes, trying to see what the draconic figure did.In the meantime he thought he would try the cauliflower, if Maelik couldn't read minds this would seem quite silly. Poros never was afan of cauliflower, but this was tasty. He understood why Naoki praised his cooking.Two more, Poros thought. The mashed potatoes were very creamy. No crust so very fresh as well. Then over to the best part, or so Poros hoped. He cut a small piece of the rabbit, or tried to. The meat was so strong and fresh he ended up having a strip of meat of one of the haunches.Poros was still trying to keep an eye onto Maelik, in case he shook his head. What is this? The meat tasted so good. They say no - one can cook as well as your grandma. But apparently the stuff of nightmares can do it better. His eyes turned away and he let out a very uncharming moan, which is not something appropriate for the occasion.\"Oh god, this is so good! I mean, I wanted to eat hare, but I had no idea I wanted it this badly.\" He smiled in the direction of Naoki, not the same smile anymore. If anything, she had taken very good care of him today. The food had also changed his mood slightly. There was no reason not to go all in with is offer. Later... Right now he had some eating to do.Maelik was still staring, and even though it was creepy, all he could really do was take another swig of the beer and then turn towards him.\"If you were a waiter, I would have you send my compliments to the chef. But since you are here, I must say the only thing that I know of that surpasses how positively scary you look, is your ability to take a rabbit and create a masterpiece.\"Enough talking, there was glorious food to eat.

You\u2019d like opportunities to broker peace and protect innocents, and I think that I can provide those.

Those sorts of situations are rarer than they really should be. The \u2018protecting the innocents\u2019 and \u2018stopping evil\u2019 are much more practically achievable goals, in my mind.  \u201cYou\u2019re not going to see me inciting any wars, killing things for no valid reason, or asking you to in my stead. That\u2019s not my style. If I want something done, I want it done for a valid reason, that either expands my ability to get things done, improves the world I\u2019m living in, or protects those I care about. Every action I\u2019ve taken or ordered up until this point generally falls into one of those broad categories, and those are my primary considerations at all times. Never will I ever when dealing with you, nor have I ever, when dealing with other associates, ask you to do something I know you\u2019ll find distasteful, or force you into taking actions you find reprehensible.

People do what I ask them to because they know I\u2019m asking for a valid reason, and trust me and my ability to decide what needs to be done, and by whom. If you ever have an objection to something I ask you to do, all you need to do is voice it.\u201d\u201cWith that in said, I\u2019m probably going to ask you to sometimes do tasks that aren\u2019t directly related to one of your three stated goals, but rather one of my own. I think that\u2019s probably reasonably fair, considering that this is to be a two way street, and our goals really aren\u2019t quite that different.\u201d \u201cThe gold is trivial, I could afford to pay you ten times that amount and not bat an eye. As for the shield, I\u2019m willing to offer you any of the ones in my armories, but none of them are particularly special, to be honest. However, I am willing to cover the cost of one you might find for sale, or assist you in locating and acquiring one through other means. Further, as it turns out, there is a master smith over at The Sun right now, and I\u2019m currently in the process of constructing one of the largest and most expansive equipment creation facilities to my knowledge. If you can\u2019t find what you\u2019re looking for now, once it is operational and staffed, you\u2019ll be able to have whatever you please commissioned there. Beyond that, continuing forward with payment into the future, I\u2019m willing to essentially use all means available to me to assist you in acquiring whatever it is that you might need within reason, as long as you\u2019re willing to put in every reasonable effort to assist me in whatever manner you can.

What\u2019s one more, especially when they\u2019re as cute as you?\u201dNaoki shoots Jun a single flirtatious wink before abruptly turning away to signal to some attendant beyond the curtains. A few moments later, the elven attendant returns, this time with a pair of lapdesks, ink, quills, and enough parchment for Naoki to begin drafting the necessary documentation. They contain all of the aforementioned terms and agreements, as well as some other basic, obvious things, such as Jun agreeing not to disclose any information that is made available to her through her high security clearance. With a quill in her right hand and glass of wine in her left, Naoki proceeds to alternate paragraphs of writing with consulting Jun for her input and sips of wine, the glass rising to full lips in a manner that turns the mundane action into something almost suggestive. The process doesn\u2019t take too terribly long, and before long, a set of agreements suitable to both parties are completed and presumably signed. With the documents handled, and her last signature signed, Naoki tosses the quill onto the table with an air of finality. \u201cThere we are, all finished.\u201d\u201cUnrelated subject.

Social influence is one of the largest tools in Naoki\u2019s arsenal; she wields the great Sword of Conformity with all of the wit and skill of a master sabreur, leading her companion along, influencing them to take actions that lead into an advantageous position for Naoki.\u00a0\u201cTo be honest, I did the same thing, shortly after concluding the deal that resulted in this establishment.

Then, afterwards, depending on how well the business goes, and what I think of the individual\u2026 Well. Like I mentioned, Mr. Swartz left that day satisfied in more ways than one.\u201d Instead of following that statement up with laughter, Naoki chooses this moment to make her move. Around the table she slinks, using the pillow she\u2019s sitting on as a sort of sled to slide around the couch, stopping just short of Jun\u2019s thigh, where she gingerly places the palm of her hand. She bows her head slightly to make eye contact with Jun, and intones with her best sensual tone, \u201cI think that our negotiations went quite well, and I consider you with very high esteem.

Though it does jiggle slightly, there is no sign of consciousness. \u201c... Dammit, Jun.\u201d\u201cWhat am I supposed to do about\u2026?!\u201d In a great huff, Naoki stands, revealing a small patch of slightly darker, slightly damp pillow where she had been sitting. She is not immune to anticipation, afterall. Abruptly, she wheels about, extending her arm to point sharply in a seemingly random direction behind the curtains. \u201cYou! Bring me the kit!\u201dThe curtains ruffle slightly, and the lithe form of the Elven waitress stands upright and moves from behind the curtain. Though she is clearly blushing in embarrassment of being so easily found out, she manages to stammer out a response, \u201cW-w-which kit, Madame?\u201dNaoki fixes her with an incredulous gaze. \u201cHow many kits do you have?\u201dThe elf begins to count on her fingers, \u201cWell, we have several toy kits, the leathers, the restraint kits for both male and fema-\u201dNaoki cuts her off, \u201cNonononono, not those! I mean the medical kit! The others- those are \u2018sets\u2019, \u2018costumes\u2019, and \u2018restraint equipment\u2019, respectively! Get your terminology straight, and get me the medical kit!\u201d\u201cY-yes Madame!\u201d The elf hurries off. Naoki considers the comatose form of Jun with an eye of disappointment and condescension. The nerve!... Passing out like that. Rude, is what it was. Naoki had wined her, she had dined her, and she had made a perfectly decent and respectful advance, and all Jun could do in response was to pass out! Not a polite but firm refusal, not an embarrassed but ultimately futile attempt at rebuttal, not even some soft murmur about how Jun thought she perceived her sexuality before Naoki\u2019s lips changed her mind!She just passed out! That\u2019s simply disrespectful!\u201cThe medical kit, Madame.\u201d The elf had returned, carrying an ornate wooden box with a brass latch on the front.Naoki turns and brusquely takes the box from her grip, before setting it down on one of the adjacent couches and, after undoing the latch, opening the lid. As the lid opens, layered trays fold outward, displaying their contents of what are presumably medical supplies. One tray gives host to a small collection of gemstones. Another, small vials of multicolored liquids. Some of the trays even hold traditional medical supplies, bandages and the like. The elf disappears behind the curtains, hoping to avoid further embarrassment. Naoki\u2019s eyes flicker between Jun\u2019s unconscious form and the options before her. First, Naoki pulls out  a small jar of some very viscous blue gel. A paralysis gel. Forcing Jun to ingest some of this would render her almost completely unable to move her muscles, disabling such things as the vocal cords and movement of the limbs, but leaving such crucial and instinctual things as the heartbeat, eye movement, and certain other physical responses intact. With this, it would be trivial for Naoki to impose her will upon Jun. She could be forced to watch helpless as Naoki has her way with her. As with all of the products in her kit, Naoki had personally tested this concoction with Artemis, and they both found it to be quite stimulating, no matter whether one was the paralyzer or the paralyzee.However, the gel would also leave Jun unable to reciprocate, and judging by the damp spot, Naoki finds this solution unacceptable. It would be sort of rapey besides, she admits. Not really the best for continued relations if Jun finds she doesn\u2019t agree with the premise, even if there is a great deal pleasure involved for her.Retiring the gel to its compartment, Naoki next considers a small vial of vaguely translucent lavender fluid. She knows this one all too well to be an aphrodisiac of the highest magnitude. Naoki remembers- just vaguely- the weekend that Artemis had decided to pair this with a stimulant of the same extreme effectiveness. A drop or two of this onto Jun\u2019s tongue, and instincts would surely prevail over reason, leading to hours upon hours of pleasure. To be completely honest, Naoki cannot help but admit that the lavender fluid seems pretty damn appealing. If only a few glasses of wine had done this to Jun, Naoki can only imagine, (to the detriment of the poor pillow), what a couple drops of this would inspire her to do. Leveraging Jun\u2019s low tolerances to Naoki\u2019s advantage in the best possible way would be a delicious irony\u2026 It would still be rather heavy-handed, though, and it would be readily apparent to Jun after the fact that she was drugged. Naoki sets the vial carefully down to one side on the table, shelving, but not discarding the option, and continues to consult the kit. A vial of shimmering gray liquid catches her eye next. This particular concoction was an interesting and rather widely applicable one. It fully removed the physical effects of intoxication, and replaced them with a more predictable suite of effects, partially emulating drunkenness, but also acting as an aphrodisiac. For people who were unaccustomed to being drunk, they often simply accepted it as the effects of alcohol. Jun\u2019s low tolerance did present an issue here; Naoki was unsure how much of a dose would be required, and alchemicals could be dangerous if overused. With a sigh, she replaces the vial into the kit. It wouldn\u2019t do to cripple Jun.A sweep of the eye confirms that none of the other concoctions would be relevant to this situation. Hmph. She would have to do this via more traditional means. Her mind whirs as she considers the tools at hand. Waking Jun up would be trivial, she had several methods to do that. The real challenge lay in the aftermath of that. She was confident in her ability to seduce if her mark was actually conscious, but a little insurance never hurt. There was always the lingering possibility that Jun considered herself exclusively heterosexual. An aphrodisiac should go quite a ways towards alleviating that pesky inhibition, but there was another weapon in her arsenal. A weapon that Jun trusted, with a feathered head. Turning it from a lesbian experience into a group experience would probably kill off any lingering doubts, and she could always have Artemis take a turn with Calico once Jun had succumbed. That would put him out like a light in short order.Pivoting on her pillow, the fabric sticking to her slightly as she does so, Naoki once again snaps, and levels a finger at the elf. \u201cYou! The candles!\u201d\u201cW-w-which candles, Madame?\u201dNaoki fixes the elven attendant with another gaze, this one somehow more incredulous than the last.  \u201cYou know full well which candles I mean, Aliya! The sexing candles!\u201d\u201cH-how many of them, Madame?\u201dNaoki simply tilts her head slightly to the side, a long-suffering expression on her face, and stares at the elf.\u201cO-of course, Madame!\u201d The elf bustles off, to return shortly, arms laden with portly red candles, and a small firestarter nestled in her bosom. She sets down the majority of the candles on the table, before taking the firestarter and the remainder of the candles and beginning to set them up and light them around the room. As she\u2019s doing so, Naoki proceeds to pack up the medical kit, leaving a few choice items on the table near her, but restoring the rest to their rightful place in the box, before closing it, latching it, and sliding it below the table.As the heady aroma of the candles begins to fill the room, Naoki regards Jun\u2019s sleeping form, drooling lightly on one of the pillows. Heat starts to build in Naoki\u2019s core - of two different types. If Jun, after Naoki went to this much trouble, denied her again\u2026 why\u2026 why, oh! The thought of it very nearly causes Naoki to do something rash. If such a future came to be, she likely very well would. Regardless, a few minutes and burned-elf-fingers later, Aliya is finished setting up the candles, and their aroma fully permeates the air. Naoki inhales deeply, places her palm on her left breast, still covered as it is by her dress, and trembles slightly at the mere contact. They\u2019re working.Once again, Naoki levels her pointed finger at Aliya, who is blushing furiously at this point and struggling to maintain her self control, clasping her hands in front of her in an attempt to keep them from wandering. Naoki\u2019s order is issued with absolute certainty, \u201cGo get Calico, and bring him down here. I don\u2019t care what he\u2019s doing; drag him by the feathers, if you must.\u201d\u201cY-yes Madame!\u201d Aliya moves swiftly from the room, still clasping her hands tightly together.. \u201cAnd hurry up, Aliya!\u201d \u201cY-esss, Madaaaame\u2026\u201d comes a shaky voice from beyond the door.Shortly thereafter, Aliya arrives before Calico in the lounge above, and curtsies slightly, as is probably appropriate. Though her face is still somewhat flushed, and one with a keen sense of smell may be able to discern the mixtures of scents that still cling to her, she manages to conduct herself with some semblance of elegant coherence. She intones quietly, \u201cMadame Naoki would like to see you in her den, Mr. Swartz. Immediately.\u201d", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\u201c...

From the small pile of supplies selected from the medical kit, she selects a small vinaigrette. White crystals sit silently in the lowermost portion of the bottle. Salt of hartshorn. At some unseen signal, the band playing in the lounge above changes their tune, somewhat abruptly. The Manasynth artist comes into the fullness of his element, beginning to belt out the smooth sort of rhythm that only he can.\u00a0Naoki attempts to carefully remove the cork, but after a few moments of struggling, finds herself unable. In frustration, she takes the cork into her mouth and yanks mighty, easily pulling it from the bottle.

Her countenance would be best described as a humorless mannequin with such a deep and profound apathy for life that being manhandled, dismembered and undismembered, groped and undressed while on public display, all meant absolutely nothing to her. Her face was so remarkably still that every single blink, every bat of an eyelash, had the gravity of a guillotine drop.A few seconds later Jun's frozen visage slowly rotated towards Naoki and gazed upon her swiveling tail. Her head cocked slightly and there was a distinct pop in her neck. She took a deep breath, leaned forward slightly, and carefully placed the tips of her fingers together while staring at the table in front of her like it was suddenly the most fascinating table she had ever seen in her life.Meanwhile, within the depths of her consciousness:Jun?No.... Jun?NO!... Jun, we should totally go for it....Jun?... How did I get here? What is this? What is my life? I'm being solicited for sex by a cat girl, and her body guard, and a bird man.... Jun?WHAT?... You have to admit, that's a really cute tail.Back in reality Jun's cement head would swivel slightly and gaze at the tail before returning to the table.Come on they are both really fucking cute! You already had sex with one of them!...You come from a clan of diplomats! You're supposed to be respectful of other cultures! What would father think if you-DON'T BRING MY DAD INTO THIS WHAT THE HELL IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?... All I'm saying, is there is nothing wrong with casual sex.And what about Vaelar? Hmm? HIS culture is monogamous. HE would not want me boinking three animal people.Two.... I'll bet Artemis is hiding, like, a shark fin somewhere, or something.At this point, should anyone attempt to interrupt Jun's inner dialogue, they'd be met by a swift and stern single dainty index finger, pointed straight up in the air, facing right at them, a tacit but no less harsh edict of silence.Oh, hey wassup.What, where did you come from?Hey other me, Jun is about to participate in an orgy.Sweet.NO I'M NOT!... It'll be good life experieeeence. *sing-song voice*Hey, I fought a titan, I have all the life experience I'll ever need.Jun, sweetheart, there is nothing wrong with breaking out of your shell, seeing the world and living life-I FOUGHT A FUCKING TITAN!Although Jun's face still hadn't changed in the last few seconds, assuming there were no anti-magic fields currently active, a small crack would appear in a nearby glass, to which Jun would idly gaze at before returning her attention to this most captivating of tables.Jun, Jun Jun all I'm saying is that you should be more open minded. Non-judgmental... I'll bet Lum'Valia would want you to do it.... I... cannot... even begin... to describe to you... what is wrong with that statement.Look... honestly, if your loyalty to Vaelar is that important, then I think you should follow your heart. Do what you want, or in this case, don't do what you don't want.Really? You mean that? What if it's bad for negotiations?It doesn't matter. You have every right to say no. That is a fact.... Ok, thank you....But, but... that tail though?! Think of the possibilities! The foreplay!...Suddenly, like a dead animal returning to life by means of mild electrical stimulation, Jun's face began to stir. Only a few seconds had elapsed since she had gone cold, and yet her deep sighing breath would imply an effort comparable to an hour-long diatribe about conservative values with a stubborn old man. However, it wasn't quite over yet. \"Madam Naoki, I... I..., would you excuse me for just... one second? Just a quick second... that's all.\"Assuming she were permitted to step outside the door, she would make her trek towards the door. Grave, ponderous strides would bring her past the fancy upholstery, past the gauzy blue fabric of the curtains, past the warm lamp lights, right to the door. She would step outside, close the door half way behind her, and then poke her head, accompanied by a raised index finger, back inside the door. \"Just one second. I promise.\" Finally she completed the action of actually stepping outside the door and closing it.Things would be relatively silent inside Naoki's room. A few more seconds would elapse until muffled, barely audible yelling and shouting would begin just outside.\"No, I'm fucking done. I'm fucking done. This is bullshit. This is, fucking bullshit... WHAT IS THIS?! WHAT IIIS THIIIS? *odd hybrid of laughter and sobbing* WHAT IS MY LIIIIIFE?! I can't do it. I can't! Grandma, I can't fucking do this.\" As if someone had given her words of comfort (though nothing else would be heard), Jun would then continue. \"I appreciate it... But look what we're dealing with here! You gotta draw the line somewhere. YOU GOTTA DRAW A FUCKING LINE IN THE SAND! We gotta make a statement. You gotta look inside yourself and say, 'what am I willing to put up with today?' NOT, FUCKING THIS!\"A few more seconds would go by before Jun once again re-entered the room. Her face seemed oddly serene. Once again, with ponderous footsteps, she walked past the warm lights, past the blue gauze curtain, past the fancy upholstery, and once again took her original place on the couch facing her beloved table.\"Madam Naoki... Calico, umm, well, first of all I think you guys are... amazing people, and... well I love you both. I absolutely am forever grateful at the chance to meeting with you two and, well, I really do look forward to working with you both. But, umm... Welp, I have a boyfriend.

Her countenance would be best described as a humorless mannequin with such a deep and profound apathy for life that being manhandled, dismembered and undismembered, groped and undressed while on public display, all meant absolutely nothing to her. Her face was so remarkably still that every single blink, every bat of an eyelash, had the gravity of a guillotine drop.<br><br/>A few seconds later Jun's frozen visage slowly rotated towards Naoki and gazed upon her swiveling tail. Her head cocked slightly and there was a distinct pop in her neck. She took a deep breath, leaned forward slightly, and carefully placed the tips of her fingers together while staring at the table in front of her like it was suddenly the most fascinating table she had ever seen in her life.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, within the depths of her consciousness:<br/><font color=\"8200a4\"><br/></font><i><font color=\"8200a4\">Jun?<br/>No.<br/>... Jun?<br/>NO!<br/>... Jun, we should totally go for it.<br/>...<br/>Jun?<br/>... How did I get here? What is this? What is my life? I'm being solicited for sex by a cat girl, and her body guard, and a bird man.<br/>... Jun?<br/>WHAT?<br/>... You have to admit, that's a really cute tail.</font><br/><br/></i>Back in reality Jun's cement head would swivel slightly and gaze at the tail before returning to the table.<i><br/><br/><font color=\"8200a4\">Come on they are both really fucking cute!

Hmm? HIS culture is monogamous. HE would not want me boinking three animal people.<br/>Two.<br/>... I'll bet Artemis is hiding, like, a shark fin somewhere, or something.</font></i><font color=\"8200a4\"><br/></font><br/>At this point, should anyone attempt to interrupt Jun's inner dialogue, they'd be met by a swift and stern single dainty index finger, pointed straight up in the air, facing right at them, a tacit but no less harsh edict of silence.<br/><font color=\"8200a4\"><i><br/>Oh, hey wassup.<br/>What, where did you come from?<br/>Hey other me, Jun is about to participate in an orgy.<br/>Sweet.<br/>NO I'M NOT!<br/>...

I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ve mentioned this to you, but I am Isra\u2019s Ambassador to Gauldin. As part of some pacts I\u2019ve forged, trade between the two nations is going to open in earnest very soon. I\u2019m talking massive volumes of intercontinental trade, on a scale hitherto unseen in this world. A serious logistical challenge I\u2019m enjoying solving. It\u2019s going to be exceptionally prosperous and excellent for all involved if everything goes smoothly, but there are a handful of factors that I\u2019m aware of, even now, that may interfere with operations.\u201d\u201cThe trade is going to be conducted both by Gauldin\u2019s merchant air navy, and traditional sailing ships either contracted by Isra or independent merchants. The plan is to route goods primarily through Carmella Island (which was recently annexed by Gauldin), and use it as a sort of midway staging point. I\u2019m going to have a road constructed from Isra to Carmella, and the idea would be to take things by cart, over land to Carmella, and then load the goods onto ships of some variety to get them the rest of the way to Gauldin. And the reverse to get goods from Gauldin to Isra; a two way street, as it were.\u201d\u201cMost of the logistical and infrastructural problems, I\u2019m already aware of and working to remedy though my own means. However, there are a number of other factors that I can\u2019t quite solve with industry and careful planning. Pirates, for one. But they can be deterred by force, and I\u2019m not really going to ask you to go around doing something as mundane as setting pirates aflame.

I don\u2019t have any firsthand information, but they say that those who harm the sea will incur \u2018her\u2019 wrath. Again, I\u2019m not really sure who \u2018she\u2019 is, what sort of being they might be, if they\u2019re sentient or not, or really anything beyond what I just told you.

Raynor was content to remain in furs. Jun wore a formal suit typical of Isranian fasion.Elder Havador himself marvelled at the intricate craftsmanship of the chateau and its trappings. At the same time he admitted he found the city of Isra to be somewhat suffocating. There were so many people in one place, along with a distinct lack of green. Jun assured the Elder that it would take some time to get used to it, but that for the most part people were friendly and welcoming towards outsiders.Two more guests accompanied them: Esejef, leader of the Sodalite Clan, and Alanis Waterbloom, a representative of the elves of the Land-Tillers. They appeared calm and serene. In fact they hardly spoke at all. They took measured steps, as if meditating while walking. Alanis wore a green suit, and Esejef clean tan robes with a white sash around his neck.Havador noted Lady Naoki in deep discussion with Nyx and Tristian on the other side of the room. \"Jun, perhaps we should leave them and try to find our suite?\"Jun nodded. \"Yes, Elder. Oh, Master Esejef, Ms. Waterbloom... there might be anti-magic fields. Don't be scared if you guys can't... you know...\" She made an odd gesture towards her forehead with both hands. Alanis and Esejef would smile politely. As they made their way through the interior, Jun waved over at Naoki, just as an acknowledgement. She didn't want to interrupt their discussion.One more thing.\u00a0Esejef mischievously grinned when he saw the portrait of a certain someone hanging on a fireplace.\"Hmm, seems like a nice fellow.\" He said. He wasn't one to pry, but he couldn't help sense Jun's sudden consternation at the painting and was wise enough to put two and two together.

This suspicion is further fueled at the end of the day, but without anything in particular to support her suspicions, Naoki takes no action other than sleeping somewhat uneasily.The following morning, Naoki arrives at The Moonlight Eclipse with the intention of eating there and then proceeding to The Citadel to begin her work day. Skarlet\u2019s note finds Naoki just as she\u2019s about to begin breakfast, which happens to be cubed ham served with honey and a loaf of warm bread. It only takes Naoki a moment to read the note, but in that second, her appetite is ruined. Following a very brief but intense burst of anger, Naoki bites her lip and begins to contemplate her next move, not quite so quick to accept this development as it has been thrust upon her.Assuming that the ship didn\u2019t depart in the night (Passage in and out of Port Silverion is heavily restricted from dusk until dawn),  it couldn't possibly be very far. A skilled captain, of which the navy has a fair few, perhaps with the assistance of a few of the Enclave\u2019s wind mages, could easily catch up to whatever sort of dingy that Electrum woman purchased. Or it the ship had departed the previous night, overtaking it might be a bit troublesome, but not for a Gauldish airship, which Naoki feels confident in her ability to secure the services of- given the favors she has done the Gauldish royal family in the past, and the cordial relations between their respective countries. Failing even that, some manner of agreement might be able to be worked out with the \u2018Sea Queen\u2019 being Jun liaised with on the topic of the Isra - Gauldin Sea Lanes as they were being established.However, just as she places a finger on her earring with the intention to start issuing mobilization orders, Naoki pauses- frozen in place. It is at this point that she stops to think -- to question if she should act so hastily.The first answer that jumps to mind, is \u2018Yes\u2019. It\u2019s very nice and all that Skarlet has a desire to grow as a person, but there are ways to grow as a person without traveling hundreds of miles by sea to investigate a shady rumor of a completely unknown civilization! Of all of the things that one could possibly do, that it, as far as Naoki is concerned, one of the single most dangerous things, simply based on the number of unknown variables. The enhanced physiology of a vampire doesn\u2019t help very much against such perils as storms, shipwrecks, or monsters of the deep. The seas off the northern coast are -- if one would believe the tales of seadogs, among the most dangerous to be found, as far as perils and monsters and such go.  Beyond that, there is no guarantee that the land in question even exists. Naoki knew, when she posted the flyer, and when she spoke with Quis, that the task was very possibly a wild goose chase. If it indeed doesn\u2019t exist, the ship\u2019s crew and Skarlet would be left in the open ocean, with a questionable amount of supplies and an equally long journey back. Depending on how much fresh water Quis choose to take along, the crew dying of dehydration at sea is a very real possibility. And, while Naoki supposes that Skarlet would have the opposite problem, Naoki doubts Skarlet\u2019s ability to captain the vessel alone back to anywhere in particular.Furthermore, if the land in question does exist, and there are indeed beings living upon it, there is still no guarantee that they will be friendly. Most sorts of humans aren\u2019t, on the whole. Naoki can\u2019t even bring herself to speculate about that possibility, resting her elbows on the table and planting her chin in one palm. For a while, she simply sits as such. Silently, attempting to clear her mind. After a moment, she glances down to read the note again. Please don't worry about me. Naoki scoffs and slaps the tabletop, in that moment more irritated by the note\u2019s final sentence than its premise. It\u2019s somewhat insulting, she thinks. What sort of self-respecting parental figure would be able to do such a thing in this situation?After another moment, Naoki moves to rest her face in one hand and balls the other into a fist, tapping her knuckles on the tabletop slowly. Again, she attempts to approach the situation rationally and this time, arrives at a conclusion.Naoki resolves to proceed back to The Midnight Sun, where Skarlet\u2019s supply of blood is primarily stored. She will check to see how much is missing from the expected inventory -- how much Skarlet took with her. Then, based on how much that turns out to be and Skarlet\u2019s average rate of consumption (data which Naoki already has), she will then infer how long Skarlet\u2019s supply will last. With this information, Naoki will prepare a team or several of Sun Marshals to go seek out Skarlet as her supply ought to be very nearly reaching its end. That team would then either resupply Skarlet with more blood or retrieve her. Additionally, Naoki intends to go speak with Takhana Veil  as soon as possible, and request that she utilize her talents of scrying to keep a magical eye on Skarlet. She will observe, and the deployment of the team will be hastened if Skarlet appears to be in peril.This, Naoki thinks, is a very reasonable plan. It strikes a fair balance between being protective and overbearing, which is the sort of balance she supposes she ought to be striking in a matter such as this, and having a plan calms her to a degree. Still, her appetite cannot be recovered. Abruptly sliding her seat backward, Naoki stands and stalks from the room and then from the Moonlight Eclipse as a whole, Skarlet\u2019s note clenched in one hand.

It appears to have originated from Naoki, or at least her side of the seat.Unless Alli takes sudden action, two more would join the first, and together they would continue across her lower back and then slightly beyond that, to curve part of the way around her hip. Almost like resting a hand on one\u2019s shoulder, but tentacles and hips instead of hands and shoulders. From here, they move no further, seemingly content. Were Alli to glance down, she would be able to see them. They are, indeed, tentacles, and seem to be of the pale skinned, smooth, and featureless variety. Each of the three appears to be just the same as its fellows, and they look almost like fingers\u00a0- if fingers lacked nails and joints. The rounded tips seem to have a bit of fuzz on them, but that's about all one can say in describing the things.Meanwhile, Naoki is quietly eating her meal.

Further, the door itself appears to be made of the same stuff.

She moves first to an Employees Only door at the rear of the dining room where she comes face to face with a very surprised waitress. After exchanging greetings, Naoki wishes the waitress a good day and proceeds off to the right, to another door.From there, down one flight of stairs into a somewhat lengthy, gradually curving hallway, which she follows all the way to the end. Throughout the trip, one might notice an incredible variety in the magic present around them. Some are easy to identify, protection runes on the wall, everburning candles, and similar. Others are not as apparent in function. One may get the impression that The Eclipse is a bit larger than it might seem, and considerably more happens within than just fine dining. Soon enough, however, they arrive at their destination. A large, squarish room of a very peculiar description indeed.Someone innocent may take it for a sort of bedroom, on account of the large bed in the center of the room. Seemingly the only bed, though, around it, many other bits of furniture are spread. There are tables, chairs, couches, loveseats, cabinets, dressers, sets of drawers, and some more... unusual pieces of furniture. One seems to be a bench that curves up and down along its length. It doesn\u2019t look like a very good bench; one would slide down. There are a few\u2026 wedge shapes standing upright as if very thin sitting stools, as well as several other similarly strange items, the purpose of which may be unclear to the uninformed.A large portion of the furniture is storage furniture. Not shelves, mind you, only things that open and close. One might infer that that is where all of the room\u2019s objects are hidden, because there seems not a single non-furniture, non-pillow item visible in the room.Further inspection would find that even the furniture\u2019s placement is\u2026 illogical. Which is not to say the room is cluttered, but there are tables without chairs, chairs that face the wall, and countertops standing freely. Nothing seems to be oriented in relation to anything else in a way that makes sense. However, almost everything in the room has three common attributes. Upholstery is very prevalent. (There is even an upholstered table.) All protruding corners are rounded, and everything is bolted to the ground. In addition, there seem to be a great many hooks, o-rings, built into the ceiling, for whatever reason. The lot of it is lit by an unseen light source with a cozy orangish-glow. Presumably magic.

It did a fine job of showing off her wide hips, her sculpted tush, and long legs. The fabric's looser parts of the fabric open just under her left hip, showing off her pale leg as she walked, from calf to thigh, but covering herself just enough to stay tasteful. Of course a woman of her profession has to show the goods, and the cuts in the fabric don\u2019t stop just there. The collar of her dress cuts down deep, showing off a generous amount of cleavage below, while ending in a neat V halfway down her chest. Her shoulders are allowed to breath as her dress is held by a thin strap attached at her chest, that loops up and around the back of her neck, hidden by the beautiful golden necklace that sits around it, ending in a beautiful blue sapphire that sits very tactically within her cleavage. The material itself sits wonderfully on her figure, made from what can only be assumed is a soft, almost silk and cotton blend, no doubt made in some far off land. The dress almost shimmers in the low lighting of the bar, and the red is contrasted by golden thread and trim that line the outfit, completed with swirls of neat patterns around the mid section. Finally, along with her gold and sapphire necklace, she sports a matching bracelet, her silver dove brooch that sat on one hip where the fabric became loose, and earings, but those remain mostly hidden under the cascading waves of her dark hair. In some lights, her hair would appear brown, but in the light of the bar, it was almost black as night. Perhaps a trick she had picked up previously? It\u2019s hard to tell. She makes her way into the bar, a place she knew intimately, her high heeled shoes clacking against the floor below. Her whole ensemble is made to catch the eye, while maintaining a certain level of class and dignity, showing just enough to entice, but not enough that it could ruin one\u2019s imagination. The brooch, however, made it clear that she is indeed for hire tonight, and for a high price considering where she is.As she gets to the bar, she slips onto a seat and smiles at the man behind it, one she knew quite well by now. \u201cGood evening, Charlie,\u201d she says. \u201cThe usual please.\u201d The staff here knew her usual off by heart, not because she is here far too often for her own good, but because she asked them to remember. A clear cocktail, made from white spirits, some mixer for added flavour, and to water it down just a little, and a spiralled fruit peel that sat along the bottom of the conical glass. Part of her tactics involve appearing overly comfortable in her surroundings, which made her approachable. The woman\u2019s made a decent living doing what she\u2019s doing, she must have it locked down.  Now\u2026 to scope out the clientele. Rich, powerful, and gorgeous, three of the features she is on the lookout for. Her eyes dance over men and women alike, having no preference, as long as they can pay. She decides that tonight she would try to seek out power, knowing she could use some of the influence in some upcoming heists she had been planning. Once the pants drop, people tend to let their guard down too, allowing her to probe for information. Or perhaps just some fun, it had been a dreary week what with the Bluebirch incident. Either way?

What was the point in making money, he figured, if he couldn't enjoy spending it? No sense in being rich and bored, as far as he was concerned. Tonight, though, he had been very bored indeed. Dixie had been busy, and he hadn't intended on spending the night sober and alone, so he'd come here. After all, what better place was there to flaunt some wealth around and perhaps make some new friends? If they were friends who were very friendly and weren't too concerned about leaving room for their respective deities, all the better.He sat down at the bar, glancing around. The usual suspects were here, from hedonistic aristocrats to miners who'd stuck it rich to ladies of negotiable affection. However, one in particular stood out from the rest. His eyes fell on Fiona Blythe, where they stayed as long as they could until he forced himself to stop staring. She wasn't like the others, he thought. There was a certain class around her, an air of glamour. Something out of the ordinary. In certain\u00a0aspects she reminded him of Dixie, but the way she held herself was different. More...mature, almost. Most importantly, though, he spotted the silver dove sparkling on her hip. He knew that symbol, and he knew it well.

No sir, that was her job. The blue eyes of the woman near her catch her own as she looks over. Something about her is\u2026 odd. In a bad way? A good way? She can't quite tell, but she has a nice smile. Fiona smiles back, but her eyes go back on the wonder, looking for higher class prey. Sure, the woman looked nice, but she didn't scream wealth in the way that attracted Fiona. Then the glass of champagne arrives next to her, much to her surprise. \u201cWhy thank you, Chuck,\u201d she says with an affectionate smile, then follows his direction to the man.

The little time he has known her she always appears overly restrained.\" With the alcohol renewing his spirit, he appeared to re-focus on the establishment's ridiculous luxuries, yet slyly (or at least he thought so) slid into another conversation entirely in the same message.Reading Keph\u2019s message, Naoki shrugs lightly. \u201cIt also has to do with societal expectations, showboating, and the idea that people aim to have the best for themselves.\u201d\u201cConsider down there, Robert Fletcher, an excellent example. At the bar with the white hair.\u201d The Empress gestures through the railing of the balcony with her fork.\u201cRobert is my Minister of Primary Industry. Much of the work he does is related to importing and exporting goods through Port Silverion \u2014 where his office is. It\u2019s a very high position; he reports directly to me, has many responsibilities, and is paid very well. Robert is easily one of the most powerful and wealthy men in Isra.\u201dAs she pauses to chew her food, The Empress observes Robert and his friend for a few moments, angling her ears in an effort to catch a snippet of their conversation.\u201cYou may be able to tell,\u201d Naoki continues, \u201cHe\u2019s wearing a very expensive outfit. Here, at The Moonlight Eclipse, speaking with that expensive-looking woman, who he probably ordered an expensive drink. This is something he does often. Robert likes to flaunt his wealth; he takes pride in it and enjoys the sort of attention it earns him.\u201dA significant look is meant to imply that beautiful women only talk to Robert for one of two reasons and that woman probably isn\u2019t speaking with him about economic strategy. \u201cThat\u2019s why Robert engages in excess. Many others do so for similar reasons, most of which boil down to \u2018to impress others.\u2019 They do all sorts of little things to make sure others know just how wealthy they are. Fancy hats, elaborate speaking, landscaping their mansions\u2026\u201d Naoki waves a dismissive hand, the list goes on.\u201cBecause in certain cultural groups that exist in Isra, wealth is considered to be equivalent to the quality of an individual, and how much respect they are owed.\u201dHaving done her best to speak in what she thinks to be an objective manner, Naoki hopes that she\u2019s given Keph a fair explanation of the \u201cupper crust,\u201d as it were. It didn\u2019t seem like he was much in favor of such things to begin with, but now he hopefully has an improved understanding.\u201cI\u2019m not going to try to say that I'm much better, but I don\u2019t engage in excess for its own sake \u2014 if you\u2019d like to see that, you should visit Gauldin, and have a look at their nobility, they use gilded teacups. And I certainly don\u2019t need to assert anything.\u201d With that said and a light chuckle, she feels content to leave the matter there, rather than speak at length about herself.Naoki pauses to wipe her face before digging into Keph\u2019s next question. She considers it for a long moment before beginning. \u201cI could give you the courtly answer: that I practice archery. Or I could say that I read recreationally. Both of those things are true. But in an effort to be less \u2018restrained,\u2019 I\u2019ll just tell you that my favorite recreational activity is lovemaking.\u201dNaoki isn\u2019t sure if Keph was fishing for that answer or if she used his wording against him, but she doesn\u2019t mind either way.\u201cI have found that is there is nothing else that brings as much joy not only to me but to my partner. Seeing another person in the throes of ecstasy as a direct result of my actions\u2026\u201d She trails off, making a ring of her forefinger and thumb.\u201cThat\u2019s what life is about for me,\u201d she admits, \u201cEven in a grander sense than that. I serve Isra because I know it to be the greater good. The work that I do ultimately results in an environment where the people of Isra may lead happy and relatively easy lives, without fear of invasion, crime, starvation, and so on. I find it pleasing to use what power I have to help the people as a whole as well as individuals. It\u2019s impossible to help everyone, but I like to think I\u2019ve done much.\u201dNaoki offers yet another small shrug. \u201cThat\u2019s how I tick. \u2026 How\u2019s that for less restrained?\u201d", "link_list": ["/post/88181/thread", "/user/1179"], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/gMHWklJ.png"], "html": "<div author=\"@keph\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/88181/thread\" timestamp=\"1546483447\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-1179\" title=\"Keph\"><img alt=\"Keph Avatar\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/gMHWklJ.png\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/88181/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1546483447000\" title=\"Jan 2, 2019 18:44:07 GMT -8\">Jan 2, 2019 18:44:07 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-1179 group-0\" href=\"/user/1179\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@keph\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Keph</span></a></span> said:</div>Keph shrunk in his seat as the Empress showed him a bit of appreciation for his compliment, immediately after he looked down at the floor; no doubt she's heard constant compliments from everyone else and no doubt they must get exhausting.

Through her actions, Naoki makes it clear that the night will progress as she sees fit, but not in such a way that robs Keph of all agency.After the first freebie, Naoki introduces the premise that they will be going \u201cone for one,\u201d meaning that anything Keph wishes to receive he must first give to her. Typically, such a policy would be unenforceable, but it just so happens that she has a handy-dandy little ring that will do precisely that, and it just so happens that she slid it on him a few moments ago. This necessarily leads to some amount of frustration for Keph, as he must expend considerably more effort than he would otherwise to achieve the same end. Alternately, he is subjected to what may be best described as an onslaught until the seemingly arbitrary point Naoki is satisfied. As inequitable as though this may seem, 1:1 is as fair as it gets, and, as she points out, otherwise he would be out within an hour.But for as frustrating as it may be, Naoki thinks it a very effective way to teach. As the night stretches on, she coaches Keph and critiques his technique, telling him how to adjust his angle, when to change his pace, and so on \u2014 and why. She does this primarily for her own benefit but does so regardless, bestowing upon Keph a portion of her vast wisdom. And through the skillful application of these learnings, Keph would find that Naoki is not impossible to please. She always maintains a great deal of control but can be quite receptive when she\u2019d like to be. And sometimes she is, intending to preserve at least a portion of Keph\u2019s ego. For her part, Naoki seems to enjoy herself. She\u2019s always relished the reactions of her partners. Their faces, the funny little sounds they make, and so on. She particularly enjoys the sound of the naive as they experience sensations for the first, second, third, fourth, fifth time\u2026 And the fact that Keph doesn\u2019t speak makes it that much better because if she does it juust right, she can tease noises out of him where there were none before! As a challenge for herself, Naoki directs the evening in such a way that is intended to coax as much out of Keph as she possibly can.They continue long into the night, with occasional breaks for Keph to catch his breath and for Naoki to fuel the fire. But it doesn\u2019t seem as though she\u2019s getting tired. She goes and goes and goes, spurring Keph on with encouraging words, the appeal of her body, and fun little tricks she can do with her fingers. Where Naoki gets all this energy is anyone\u2019s guess, but the correct answer would be the tattoo on her inner thigh. It channels just the smallest trickle of lust magic to keep Naoki as energized and enthusiastic as the moment they started. One perk of making deals with demons.And they continue long into the night! Naoki is determined to get her evening's worth out of poor Keph, even if it means he\u2019ll be sore for weeks to come, and even if she has to do the last of it herself. With the fire at her back and the shadow of her tail twisting and dancing on the far wall, Naoki continues until the point where it seems Keph has been thoroughly exhausted and has nothing more to give.The only sounds in the room are heavy breathing and the crackling fire. Naoki remains exactly where she is. The shadow of her tail has slowed to a gentle wave, and over the course of a few moments, her breathing returns to normal.From her vantage, Naoki looks down at Keph. His hair\u2019s a mess. He\u2019s tired, sweaty, almost as filthy as she is, and above all, spent. \u2026 But he\u2019s still rather cute, in that roguish, amusing, yet simultaneously youthful and innocent way that he is. He has a certain charm about him \u2014 even from this angle.Terribly pleased with herself, Naoki smirks one of her high-order smirks. With one hand on Keph's chest she rolls her hips one last time,\u00a0and then she's done.At some point, Keph would wake to find himself alone in the lavish room. Under a clean blanket, but alone. Naoki and her belongings are nowhere to be seen. The notebook he brought with him lies open on the nightstand. A page has been removed, and a note written on it.Keph,You weren\u2019t able to fully appreciate food served at The Moonlight Eclipse, but I hope you enjoyed our date nonetheless - I did.

Luckily, Keph had long learned how to push its most cosmic of complaints (sometimes for the most minutiae of things) into the background.For an ancient power, it could behave quite childishly, yet he never thought it\u2019d to so squeamish to endlessly whine over two mortals enjoying themselves.But then, there was that ring - golden with frilly symbols along its border, and tight - it was something Keph wouldn\u2019t be caught dead wearing, yet there it was, wrapped around his ring finger. When Naoki had slipped it onto him, he did not know, he also had no clue why, but something about it gave him the most foreboding feeling, the kind that would make the spine of even the bravest of heroes shiver. Sadly, it did not take the young adventurer long to find out just why exactly Naoki had slipped it onto him. As any sane person would, he quickly tried to remove it, yet it appeared he was stuck with it and because of such, the night would end up stretching on a lot longer than it should\u2019ve. While it might\u2019ve been of much benefit to Naoki who appeared to be nearly impossible to satisfy and had far too much energy in the bedroom, the ring did little to increase his own endurance and simply acted as the stick to the carrot that was the Empress.The night stretched on\u2026...a mouth isn\u2019t suppose to--and on\u2026...he didn\u2019t know she could--and on\u2026...they weave only small webs, but then manipulate them to trap prey--and on\u2026Until, finally, it was over. Suffice to say, by the time Naoki was satisfied, dawn had almost arrived. An exhausted Keph lay there, messy and sweaty, with Naoki dropping besides him, he could finally close his eyes and try to get as much sleep as he could before morning greeted him.It had been a long, exhausting hellish, yet somehow still heavenly night.Keph lay on his back, his chest slowly rising before falling back down. A rapid succession of \u201cow\u201d\u2019s followed after a few breaths, his body seemingly just remembering the heavy strain it had been put through, just a few hours ago.The morning Sun greeted his skin with its warm embrace, and with a sly smile he considered that maybe his lover deserved the same. With another wince and a quiet \u201cow\u201d, Keph rolled to his side, wrapping an arm around Naoki and placed a kiss on her\u2026 his eyes popped open has he felt a noticeable lack of an Empress in his embrace. Naoki was gone - not just her, but any trace of her: Naoki was gone, her clothes, the fire she had lit, even the sheets, which a rather optimistic Keph liked to imagine was gone through Naoki\u2019s own efforts, as opposed to a set of servants. Whichever of the two (although he knew well which of these scenarios was the most plausible), they had erased any evidence of their prior night. The clean had no doubt been done in hopes of giving the slumbering man a more comfortable resting experience, yet it was still an odd blow to him.Keph sat in the king-sized bed, a blank stare and a slight smile on his face. He didn\u2019t want to admit it, but as much as the night had been as purely physical for him as it had been for the Empress, he did feel excited to enjoy a nice breakfast in her company. Keph briefly considered going out, finding her, and bothering her for exactly that, but quickly realized just how foolish the idea sounded.He sighed, telling himself that he was quite lucky to have had the opportunity to share a bed with such a degree of royalty. He silently praised his own prowess, his charisma, chuckling and flexing an arm, promising to himself that he would be so lucky, once more - he wasn\u2019t sure he truly intended to keep that promise, that was however before he noticed a page ripped straight from his notebook, resting on the same. He could tell \u035f\u0315\u0361\u035e \u035c\u031b\u0340\u0358 \u0335\u035f\u0327\u0334 \u0341\u0362\u0321\u0338 \u0337\u0335\u0361\u0321\u0361 \u035e\u0358\u0336\u035e\u031b \u0362\u0341\u035c\u0337 \u0322\u034f \u0322\u0361\u0315 \u0327\u0361 \u035e\u0358was not happy, rather \u201cunhappy\u201d might\u2019ve been understating it, it was as \u201cunhappy\u201d as a totally alien entity could possibly be\u2026...yet Keph smiled and shrugged. It wasn\u2019t that big of a deal, after all, it was just his notebook.He dragged himself to the other side of the bed, taking both the note and the journal underneath. With the journal resting on his lap, his eyes rapidly scanned through the contents of the note and found himself delighted with it, even more so when he noticed there was more left on its rear.The young man gave a hearty chuckle - of course he was going to accept, what sort of moron would turn this down? The Infinity that Hungers didn\u2019t appear to agree. Keph\u2019s eagerness to take the Empress on her offer angering it even further. Yet, he felt like he knew \u201cRara\u201d well enough by now to know that, in time, his patron would calm down and live to accept his mortal choices. He figured his patron was merely disturbed by some unknowable and immortal (and therefore, to Keph, an unimportant and inconsequential) reason.He lay back down on the bed, his body aching too much for him to bother getting up juuuust yet.

The stars shine bright in the sky, dimmed only marginally by the brilliance of the city below and a cluster of thick black clouds. The invigorating scent of a rainstorm just passed hangs in the air. The paved stone pathway is damp, and narrow puddles have formed in the dips between stones, but there are no pits in the road given the proximity to Isra's core and the resultant extra care given to its upkeep.While the roads are fairly clear due to the rain, the Eclipse itself is as lively as always, full of affluent patrons. Its lights shine out over the darkness of the street before it, offering sanctuary from the night.The clopping of massive, heavy hooves upon stone precede the arrival of the gargantuan Ulfang von Haren, king of the Black Vale, mounted upon a shaggy sable Northern Vale horse that itself must be at least seven foot at the shoulder. The king is dressed in a black silk doublet with silver buttons depicting a raven's head and woven in intricate silver brocade. Its collar is upturned and hides his thick neck, and its silver lined sleeves are frilled at the ends. He wears a pair of thick black leather riding gloves, well worn by time but still of very high quality. His breeches are made of a plain, but elegant layered black silk weave, with silver buttons down the front matching those upon the doublet. His calf boots are made of the finest leather, although their style in Isra is a touch outdated; they are made with overlapping flaps of leather that are buttoned on one side, a style that's not been popular in ages.In fact, to the inner city Isran, his entire dress would seem to be something of an anachronism, but he wears it well. As well, his beard has been trimmed and his hair has been slicked back and tied off in a ponytail behind his head, a style that he doesn't wear often, but which fits him well. He seems to have been unaffected by the rain, though he must have been caught in it.He trots his giant of a horse right up to the front of the Eclipse and dismounts, tying the beast off at a nearby post without requesting help from any of the staff, likely highly irregular among the aristocracy of Isra. He scratches the mane of the horse and it gives an appreciative whinny, before dipping its head to lap at the trough beneath the post.Ulfang has no concept of the notion of being fashionably late, and so he arrives at the exact agreed upon time, to the second. As such, he has arrived before his date, and so he waits outside the establishment, slipping his hand into his doublet to withdraw a long, thin oaken pipe and matching tinderbox from within. He fills the pipe with a light green powder, lights it, and returns the tinderbox to its place.The thin wisp of smoke that escapes smells pleasantly of vanilla and firewood. Ulfang puffs contentedly on the pipe as he awaits the Empress herself, ruminating on what luck he's had to gain her favour so quickly.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<b>[The night before the Blue Blood riots, 19:00 sharp]</b>"}, "post-96247": {"user": "Empress Naoki", "user_num": 607, "timestamp": "1586127488000", "message": "A few moments pass before a host exits the building and approaches Ulfang. \u201cLord,\u201d he begins, giving a half-bow of courtesy, \u201cShe is inside.\u201d The Empress has evidently arrived by alternate means.
