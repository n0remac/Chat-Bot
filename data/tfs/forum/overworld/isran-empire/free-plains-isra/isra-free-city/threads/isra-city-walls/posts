The walls are solid, smooth and white, leaving no obvious lines where brick might have been joined together. The wall itself is twenty-five feet thick and sixty feet tall, making it incredibly resistant to penetration, infiltration or damage.\u00a0The top of the walls are patrolled by archers and soldiers, with civilians and tourists generally only allowed to the top of certain sections of the walls during daylight hours and watched closely by guards to ensure that nothing criminal takes place. Both sides of the walls are topped by parapets and battlements, though the inner battlement is used mostly for safety rather than defending from the inside; though this would enable such a feat if needed. The walls are also adorned by other defences, such as trenches of boiling oil that can be thrown down on attackers, as well as wall-mounted ballista.\u00a0Spaced evenly along the entirety of the total wall length are twenty four large, fortified towers, which are circular and extend past the flat curtain of the main wall by a few feet in order to allow defending soldiers to view the bottom of the walls through crenellations. In addition, these towers are taller than the main walls by a good twenty feet, making them around eighty feet tall in total. The top of each individual tower features battlements, along with a single trebuchet made of magically-conductive metal capable of slinging ammunition to around nine hundred meters away from the city walls.\u00a0These fortified towers also offer the only access up to the walls, as well as serving as barracks and armouries for soldiers who live there. Each tower generally also serves as the office of a Captain, who patrols the surrounding wall and streets with a company of guards who work in a law-officer capacity.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://oi64.tinypic.com/e62lfs.jpg"], "html": "Surrounding the outermost areas of Isra - The Free City, the city walls are huge constructs of fortified stone that would defy even the greatest of siege weapons.
