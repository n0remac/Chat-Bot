The mahogany-brown trunks of these ancient sentinels are akin to giant pillars, holding up the emerald green canopy through which a verdant glow filters through to the forest floor below where moss and mushrooms mingle with ethereal wisps of mist swirling among the lichen-encrusted roots. The forest is almost completely serene - no sound disturbs the tranquility of the small forest clearing except for the low hum of magic from the stone archway engraved with runic symbols that stood in its center. Extending down from the small hill the archway stood upon and snaking through the forest, an ancient cobbled path extends, leading to the various areas of The Enclave.Following along the cobbled path eventually leads to three gigantic oak trees. All along their trunks, one can see windows, and walkways extending from the still living ancient trees. To and from each of these massive sentinels along the paths is a bustle of activity as many Enclave mages go about their daily business. Many of the interiors of these trees seem impossible at first glance upon entering them, as one quickly finds many of the spaces within to be altogether too big to fit even in these massive oaks.The tree containing the College of Arcane Arts is called the Oak of Knowledge, the tree containing all administrative spaces as well as The Vault the Oak of Order, and the tree containing all residencies for The Enclave mages the Oak of Commons.Links to Sub-LocationsOak of KnowledgeOak of OrderOak of Commons", "link_list": ["https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_QxGtXSa9E", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/3551/42-sunrise-boulevard", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/3552/nondescript-cabin", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/3548/enclave-oak-knowledge", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/3549/enclave-oak-order", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/3550/enclave-oak-commons"], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/YxtWe4K.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_QxGtXSa9E\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Music</i></a></div>"}}
