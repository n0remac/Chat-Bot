Their drinks are known for being of very high quality, and the tankards they use to serve their ale are massive in size, and relatively inexpensive. They are one of the few establishments to carry Medanese Gold, a fine wine produced in Medan.The establishment itself sits fairly close to The Citadel, and the first thing one notices walking down the streets is its large sign displaying a woman bending over and winking at the observer, nude but tactfully covering all the private areas with strands of her long, orange hair. Above the picture are the words The Saucy Maid scrawled in a gold-plated fine script. The Tavern has two levels, one massive one for the main bar area and a myriad of different-sized red oak wood tables, and an upper one housing ten rooms used for those who are too drunk to return home, or those who wish for a more...private setting for their drinking and joy-making. The barmaids are renowned for their beauty, all dark-haired, slightly tanned, and very volluptous, hailing from the same far-off land as the family who runs the tavern. The finely-crafted\u00a0bar itself is run by the proprietor of the establishment, a finely-crafted gentleman with dark, messy\u00a0hair and dark features, his strong jaw nearly always covered with stubble and his tunic always unbuttoned to showcase his well-built slim figure. He has a ready grin and a charmingly exotic accent, and his name is Francesco\u00a0d'Artusio. He is quite the lady's man, and he is the reason most of the female customer base returns for business, rather than simply the fine wines or ales, or even the\u00a0d'Artusio\u00a0family's famed pies, created with fluffy, thick\u00a0dough, a spicy tomato sauce, a strangely soft, yet delicious cheese, and pieces of meat. Truly, this place is one of a kind.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i61.tinypic.com/2m66csw.jpg"], "html": "<p><strong><u>The Saucy Maid</u></strong></p>"}, "post-11030": {"user": "Andraste Ruana", "user_num": 264, "timestamp": "1442964677000", "message": "<Enter from The Conjunction>As Andraste walks through the door, trailing Vain and Vigil, they're instantly greeted by the massive, musclebound\u00a0bouncer known as Regalio d'Artusio, who, upon a quick inspection with an eye that Andraste can tell is artificial by way of sensing its magical aura, nods to them and steps aside to let them through. He does keep an eye on Vain, however; his magical eye sensed something...off about that one. The scene they're greeted with after the musclebound bouncer's allowance into the establishment is much more pleasant. The tavern is lively and rowdy even at this fairly early hour. A couple of desert Dwarves sit at a table in the corner, drunk after apparently several dozen tankards of ale and singing a song in a foreign language. A few well-dressed humans sit at another table nearby, lounging in finely-dressed clothing and sipping Pheonix Red as they talk in sophisticated tones. Truly, it's a melding of atmospheres, but somehow it's welcoming and homey. The smell of freshly-cooked \"pizza pie\", as they call it, emanates throughout the tavern from a huge brick oven behind the bar, off to the side a bit.Andraste sits down upon a barstool, the finely-crafted leather and down seat extremely comfortable upon her still-sore backside. She smiles at Francesco d'Artusio as he comes over to greet them, his charming grin splayed across his facial features. \"Ah, Andraste Ruana, my favourite customer!\" he states in his lilting, lively accent. \"A glass of the gold for you, yes? And who are these?\" he asks, gesturing to Vain and Vigil. \"New friends of yours, I assume,\" he continues without letting her answer, giving her a knowing wink. Before she can object, he moves off to pour her a glass of Medanese Gold, calling something over to the woman who operates the stove, whereupon she begins to mould a piece of dough upon the counter beside her, flattening it out into a pan. He shouts another order to a busy-looking barmaid, who nods and runs back into the kitchen.Andraste turns to Vain, visibly blushing at Francesco's implication of their relations. \"Ah...so, this is The Saucy Maid.\u00a0Does it please\u00a0your senses?\u00a0I did not mention their specialty dish before; I wished it to be a surprise.
