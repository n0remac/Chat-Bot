In just a few short years, the population has raised from thousands to hundreds of thousands, to possibly over a million. We are now a huge part of international politics and we retain one of, if not the largest standing population in the known world. However, with this growth comes challenge. As many may know, a large majority of the plains beyond our city limits are now farmland. Farmers and their families work tirelessly to grow the crops and food we require to feed ourselves, lumberers hack into the forests beyond the river to supply lumber and quarries are dug to provide stone. Our growth rate has, indeed, been so exponential that we must now consider the costs of it. We are pushing the natural resources of our local country to its limits and soon, we will no longer be self sustainable. In addition, sanity problems persist in near-cramped conditions and healers fight against disease.It is therefore, with great regret, a majority vote has been passed in the Assembly declaring that no more refugees or migrants will be allowed to settle in the city. We can no longer afford our population to grow, but opportunities for such people will arise. As we speak, plans are being formed for smaller, outlying towns to be built on unoccupied land. Here, future inhabitants can settle and still consider themselves part of the dream that is our Free City. We will work for our resources over greater stretches of land, thus easing the burden placed upon any one part of it, and simultaneously allow our multicultural society to grow. To our allies and friends, I promise that our foreign policy has not changed. We still still remain neutral in all outside matters, and seek friends rather than enemies. We also swear an oath to not expand our borders in the direction of your own homelands, for we do not seek to gain monopoly over your own homes.And finally, to my fellow citizens, I ask that you continue to work together with your fellow to stay safe and sanitary. Please avoid public places if you are suffering from disease and instead call for your nearest healer. Make sure waste is properly disposed of to avoid the accumulation of dirty conditions and drink only clear, fresh water without trace of murk or infection.\"At the bottom of these papers, and at the end of these voiced declarations, a small, extra section would be added.\"Ildesias, Lord of the Free City, is hereby looking for at least one personal steward to aid in matters of governance. Please apply at the Citadel if you believe you have the experience and qualifications to work closely with him at the highest tier of government.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Throughout the Free City, papers would be handed out to citizens and criers would stand upon pedestals in the streets of markets and places of public gathering in order to relay the latest message from the Citadel; directly from Ildesias himself.
