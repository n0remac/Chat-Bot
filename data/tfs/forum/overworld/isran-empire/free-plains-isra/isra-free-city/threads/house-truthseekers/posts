It is home to the Seekers of the Celestial Truth, a religious group that looks to the stars for guidance. It is their belief that everything that has been and will be has been written upon the night sky by the gods of old, and have dedicated their lives to decoding and interpreting this infinite truth. All of the Truthseekers wear hooded robes and remain indoors to protect their eyes from the harsh light of day, and the twin heads of the House both remain blindfolded throughout the day to allow them to better see the stars. It is said that an experienced Truthseeker can point out any star in the night sky without even glancing up, and that their night vision rivals that of a cat. Most citizens are mistrustful of the strange, hooded Truthseekers, often crossing streets or locking doors to coming in contact with them.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.pinimg.com/564x/22/16/aa/2216aab4f314f8c76f538ce053b1936d.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.pinimg.com/564x/22/16/aa/2216aab4f314f8c76f538ce053b1936d.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/><br><font size=\"5\">The House of the Truthseekers</font><br/><div style=\"text-align:left;\">One of the more ornate temples of Isra, the House of the Truthseekers is a large, dome-shaped building in the heart of the capital.
