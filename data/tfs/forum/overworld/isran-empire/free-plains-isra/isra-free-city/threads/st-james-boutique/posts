The gold lettering on the glass of the door seems elegant and hand painted, the blushing pink roses to either side very manicured in their pots. In one window, a handsome tailored outfit for a gentleman is paired with a lovely gown for a woman. In the other window, a display of hats, from pretty bonnets, to wide starlet brims, to masculine dusters.Yes, this shop is well kept, but it is no different than anything you have seen before. Yet, you feel compelled to go inside. A little bell chimes above your head, and the inside of the shop seems just as clean and orderly as its outside. There is a small fireplace decorated with a lovely vase of fresh flowers, and a sofa with two chairs to either side and a coffee table, a tea set upon it. Several gowns, beautiful and well made are on headless dummies, and an arrangement of gloves and hats are laid out on a table.\u00a0Everything seems perfectly ordinary, but one piece of clothing... perhaps its a dress, perhaps its a hat, perhaps its a coat, seem to call to you. You feel as if your life just might change if you only make that one purchase.And yes, if you are magic sensitive, it seems to be woven into the clothing items, but not to trick. No, no, there is always something in St. James Boutique that has been waiting for just the right owner.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://www.fontsquirrel.com/widgets/test_drive/e3f2b3cd371516a14851583f5c1c82c9?s=72&t=St.%20James%20Boutique", "http://www.gailmccormack.com/images/TheFrenchDressShopmain.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><font color=\"ff1e00\"><u><b><font size=\"7\"><font face=\"verdana\">CLOSED AND EMPTY</font></font></b></u></font><br><img src=\"http://www.fontsquirrel.com/widgets/test_drive/e3f2b3cd371516a14851583f5c1c82c9?s=72&amp;t=St.%20James%20Boutique\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/><br/>\u00b7 CUSTOM DESIGN, TAILORING &amp; ALTERATIONS \u00b7<br/>\u00a0<br/><img src=\"http://www.gailmccormack.com/images/TheFrenchDressShopmain.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/><br/><br/></br></div>"}, "post-17321": {"user": "Lady Genevieve St. James", "user_num": 875, "timestamp": "1448772822000", "message": "Through the charming box windows of the store, the pretty figure of Genevieve could be easily seen.

The old grey of his cloak had been laundered and used as a trimming on the inside, but the outside was with a dark charcoal grey color, trimmed in neat but elegant dark green thread around its edges.The cape had a detachable hood, just in case he'd need that, and as she'd made it with a careful touch, she had spoken to the fabric of how it would have to last for many, many long journeys. It would have to keep its wearer warm and cozy, no matter the weather, no matter the toil, and she mentioned how she hoped this cloak wouldn't tear as easy as others had in the past.The material had seemed to respond to her as Genevieve had spoken life into the garment, and she smiled to herself as she ran her hand over the material. Hopefully, Alden would be pleased whenever he showed up, and with that thought in mind, she went to find a bag and tissue paper to package the item as she did all clothing items that left the store.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/d6/b0/4a/d6b04a684ecdc42d6c5be271fa9a7e65.jpg"], "html": "The store opened on time as it did every time, and just as usual, Genevieve's daughter, Odette, was no where to be seen.

Genevieve had wound up giving him the boots, but she had lost money in that. She could not afford to give away items back to back, especially when there was also another customer still in the room.The pretty blonde shook her head and laughed at herself, then looked to Skarlet with warm blue eyes. \"I will wrap your purchases.\" She named a tidy amount that seemed fair, and coupled with her warm and inviting air and hospitality, it seemed more like an excellent deal.She placed the jacket back in the open boudoir where she had taken it, where other handsome jackets were also displayed, then moved to go and wrap the items up in pretty packages that was a brand and mark of having purchased something from the fashionable St. James Boutique.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"Oh.

She was certainly proud of each of them, and it always sort of tinged a little when she felt as if people were denying their fate.She moved behind the table and began to pristinely pack and fold the clothing, lining them with softly scented tissue paper and fitting them \u00a0into perfect boxes, tying them with a blush-pink bow, as was the St. James Boutique brand.\"Gauldin?\" she asked with Gaulish inflection.

She felt like it wanted to be purchased.What another mage would look like wearing it.It looked like some sort of sun dress, with short shorts and knee socks and a loose fitting gown. There were also optional sleeves covered in a floral pattern that billowed out towards the bottom.

In fact, it was everywhere! Each individual item had some sort of spell weaved into it, and each spell was unique. The spell was subtle and sophisticated. It was as though each dress had a psionic algorithm which connected itself to a customer. But rather than manipulate the customer, it adapted itself to the customer's desires and somehow modified the article of clothing to best suit their needs. For instance, the dress she was holding had \"read\" her desire to be less prudish and reached out to her knowing it met the criteria. It then manipulated the threads themselves. This dress in particular lent itself easily to enchantment, and was highly compatible with magical energy.At least, that was her theory. There were other elements to the magic that she didn't quite understand. She could have sworn she sensed a faint temporal magic in the air too. If she didn't know any better, she'd guess the dresses were fated to meet with their customers.But that was silly... wasn't it? Huh.\"Hey, Lummie, leave an extra gold coin.\"She decided to take it.

It was not thoughtless, or hasty, or quick; it was not chosen by price, or even by color or shape, although as a stylist Genevieve did bear these thoughts in mind, but no.No, what made St. James Boutique unique was the magic crafted into every single item, the fate that was wound into each thread as it was built and constructed, by hand, by the lovely enchantress herself. These were not items that had been previously made with a charm thrown over, hoping that the magic might stick to the threads -- these items were made enchanted from the very beginning, as Genevieve poured her skill and power into every stitch that was made, every button that was sewn, every detail of the garment.It was not just as simple as picking a dress, nor as easy as going for just, whatever. Genevieve came to have an excellent read on her clientele and buyers, and had a talent for picking the exact item in the store that had already been calling to the customer as soon as the chime rang above them.So when Genevieve looked to the boudoir of dresses that she did not put out onto the floor, her gaze fell upon a deep, elegant, wine-coloured confection that made her cheeks warm and put a little tingle on her skin just to look at it.\"Oh, mon petit morte,\" she said, reaching for the gown. It was a deep rich color, made of velvet, and tailored to fit to a perfectly toned, hourglass body with breasts that were neither too big or too small, and hips of the same statute. Its neckline was wide and scooped, decorated simply with a scarlet-and-gold pattern. The sleeves were tight upon the upper arms and flowed out from the elbow, and it's skirt was long and luxurious. Indeed, as she was making this gown, she had thought of how the woman wearing it would look like a languid, intoxicating, sensual drink of summer wine, that beckoned to sultry nights and a carnal taste to savor.The gown itself was not overtly sensual -- its neckline wasn't low, there were no thigh slits, no shocking bare of the back -- but it's shape, the cling of the material to the torso, and the woman who filled it just so\u00a0would no doubt make those of a lesser-will almost salivate. After all, one's imagination\u00a0could be far more wicked, and the woman who wore this dress would be no mere courtesan. She would be a woman of self-possession, who knew the value of her worth, and would know that others would instantly look at her and agree with that price.In short, Genevieve knew\u00a0that this gown was enchanted for Madame Naoki, and no one else. It would be especially\u00a0conducive to her travels to Le Palais des Ailes\u00a0in regards to her negotiations and treaties with the people in charge there. They would be liable to give the woman whatever she wanted, while they imagined how beautiful that dress would look around Naoki's feet.Genevieve had to fan herself a little at the vision and glanced in the mirror. Her cheeks were flushed. It had been a long\u00a0time since sensual thoughts had even entered her mind, and perhaps that was why this\u00a0dress in particular was packed with so much sexual suggestion.Taking a breath and putting herself to as much rights as she could, she quickly packaged the dress in another silver box, folding it in paper, and putting the lid upon it. Out of sight, she felt much more of her composure come back, and the bow she wrapped around it was cinched perhaps tighter than she had the others.Then, she moved back out. Of course, Naoki would not be able to see it, but Genevieve was hoping she could convince her. Clearing her throat lightly so as not to rudely interrupt whatever conversation might have been going on between Naoki, Artemis, and Skarlet, she gave a smile to Naoki.\"I have chosen your dress. It is of a deep cabernet colour, created to outline the curves of your torso and flow freely from your hips and elbows. I think you will be very pleased, but please, I recommend that you try it on at home.\" She handed the box over to Naoki, a light blush touching her cheeks. \"I am very sure that you will be pleased with it, but if you are not, you can return it when you come back from Travere.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/11/f6/c6/11f6c6ab209c270f2ee7b7ebb6728b5f.jpg"], "html": "When the owner of St. James Boutique picked out a garment for a customer, it was not just a random choice.

In the meantime, in between bites of scone, she casually observes the dealings, and manages to pin Roy\u2019s identity down with some help from Reese. Royal Fletcher, resident student of The Royal Academy of the Arcane, first year. Dormitory 393, roommate to Mr. Maelik, who is also the source of the entirety of Roy\u2019s file. Naoki had seen his face once as she was conferring with Reese in his office, one of the mirrors was trained to \u2018see\u2019 though Maelik\u2019s eye, and Roy was, at least for a moment or so, the object of Maelik\u2019s attention. However, beyond these basic details, and some notes regarding his exploits with Maelik, Roy, as he appears on file, seems wholly unremarkable. Some minor rune-magics, and the vampirism bit of course, but not particularly powerful or skilled in any way known to Reese. Skarlet\u2019s information is relayed, and also added to file (with a note to follow up with Skarlet later for supplementary information), but does little to add to Roy\u2019s prestige. He may be capable of putting up a fight, simply by virtue of being a vampire, but hardly seems like the sort to pick one, and even if he does decide to, Artemis would have no issues subduing him, to say nothing of Skarlet or the Operatives on the streets outside. With more complete information, Naoki stands by her earlier assessment, of Royal being of no particular importance. However, the other individual entering the room manages to captivate Madame Naoki\u2019s attention more thoroughly, and warrant investigation. This is due in part to Naoki\u2019s predisposition toward curiosity and wishing to know fully of all that happens around her, but in some way, the room\u2019s latest occupant seems to be of some note, though Naoki isn\u2019t quite sure how. For starters, she hadn\u2019t entered through the front door; not a customer. Not only that, but she seemed surprised to see everyone down here. That calls into question either her awareness as an employee, or paints her as something else entirely. Perhaps a family member, or friend? Naoki is unaware of any familial relations Genevieve may or may not possess, but the tax paperwork for this home, (which she had reviewed prior to her visit) only lists Ms. Genevieve St. James, and her daughter, Odette. If this woman is a resident of this establishment, they\u2019re either living here without proper documentation, or visiting. Perhaps from another home in Isra, or perhaps from abroad.Raising a hand in greeting, Naoki nods to the woman, and takes a moment to examine her features. Red hair, blue eyes, wearing clothing intended for travel. Probably made by Ms. Genevieve; the quality isn\u2019t hard to identify, even from across the room. Speaks with a rather heavy Gauldish accent, and addresses Genevieve somewhat casually. Comparing their faces, Naoki notes some resemblances, but is hesitant to base any conclusions on it; she isn\u2019t an expert judge of faces, and most of the resemblance probably lies in that they\u2019re both beautiful Gauldish women of seemingly similar age, and happen to have the same color of eyes.Having gathered what information she can visually, Naoki politely averts her glance, and seemingly switches her focus to one of the floral arrangements sitting near her, though her mind\u2019s eye remains trained on the red-haired woman. Though she seems familiar in some way, Naoki decides that she can\u2019t quite place her, and defers to Reese. If they are someone important, he\u2019ll know, and will probably be able to identify them based on the physical characteristics Naoki is relaying to him now. Her earring glimmers slightly as she does so, and shortly, Reese should locate some results, even if those results are that the woman is as insignificant as Roy, and has so far avoided his notice. Until then, Naoki remains as she is, sitting quietly on the sofa, gaze lazily drifting around the room. She muses that she won\u2019t run out of objects to casually examine any time soon, St. James Boutique certainly has no lack of detail, between the floral arrangements, and all of the highly numerous and well made garments on display.

To look at both women, one could see that they were both finely dressed, although Arianne's clothes seemed to be made of a finer quality of material. Arianne was still in her youth, a young woman of around eighteen, whereas Genevieve had grown into a mature beauty and seemed in her thirties. They were both beautiful, with similar structure of their faces and the same incredible blue eyes. It was the difference in height, with Genevieve slightly taller, and the hair color that might throw people's perceptions off.At this time, Artemis spoke up, regarding a blue dress that Genevieve was particularly proud of. The neckline sweeping into the sleeves had been a bit of a challenged to get the angles just right, but the resulting effect was somehow both whimsical and assertive.\"Just, please, wait a little more before you go tearing off into the wilderness again,\" Genevieve said to Arianne, this time in a common tongue that everyone could understand, and went over to Artemis with an apologetic smile. \"I apologize for not attending you sooner.\"She reached out to run a hand down the sleeve of the gown, a small smile of affection on her face as she regarded the garment. \"The enchantment I wove into this one was one of grace and balance and poise. The woman who wears this will never be caught off foot, and will be as graceful as a swan on a lake at every moment.\" She turned to look at Artemis. \"You have a good eye for color. This blue will make your hair shine like your gold, and your lovely eyes seem all the more bright.\"Odette, the ten-year-old girl child, with golden hair and blue eyes as her mother but already the signs of a beauty that would far outshine her mother's own with just a bit of time, came peeking around the corner. She was small for her age, and her skin did seem somewhat pale, as if she did not spend much time beneath the sun. She seemed healthy and curious though, dressed in innocent white with button-up boots to her ankles.When she spied Skarlet however, the little girl slipped from the back door that Arianne herself had come from and went directly over to the vampire lady, sitting directly next to her. She was not scared or afraid, and perhaps that was because she was never taught to be.\"I made those cookies,\" Odette informed Skarlet with pride, her Gauldish accent light. \"We bought the vanille from the market by a man who had skin as dark as night.

Even though she had already inspected Roy, she takes a moment to examine him while he\u2019s looking back, managing to infuse her gaze with a lewd undertone that may or may not make Roy rather uncomfortable. Very deliberately, she raises a hand, and gives a single, short wave, accompanied by one of her winks. Even if he is largely inconsequential, she still finds some enjoyment in teasing for the sake of it. However, a trained eye might notice, one of her ears is still trained in the direction of Genevieve and the newly identified red-haired woman, Arianne. Even if Naoki wasn\u2019t substantially proficient in Gauldish, the names don\u2019t translate. The red-haired woman was referred to as Arianne. Which is highly interesting! Arianne, the name used to refer to the thought-deceased Queen Arianne of Gauldin, wife to King Renaux. They were married last year, in a ceremony which Grandma attended. A few quick communications, consulting Reese\u2019s database confirms. Queen Arianne, as she was observed at her wedding, at least has the very same characteristics as this woman here. Red hair, blue eyes, a decidedly... ample bosom- even the height seems to match, based on Naoki\u2019s rough estimation from across the room, based on how she compares to Genevieve.The rest of their conversation even goes so far as to completely confirm her identity, \"I've decided to go back to Gauldin. To Renaux.\". Though she supposes that the possibility of there being multiple Gauldish women who match Queen Arianne\u2019s description is non-zero, there can only be so many that are also named Arianne, and would speak in such a manner about Gauldin and King Renaux.With evidence overwhelming, Naoki reaches a small collection of conclusions. First, the red-haired woman standing across the room must be either Queen Arianne of Gauldin, or at least someone doing a very admirable job of impersonating them. Secondly, as a sort of extension of the first, and discluding the possibility of a pretender, Queen Arianne must have survived what had thought to be the final voyage of her life. Instead of dying many months ago, lost at sea, she had found a manner by which to survive, and has now made it back to civilization as we know it. Thirdly, there must be some manner of close relationship between Arianne and Genevive; perhaps a familial one, or perhaps one of childhood friends, or of mentor and student. Looking more closely, Naoki realizes that her previous assessment of them being roughly the same age was false, but their conversation has just affirmed that they have some manner of close relationship. Additionally, and not quite so much as a conclusion, per-say, but more-so as an inference or assessment, the pair of them must be pretty awful with the concept of intrigue. To have such a conversation, which essentially fully confirmed Arianne's identity, in the presence of four essentially entirely unknown persons, was incredibly foolish. Naoki could, at a moment\u2019s notice, motion for Artemis to leap over and decapitate or subdue the pair of them. It would be over in a handful of moments, the two would be hopelessly overwhelmed by Artemis. As far as Naoki is able to tell, nothing could stand in her way, if she decides to make that call. There are some calming magics at play in the shop, perhaps, but those have little sway over cold steel. Without knowing if the customers in the shop are able to understand Gauldish, enemies of the Gauldish state, if they had any reason to harm or capture Arianne, or if they had the means to, it was very irresponsible to have that conversation. Loose lips sink ships, and Naoki feels that the pair of them should be more grateful than they know that she is positively inclined toward Genevieve and the Gauldish people. A Naoki that wasn\u2019t an Isranian minister, about to depart as head of a diplomatic embassy to Gauldin, would have twisted and taken full advantage of this opportunity for her own benefit fifty times over by this point. A Queen\u2019s Ransom is an awful lot, and she could probably twist Renaux\u2019 arm into giving her even more than that for the Queen, knowing him to be the unconfident sort of new King he is. The vast and powerful magical knowledge and wealth of Gauldin could be hers, rather easily, too. In fact, in thinking about it, the prospect is undeniably tempting. It doesn\u2019t even have to necessarily have to affect her diplomatic mission, it could be done separately, through a puppet. It isn\u2019t as if Naoki hasn\u2019t done something similar before, she muses.But no. Some combination of moral integrity, the location\u2019s mental magic, and Naoki\u2019s genuine positive opinion of Genevieve force her to dismiss the idea; she could, but won\u2019t. That still leaves a fair selection of options, though. She could simply choose to politely pretend not to have heard, and allow the two to continue on however they see fit. However, her natural tendency to take advantage of opportunities dismisses this course of action swiftly. It would be foolish not to do anything. That leaves one primary option: to attempt to work the situation to her benefit in a way that isn\u2019t disagreeable. Leaning back slightly, she reassess the situation with this strategy in mind, replaying the conversation in her mind, considering how to start taking action. If she\u2019s to assist Arianne, anonymity and security will be paramount. Even if Naoki isn\u2019t willing to take advantage of Arianne, there are plenty of others in the city who would, she knows. Good thing she\u2019s so good at protecting people, Naoki muses. Silently, she calls in reinforcements. Over the course of the next few minutes, Midnight Sun Operatives, previously positioned to act in the event that Naoki\u2019s trip to the Boutique went south, quietly surround the establishment. Roughly twenty of them are diverted from their standard patrols and duties to take up positions around St. James Boutique. Some settle on adjacent roofs, others circle the exterior of the building, identifying all points of entry, they systematically move to control each one.  Some others screen the street outside, assessing and attempting to identify each passer-by. Discluding the possibility of tunnels, it would become virtually impossible in a matter of a few short minutes to enter or exit St. James Boutiqe without getting past the Operatives. However, they are careful not to take up obvious positions around the front door; it wouldn\u2019t do to make their presence obvious. With security taken care of, Naoki turns next to anonymity. Understanding that Artemis and Skarlet would not be issues in this matter, that leaves the singular, glaring problem sitting only a few feet from her, munching on some chocolate and making small talk.Since she understands Roy to be a Gauldish citizen, it is a safe assumption to make that he knows the language. Seeing as how Arianne had been referred to by name, and she was, for a short while at least, The Queen, Roy should have no logical reason not to understand as fully as Naoki does. That makes him a security threat. Even now, as completely oblivious and incompetent as he seems, he could be reporting telepathically to another entity, or have some manner of scrying spell trained on him. Even though he himself is almost certainly unable to stand in their way in any meaningful way, one slip of the lips on his part could easily jeopardize Arianne\u2019s safety. (Assuming that she has any left, if this most recent display is at all indicative of her capacity to keep things quiet.) Naoki hasn\u2019t yet underestimated a potential threat, and doesn\u2019t intend to start now; Roy would need to be taken out.Assessing Roy again with new eyes, Madame Naoki continues her silent deliberation and communication with both Artemis and Skarlet, her face betraying none of her thoughts. One of her hands reaches casually into the black pouch on her hip, and selects a gem. It is a spherical, opaline white gemstone. Holding it concealed in the fingers of her right hand, Naoki quietly begins to channel small amounts of energy into the gem, preparing to utilize it. Still, she gives no outward indication of having understood quite so much, or preparing to take action toward Roy. As something of an expert in the skills of self-control, she manages to perfectly maintain her slight, pleasant smile, and carries on her seemingly casual examination of the shop's wares.

Her blue eyes, already round and wide somehow became larger when Skarlet informed the girl child of her own age of two. Was that even possible? Odette wanted to ask Maman, but Maman was busy with a blonde woman and Aunt Arianne (whom Odette had discovered was not very fun at all.)A boy came to speak with Skarlet then, and Odette blushed where she sat beside Skarlet on the sofa. She liked the look of Roy. He seemed nice, and he seemed handsome, and he knew of Odette's fondness for chocolate. What more could a ten year old possibly need in a boyfriend? Basbful, she only nodded to Royal and fell quiet as the adults spoke over her.They were always doing that. Speaking over her, or ignoring her. That was what the cat lady had done, too. In fact, she seemed to be looking at Royal, but not the way Odette had looked at Royal. The cat woman's expression was sort of blank. The lights of the building began to flicker, and the walls to groan. Odette watched Madame Naoki pull a marble from a bag, and blinked.\"I have some of those, too,\" Odette said to Madame Naoki, pointing at the hand where the little girl had seen the gesture. \"Yours is very pretty. May I see it?\"Suddenly, a drawer that was open to display gloves snapped shut with a bang. The chandelier overhead shook a little, its crystals chiming. Odette frowned. What was going on? All of Maman's store had a personality, but she had never witnessed it seem... angry before.Artemis then came to sit on Odette's other side, and the girl turned to look at her. \"I have never deen Maman's shop act this way before.\". . . . . . . . . . . . .Odette concluded her business with both Artemis and Royal, and moved towards the table to finish wrapping their things. Arianne was near her, so she spoke quietly.\"I just want you to be safe on your journey,\" Genevieve said, wrapping Artemis's dress in paper, folding Royal's things within another. \"My heart broke when I thought you were gone, I don't want it to happen again.\"She was unaware of the thoughts going on through Madame Naoki's mind, unaware that she had garnered respect through her own respectful and kind actions. The shop, however, that was enchanted to prevent conflict, as well as the number of inanimate objects that had been given \"life\" by Genevieve's presence could feel it, however.So the walls rumbled, and the lights flickered, and the chandelier rattled for a moment in distaste. It caught her attention and she turned to look at where the other customers were located within her store.She was aware of the Midnight Sun, having visited the place before, having cared for one of its employees. She had not liked the place, if only because it was not her style, and she had reserved judgement on its workers. Genevieve had liked Madame Naoki's forthrightness, she liked Skarlet, and Artemis had been nothing but polite.Still, Genevieve had missed something, and the sudden coldness in her heart had her worried. What had changed? Her daughter was there, speaking to Naoki about... something. Royal had entered... and Arianne... She was an idiot. Hadn't Madame Naoki told her not but ten minutes ago thay she was going on a diplomatic mission to Gauldin? She had to have some sort of.. of command of the language. Oh, Genevieve was a fool.She finished wrapping her customers' bags and box, and walked across the distance to hand each to its rightful owner. \"Here you are,\" she said with a smile that didn't seem as bright.\"Odette, I hope you are being kind,\" Genevieve said with a look to her only child.\"I am!\"Genevieve turned to Madame Naoki, and felt nervous but kept herself composed and poised, ever thr lady. Her warmth towards Naoki did not fade, but now there was a sort of... caution. Genevieve did not know who within the treasurer's group was harboring ill will. It must still only be a thought, for any violent or harmful recourse of action within the enchanted place would be in for a startling surprise.\"Madame Treasurer, please forgive my forwardness, but if, perchance, I can get things prepared for myself and my daughter and my... niece, may we share the road with you tomorrow morning for Gauldin?

Having only a rudimentary grasp of Gauldish herself, she had understood only portions of the whispered conversation, but Naoki's fluency revealed a very intriguing tidbit. So the Queen was still alive...Naoki's strategic analysis is spot-on, as usual. Artemis jumps into the task, aiding her in the telepathic direction of operatives, pointing out chokepoints, ambushes, and escape routes as only an experienced bodyguard can. When the drawer slams shut and the chandeliers shake, Artemis's head whips around to look at them. Her eyes glow an intense electric blue as she scrutinizes the shop. The aura has changed from its previously inviting atmosphere, becoming almost hostile. The magic permeating every inch of the building would be blinding to a magesight who didn't live in the Midnight Sun. The two businesses were similar only in a measure of luminous intensity, however. The magic of the Midnight Sun was careful, quiet, subtle. It dwelt in the walls, flowed throughout the floors; a presence as powerful and ubiquitous as a mountain, yet just as unlikely to interfere actively. A hint of danger was part of the appeal of the Sun, and the wards, tuned to respect that, would only activate under dire circumstances, and then with deadly force. The magic here was far less restrained. Like an impetuous child, it reacted to the slightest hint of perceived aggression or ill will, not even necessarily malevolent intent. Artemis identifies the stone in Naoki's hand as a sleeping spell. Totally harmless, but the shop was reacting with warning as if Naoki was preparing a lethal curse. A comforting type of effect, for a young shopkeeper and her daughter, but not the wisest one.The volatility of the magic and the dramatic shift between its dormant and inactive states provided a multitude of opportunities that a good cursebreaker could use to split open the protections like an egg. It was also too much based on warning and threatening, and scaring unwary assailants or unruly customers. Should an actual attack happen with prepared opponents, based on what she could see, the wards would be of quite little use in actual defense. It seems that naivete runs in the family. First, the queen having an open conversation with nothing but a relatively common language for defense, and now this? Regardless, it would be unwise to take any risks on what was simply a precautionary measure. She sends a mental message to Naoki, advising her to back down and stop channeling. Roy could be eliminated later with whatever degree of permanence required, or simply disallowed to come with them.At Odette's question, the fire in her eyes quenches, and she turns to regard the girl, giving a gentle smile. \"Really now? What does it normally act like?\"A meaningless question, she knew perfectly well how it normally acted, but a useful one nonetheless. It never hurt to be on the good side of a potential target's child, she had found.

Should Odette decide to pick it up, Naoki would allow her to, and there would be no magical effects. However, if Odette has the magical skill, she may be able to sense or even utilize the gemstone\u2019s sedative effect. Naoki looks upward to Genevieve as she approaches and poses her question. Royal now knows that Naoki is leaving for Gauldin, and is attempting to freeload. Naoki\u2019s focus shifts, as Roy proceeds to ask if he could join them on their trip. Then some half-dead thief stumbles in, mumbling to Roy. Brilliant. It\u2019s all Naoki can do not to bury her face in her hands, as frustrated with developments as she is. This situation was not supposed to develop in this way. She just came to get a damn dress. Naoki doesn\u2019t mind a couple of opportunistic developments, but this is simply ridiculous, now. However, her smile remains, the corners of her mouth turning upward slightly in a manner that might come off as forced. For the space of a moment, she drums the fingers of her unoccupied hand on the arm of her seat, before launching into action in an attempt to remedy the situation. The chimes attached to the door jingle once again, and another figure enters St. James Boutique. He is an impressively unremarkable man of middling age, dressed in a gray cloak. The symbol of The Midnight Sun is emblazoned on the right breast of his tunic, but is hidden by the cloak. He stands there for a moment, unsure, but presently begins to speak as Naoki puts words in his mouth, her earring glimmering slightly as she does so.\u201cI am with... The hospital!\u201d He extends an arm toward Ravven, collapsed as he is on the floor. \u201cAllow me to assist you, citizen!\u201dWithout waiting for an answer, the man bends down, and attempts to lift Ravven from the floor. Hopefully, in his unconscious state, Ravven wouldn\u2019t be able to do much about it. Assuming Ravven doesn\u2019t struggle or he is stopped, the man abruptly turns about, and exits, turning swiftly to the right and carrying Ravven out of sight.At this point, Naoki stands from her seat, and approaches Roy. She puts on her best convincing face, and implores him, \u201cYou should go with your cousin, he\u2019s hurt. You should accompany him to the hospital and make sure he\u2019s alright. I\u2019ll send someone to find you later, get out of here, gumdrop.\u201dAfter making sure that Royal has all of his items, Naoki drapes an arm around his shoulder and guides him to the door, patting him on the back and ushering him out. With Roy departed, Naoki waves out the open door, before pulling it shut, and flipping the sign to \u2018closed\u2019. With a short mental command, another Operative from the street, a large, burly sort of fellow, moves over to stand in front of the door. There would be no more entering the Boutique for the time being. With this reestablishment of order, Naoki turns about, takes a deep breath, and finally addresses Genevieve. \u201cMs. Genevive. I would be pleased to assist you and your... niece in any way that I can. However, please allow me to first introduce myself.\u201dShe turns to Arianne, placing a hand over her stomach as she performs a respectful bow. Here, she pauses for a moment, considering the etiquette. Is Arianne still a queen, at this point? She hasn\u2019t been officially divorced, just presumed dead. Since she hasn\u2019t actually died, Naoki supposes that she still is the queen, even if her country understands her to be dead. Somewhat like self-exile, perhaps. So if it\u2019s Queen Arianne, what is Naoki? Before she turns over her Letter of Credence to the head of Gauldish state, she isn\u2019t technically an operational Ambassador. But that\u2019s a bit of a technically, she supposes. She was still appointed as such, and has legal authority to act as such, even before the ceremony. That technically puts her on equal footing with Arianne, as a direct representative of Ildesias, a head of state. However, she\u2019s already started bowing, and can\u2019t really take that back. Proceeding forward, Naoki would pose on equal footing with Arianne, but a bit of respect the first time can\u2019t hurt, she supposes. Standing back upright, she addresses Arianne in Gauldish. Her annunciation is correct, but unpracticed. She hasn\u2019t spent very much time around Gaulish speaking individuals, and has not yet fully mastered the use of contractions, but is not quite so unpracticed as to be halting, and is very much understandable in her speech. \u201cI am Madame Naoki, Treasurer of Isra, and Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the nation of Gauldin. I could not help but overhear your conversation regarding your\u2026 predicament, and would like to formally offer my assistance. Tomorrow, I am departing  with my delegation for Trav\u00e9re. We  will be making use of  a local teleportation anchor to complete the trip in only a few hours. I would like to  offer you the opportunity to  join me on this journey, and return safely to your home.

Indeed, Genevieve felt safe in her home (and for good reason), and it had slipped her mind that Madame Naoki had mentioned her knowledge of the language. It was also obvious now, in hindsight, that she could have easily overheard it, given the treasurer's catlike features.Indeed, it was further foolish for Genevieve to openly request travel with the Embassy to Travere.

Even so, it had seemed as if things had come to a head.Arianne was talented for a blade, hidden beneath her riding coat, but she was sure that she would be outmatched by Artemis. Perhaps, in a more informal crossing of blades, Arianne might have at least been able to make her sweat, but for all of Arianne's training, both from instructors of her childhood, and from the hellish 10 month nightmare she'd so recently endured, she had never been in a true battle, and had zero experience next to Artemis' presumably long history.Politics, however, she could at least do. Some what. It also wasn't an area that she had studied at length, and it all the more made Arianne feel ashamed of how selfish she had been in her youth. Still, change began now.\"You're very kind, Madame Naoki. I suppose it would be even more foolish to continue pretending; Mrs. St. James is not my aunt, she is my sister, and I am who you think me to be; Arianne of Carmean, Queen of Gauldin. I would consider it a great personal favor if you would help my sister, niece, and I travel to Travere. I understand that much of the world thinks me dead; as you can see, I am not. I would prefer, however, that knowledge of my presence not be passed from mouth to mouth. There are things that need to be addressed with King Renaux before any knowledge of my survival should be made public.
