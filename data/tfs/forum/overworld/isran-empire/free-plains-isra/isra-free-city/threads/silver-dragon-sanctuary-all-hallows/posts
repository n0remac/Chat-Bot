The nobleman had requested an ornate, gilded sword and scabbard as a gift for his son, who was coming of age. Sturm took half of the payment up front to cover material cost, and the end product was quite possibly the most beautiful piece Sturm had ever created. The nobleman was so impressed that he blessed Sturm's name and paid more than his asking price. Weeks later, an invitation to this very party arrived at the Broza smithy.And so here Sturm finds himself, standing before the Silver Dragon Sanctuary, invitation in hand, a completely blank, white mask on his face, a similarly white dress shirt, white pants, and white gloves covering his normally soot-stained body.

Secure in the knowledge that he'd made his way inside unnoticed, he pulled off his right glove. Of course, there was no hand beneath, but that didn't bother him at all. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a slender woman's hand with red-painted nails. The hand grasped at his glove and twisted in his grip, but he shoved it into the empty cuff of his sleeve and pulled out of its grip with a practiced ease. Retrieving curved silver needle and a length of purple thread from within his coat, he stitched the hand carefully to his sleeve and tied it off with a deft knot. Flexing the fingers of his new hand, he repeated the process with his left glove, this time using a much larger man's hand with long, narrow fingers. He held his new appendages in front of his face, carefully inspecting his handiwork and giving a satisfied nod. These were skilled hands indeed, much more so than his own, and would serve him well tonight. Reaching deep into his coat, he produced an ornately engraved lute and headed off to mingle with the first arriving guests, his new hands striking up a lively tune.
