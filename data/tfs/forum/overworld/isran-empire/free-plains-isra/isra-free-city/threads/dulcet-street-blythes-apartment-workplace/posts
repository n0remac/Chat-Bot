It may be one of many, but it has something the others don\u2019t, something spectacular, something amazing, and something fantastic, that keeps bringing people back for more, not unlike the bakery below. It is the work place of one Fiona Blythe. After saving the life of a downtrodden carriage guard, the key to such an apartment found its way from his worn hands into the delicate palm of Fiona, and thus began a date with destiny. Initially it was a target for her nefarious ransacking ways, but the location proved perfect for something else entirely. Her home was always meant to be a closely guarded secret, no clients or lawmen would ever know about it, this kept her on the road. She finally has access to a small apartment in the middle of the city, dedicated to her craft of love making. Unbeknownst to her clients though, the beautiful courtesan doesn\u2019t only use the apartment to serve her clients, but it also serves as her headquarters in her service to the empire. Though the building itself has stood for a fair few years, and the hallways and stairs not nearly as delicate or fancy as the palace or high end district homes, it provides still provides a welcoming atmosphere, with fresh wallpaper, varnished wooden stairs, and light sconces that line the walls. Inside the apartment, however, is a different story. The old ratty wallpaper has been replaced with a white and red floral print, and the old skirting board entirely replaced. Carpets line the floors, and the curtains replaced with thick, black sheets of fabric. The main room itself has become the main attraction, featuring a bed between the two main windows, with soft sheets fluffy pillows, and a new mattress. At the far wall stands a divider, offering privacy for clients to prepare themselves. A writing desk, complete with Fiona\u2019s ledger and account book, a dresser, and a wardrobe along the walls, and at the end of the bed sits a lounger, should her clients prefer it. The apartment also features a second room, formerly the bedroom which has been changed into somewhat of a walk in wardrobe, featuring all of Fiona\u2019s outfits, from fancy dresses, to all sorts of lingerie, and even costumes, all for the benefit of her guests. It wouldn\u2019t be complete without a repair station, of course. Finally, the washroom, which has been completely redone after Fiona took over. The old metal bath, tattered sink, and wooden toilet have since all been replaced with the freshest white porcelain, and the new bath can now two comfortably. 4/191 Dulcet Street is open for business, so come down and experience a world you never thought you could. By Appointment Only.
