The first civilization to rise in the wake of The Cataclysm.\u201dThe man speaking seems to have a few years on our impressionable guard, as evidenced by his neatly cut beard and the wrinkles visible on his face. His helmet remains on his head, as per regulation. He strikes one as something of a veteran, one who has seen much and lived to tell about it.\u201cI was a member of its army. Served on many deployments and fought in Medan\u2019s defense against those who wished to see it crumble. \u2026 But the fatal blow was struck from within. In a coup led by one called Zephidel , The Venerable King Hylon Eremae was murdered, as was his son, Prince Evrand Eremae. Zephidel declared himself Lord of Goraia, and Medan was gone.\u201dThe intonation of his voice, especially as he mentions Zephidel, convey that the man has very strong feelings about the matter, but is keeping them reigned in in the interest of composure. \u201cI was, at the time, stationed at the northern border, and as thus, was able to escape along with some of my comrades and nearby citizens. We walked to Isra, where we were accepted with open arms and given what we needed to begin new lives. Since then, Lord Zephidel has disappeared and Empress Jill  has risen in his place, and the state of Goraia has committed multiple heinous atrocities. To begin with, they used the remains of the army and navy to sail to Sakand - that was city-state far down south - and seized it. Captured it in an act of war, killed whoever was in charge and put one of their own in charge. It has been their vassal since then. They have also treated their citizens as cattle. There are many rumors, and it\u2019s often hard to tell how much is exaggeration, but I hear that they work people to the death in the mines, practice slavery, utilise foul dark magics to affect the minds of their soldiers and defend their holdings, and either kill or put into prison any who oppose their rule.\u201dAt this point, he\u2019s almost spitting words and seems somewhat red in the face, gripping his spear very tightly.\u201cIt\u2019s despicable. Despicable and vile and awful and terrible in every way, both in an objective sense and to see a kingdom that was once so great, once my home, descend into the depths of that cruel, totalitarian regime. So much so that Lady Naoki has - after far too long - declared war, and invaded Medan with the intention of removing the Goraian government. Hasn\u2019t said what she intends to do with Medan after that, but she can\u2019t do much worse than those traitorous bastards have done.\u201d Here, he offers something of a shrug, though a very obviously angry, ruffled sort of shrug. \u201cBut we\u2019ve not the time to spend chatting, you. We\u2019ve got to stand here and look out over the plains for another four hours, watching for retaliation that those bastards are too scared to send, rather than fighting to retake Medan, chatting about world events with every minx that turns up, or doing anything productive with our time. So either present your papers, go see that Orville prick, or get to stepping.\u201dAt this, the younger guard shoots the elder a glare. He would very much like to continue chatting. This is the most interesting event to have happened so far today, will probably remain as such for the rest of the week, and Serafine is the most beautiful and immodestly dressed woman to have willingly come within five feet of him in absolute ages. Yet the elder guard, while not his direct superior, carries seniority and presents truth, to an extent that his superiors would likely side with the older if it came to any sort of dispute. The younger guard clenches and unclenches his left hand a few times, staring at her chest and trying to figure what all he should do, before - rather than saying anything - contorting his face in what he thinks to be a charming and roguish smile. In reality, many women might describe his facial expression it as \u2018rude\u2019, or \u2018off-putting\u2019, and may question if he might be about to vomit.

There\u2019s a woman, a comely and exotic one, at that, this close to him, touching his armor and calling him \u2018valiant\u2019 such. Close enough to smell, even. \u2026 Smells of bear, among other things. The senior guard rolls his eyes audibly and averts his gaze. Then the younger guard recovers somewhat, and tilts his head to the left, toward the interior of the gate. The gate\u2019s design is one of a standard sort, wherein there are a series of doors and portcullises are supported by two towers to either side, linked in the middle. Visible, there are two portcullises, one down, one up, and the bottoms of two wooden looking somethings. Likely doors that could be dropped. The whole thing is quite large in both height and width, wide enough to accommodate several carts side by side, and tall enough to fit all of the humanoids that have visited Isra to date.Additionally, there are two small, person sized doors on the side of the gate that is Serafina\u2019s left, one on the outside, and another on the inside, visible through the holes in the portcullis. They are very sturdy looking doors, of hard and thick wood, reinforced with metal in many places and, if Serafina has an ability by which she can sense magic, enchanted in some manner as well. It is to the nearer of these two doors that the young guard leads Serafina. It seems to be unlocked, as it pulls open by a strong pull alone. Within, there\u2019s something of a small and narrow hallway, leading across to what is presumably the wall of the structure of the gate. Against this wall, a wooden ladder is visible, leading upward. To the left, there is a wall. To the right, there is a single, decidedly less sturdy looking door roughly in the middle of the short hallway. Assuming that Serafina is still following her and her bear remains where it is, the younger guard leads inward, to the door, upon which he knocks. \u201cCome in,\u201d a voice sounds from within. It is the sort of voice that one might expect a professor or member of high society to have, with marked enunciation, a bit of an accent, and always one to say all of a word without slang or shortenings. Pushing the door inward with his left hand, the young guard stands facing Serafina, blocking the way further down the hall, but presenting the room for her to enter. He offers her a small sort of unsure smile as she comes back into his sight, but does not address her, rather speaking to his left, to the man in the room. \u201cA woman wishing to enter the city without paperwork, Mr. Orville,\u201d he presents her as such and continues to hold the door open. If Serafina were to continue forward and look into the room, she would see it to be, as stated, a small office. Its meager floorspace is dominated by a desk far too large for the room, sitting just to the right of the door. Behind it, a man sits in a chair, of the padded leather variety. The man, Orville, seems to be one of middling age, but one who has aged gracefully. No wrinkles marr his face and no gray hairs rest upon his head, the only manners by which one might think him to be as old as he is his beard - brown like his hair, unruly, and covering much of the bottom of his face and neck - and the look in his eyes. It\u2019s the sort of look that young people simply do not have, that conveys seniority and a supreme lack of care for how things go. He is wearing a doublet of black and silver and has a badge pinned near his lapel, bearing Isra\u2019s sun insignia and a second seal which is presumably that of the Ministry of Immigration.One might begin to wonder how he got behind the desk, as it stretches from wall to wall and there does not seem to be any sort of door back there. What is back there is actually a pair of small bookcases, both all but stuffed. One book sits on the desk, closed, but with the tassel of a bookmark protruding from the end. There does not seem to be any title on its visible face or the spine, it is simply bound in blue leather. Along with it on the desk is a candle, lit and one of the two sources of light in the room. The other source of light is a torch, hung in a sconce on the wall Orville is facing. Below it is a painting of high quality, but questionable content. It seems to depict a woman with nothing particularly interesting about her, dressed well and drawn in a flattering way, but otherwise without any defining characteristics. Someone important to Orville, perhaps. If Serafine proceeds to enter the room, Orville would beckon, suggesting that she seat herself in the low-backed seat opposite him, directly in front of the door.

Nobody liked getting a tongue-lashing on the best of days, especially in front of the travelers.\"Uh...her ears, sergeant?\"The sergeant nodded, picking up the coin between thick, sausage-like fingers and raising it up before the younger guard's face. Jenks looked at it, his eyes crossing as he tried to focus on the coin almost touching his nose.\"Her ears, Jenks. Cat\u00a0ears, specifically. The empress is a damn cat. With that in mind, Jenks, do you think that there are any laws against cats in the Empire?\"Jenks' eyes widened as he realized where the sergeant was going with this. Of course, it was so obvious! How had he been so dumb? He broke into an uneasy smile again, stepping around the sergeant to address the pair once more.\"I'm terribly sorry for the trouble,\" he said. \"I'm afraid cats aren't allowed. Imperial law. You'll have to leave them out here.\"After all, he thought smugly, cats were terribly territorial. It made sense that the empress wouldn't want any entering her land. He nodded to himself, glad that he was so smart, until the sergeant's hand lashed out and smacked him around the back of the head hard enough to spin his helmet backwards and make his ears ring.\"Get out of my sight, you stupid turnip-digger,\" growled the sergeant. \"You can forget about going on leave tomorrow, and I hope you like midnight patrols in the woods. No fires, no torches, march till dawn. Maybe you'll learn how to be less dumb.\"Turning towards the newcomers, he sighed and shook his head. As Jenks hurried off towards the guardhouse, he gestured towards the open gates with a wave of his hand.\"Please forgive his idiocy,\" he said. \"His mental abilities are not indicative of the guard as a whole. Your cats are absolutely permitted through the border, and you two are free to pass. Please enjoy your stay within Isra, and may the Empress' rein last a thousand years.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The scraggly guard glanced between the strange pair, wondering if the man was trying to make some sort of joke.
