One point of the pentagon juts towards the Citadel, at the heart of the city. Inside these walls sit buildings of all shapes and sizes, serving the legion different needs of every imaginable type of artisan, craftsman, or fabricator.These buildings are all dwarfed by the titular Dawnfire Forge itself. A structure easily rivaling both The Oculus Solis Arena and The Citadel in sheer size, the primary construction of the Forge is a series of five rigidly straight support beams, each sloping to the ground just inside the walls at a 45\u00b0 angle to support a face of what is quite possibly the largest single crystal you\u2019ll ever see - thirty meters from apex to apex, and approximately ten across.An elongated pentagonal dipyramid, the enormous gem suspended in the air serves as a unique sort of magical focus. The whole bulk of it has been enchanted for one singular purpose:  to absorb the rays of the sun itself. If one were to look upon it in the dark of a moonless night, lit by a torch or some other such artificial light, they would see that the crystal is quite clear. However, during the day, when the sun\u2019s light beats down upon it, the magic does its work, and the crystal appears as the darkest of blacks, that abyssal night that only exists in the complete absence of light.The absorbed light is projected downward from the bottom apex of the crystal in a blindingly bright white beam, through a series of focusing lenses, and into the heart of the forge below - a circular tower on top of a large pentagonal building occupying the center of the complex. There, through a series of complex and highly arduous smithing procedures, the light itself  is forged into metal. The resultant material is a pearlescent, vaguely golden metal that is warm to the touch, like the kiss of the sun on a warm summer\u2019s day. At the time of forging, it is exceptionally malleable and ductile, able to be formed and crafted with ease, so long as it remains exposed to light, even from an artificial source. Once exposed to darkness, the metal sets into a material so hard and durable that even the hottest forges of the dwarves would struggle to soften it. Sunmetal easily takes on enchantments related to light or fire, and is all but impossible to enchant with cold or darkness effects.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Occupying a large portion of Isra\u2019s northern side, the name of Dawnfire Forges refers not only to the monolithic Dawnfire Forge itself, but also to all of the associated buildings around it, forming a densely packed, yet simultaneously sprawling complex."}, "post-40669": {"user": "Forgemaster Epirus", "user_num": 1582, "timestamp": "1465349523000", "message": "Forgemaster Epirus looked over his new domain, satisfaction evident in his posture and the look in his eyes.

It\u2019s about a foot to a side, and the face of the cube that would have intersected with Naoki\u2019s forearm- had it been there, is absent. \u201c... Of creating shields of sorts. Watch this.\u201dMoving the gemstone into the palm of her left hand, Naoki raises her right, extending her fingers to press with the palm of her hand against the surface of the cube. Strangely enough, she doesn\u2019t seem to be able to use her right hand to touch her left no matter how much force she applies with the right, which stopped by the shield. Where the yellow light touches her skin, it shines more brightly, even cracking slightly.Moving onto the next demonstration, Naoki uses her right hand to pluck her bottle of ink off the desk, and carefully places it atop the cube. The transparent yellow light doesn\u2019t even so much as waver under the weight, easily suspending the bottle of ink in mid-air.\u201cShield,\u201d Naoki states, gesturing with her right hand to her left. After Epirus has had a moment or so to look at the thing, the cube of ethereal energy abruptly dissipates, which drops the bottle of ink right down into her open palm, and from there, smoothly back onto the desk. In the same motion, Naoki also places the gemstone before Epirus, leaving it there for his examination as she picks up her pad, re-inks her quill, and resumes drawing. \u201cWhat I would like is a suit of armor utilising gemstones like that one to provide protection to its wearer. It is possible to utilise multiple \u2018shields\u2019 in parallel if done carefully, or even use multiple gems to contribute to the same whole- again, if done carefully.\u201d\u201cThough such a thing has never- as far as I\u2019m aware, been done before, the concept that I\u2019m describing ought to provide a number of benefits over traditional armor that would make it an ideal alternative to the proper suit. Namely, not having to wear armor plates. Instead, one ought to be able to get away with\u2026 much less.\u201dWith that, Naoki turns her drawing pad for Epirus to see the progress. It depicts a woman who- at least so far, lacks any feline endowments, but is sporting a very flattering red dress. The dress is ornamented both with a pattern of flames and a few irregular and asymmetrical pieces of armor. A full left shoulderpad and breastguard, an elaborate neck, half of a right shoulder that extends down to cover the right elbow, a left gauntlet, some manner of plating on the right hip, and a very nice pair of matching boots. The woman also holds a sword, but it can be assumed that the sword is only there to balance the image artistically- Naoki has never exhibited or professed any degree of swordsmanship. \u201cThe idea being that the gemstones would be embedded into bits of armor spread across the body, and the wearer would be able to activate the shields as needed.\u201dWith that, Naoki stops, allowing Epirus to ponder the matter and articulate his thoughts at his leisure.

He hadn't realized it before as the blade was pristine but the grip, guard and pummel of the blade were quite filthy when he first brought it to the Forgemaster. Now it seemed that fresh leather was wrapped around the grip. The guard and pummel were entirely replaced with was seemed to be brass, or at least brass plated, ornate pieces. The pummel the Isran sun, with a inset ready to receive a round cut gem at the sun's heart. The guard featured fires extending out from a center crest that featured Isra's militant sigil all etched into the cross-guard with great detail. A pair of plates extended up from the pummel coating the edge and giving an extra hand grip above the pummel that better suited the common used of greatsword, a brilliant addition considering the blade's magical edge. Godfrey, after a moment of awe looking at the visible changes to the blade, pulled it from it's resting place. He gripped the sword with both hands rose it high and brought it down gently, getting a careful feel for it's balance. His eyes widened a bit. It was slightly heavy towards the tip when gripping the handle. He shifted his hands, gripping the blade above the pummel and he swung again. Perfect balance... He swung once more just to confirm. \"Forgemaster, I'm not one hundred percent sure what all you did to this blade, but this... It nears perfection. It's exquisite.\" There was still something to test. He asked the Forgemaster to make his sword a shield. Enchants were usually easy to use but Godfrey was quite inexperienced with enchanted weapons. Still he knew the theory... He closed his eyes and imagined putting himself into the blade, to fuel the enchantment. Much to his surprise the blade responded to his attempts. The feeling was like a black hole sucking out Godfrey's energy, evidence of both the quality of the enchantment and Godfrey's inexperience with magic. He opened his eyes and beheld a opaque construct of magic that emanated from the sword. It was limited and small but it was there. Like a brick wall that wasn't finished. Godfrey's brows furrowed and his eyes narrowed in an effort to maintain the magic. Then, like a wisp of smoke, it was gone.\u00a0Sweat beaded upon his brow, \"That will take some practice...
