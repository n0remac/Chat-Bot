These cells are slightly more comfortable than the rooms for the general population, but they are still aggressively spartan in design. A bed, little more than a cheap wooden frame with ropes strung to support a rough hay mattress, a stone latrine in the corner, and a single bare shelf decorate the room. Here, the long term residents who have proved cooperative with their captors find themselves housed for more gentle questioning. Two guards remained stationed in this wing today.

Of all the things in this world, she seemed to be the only one that was a solid fixture.

The frigid water caused her skin to tingle and smart sharply. With this came some semblance of being more awake.A rough towel dried her face. If only she had been able to nap at her desk just a few moments longer. A serious idea to bed down in one of the empty cells had passed her mind, but Iulia had fallen asleep at her desk before she could carry out that plan. At some point, a fellow investigator had kindly draped a coat over her shoulders. Too bad she had fallen asleep on one of her pens; the impression of it is still slightly visible under her left eye.The black kid gloves slide back onto her hands, covering the scars across her knuckles and fingers. Iulia elects to keep her shirt sleeves rolled up, showing off her well-toned arms. Pleasant warmness from slumber is fast fading as Iotapa makes one last check of her appearance. While not vain, per say, Iulia respects the critical importance of one\u2019s outward presentation. A few last strands of hair are tucked back under her cap as the investigator whirls on her heel and begins at a brisk walk towards the west wing, her scarlet skirts swishing softly as she speeds along.The office is more lively now that it is later in the day. She stops by her desk briefly to pick up her papers for Decker and the Fae to read over and sign. Investigators are hard at work on their own cases, new prisoners are checked in to their cells as others are released or transferred out of The Square. Ideally, Decker and the Fae will be awake by now, Iulia thought.This was not yet the case. Iulia peered through the bars separating the sleeping Fae and fireman from her before unlocking the door. Physical closeness like that between the two bedridden forms had never really sparked the investigator\u2019s imagination. It looked so impractical and uncomfortable. Where do you put your arms? What happens if one of you has to get up in the night? Loose strands of Kaelie\u2019s hair splayed over Decker's cheek, and the big fireman looked somewhat crammed into the tiny jail bed.In the back of Iulia\u2019s mind, what had happened between these two soured. Had Decker had used his position of authority and power to sleep with this woman? A louder portion of her mind shut this thought down rapidly. No, it said, Decker did what he had to do in order to help his city. He simply used the tools available to him for a good purpose. What he did was his duty to his city and a kindness to the Faerie.Iulia supposed it was like her usage of magic in her job. She might not have a shred of connection to thaumaturgical energies, but she appreciated the utility of magic in daily life. Not having to rely on fickle candles or pens that run out of ink was nice. The runes and charms that protected The Square and made containing dangerous criminals even possible were to be used to their fullest extent and respected. Decker\u2019s actions helped the city, and that was that.On the tiny table still sat Iulia\u2019s note to Decker, untouched. At least he is awake, if still trapped under his... bedfellow? Her mind mentally hesitates over thinking of them as such. She nodded towards the paper before quietly creeping over to the side of the bed and unfolding and passing over it for Decker to read.

Her grey Breton cap is resettled on her head, no longer listing dangerously off to one side.She arrives at the cell and raps sharply on the bars before unlocking the door and entering.\u201cHello again.

Prisoner 494, you are to be remanded to the custody of Fire Chief Montag Decker for an indefinite period of time, or until the end of your mortal life. Whichever comes first.\u201dIulia pulls out a large piece of parchment and slides it over to Decker, for both prisoner and fireman to read it if they so choose. The investigator gives them a brief overview.\u201cThe terms are as follows: Prisoner 494 will be bound magically to Montag Decker. This will be accomplished by a pair of magical devices currently being constructed by The Enclave. The prisoner and Mr Decker are not permitted to ever remove these devices for any reason under penalty of indefinite incarceration. The prisoner is not permitted to use any magicks without express permission from Mr Decker, nor is the prisoner allowed free roam of any land owned, occupied, or otherwise controlled by the Isran Empire, unless accompanied by Mr Decker. So long as the prisoner doesn\u2019t violate any of the above provisions, Isra will not harass her in any way. She will be allowed to live her life as normally as possible.\u201dThe arrangement goes into further details concerning Decker acting as Kaelie\u2019s warden, as well as outlining several provisions concerning what would happen if either of the signers violated their agreement. Suffice to say that non-compliance would meet with a swift arrest and transfer to Mazorana Maximum Security Prison.\u201cAll you need to do is sign at the bottom of the parchment there. There are two dotted lines. The top one is for you, Mr Decker, and the bottom one is for you.\u201dIulia glances at the Fae while holding a pen out for Decker to take.\u201cAre there any questions? Please do note that if you choose not to sign, the alternative is to remain here in this cell awaiting further orders from the judge.

You benefit directly by continuing to live, I don\u2019t really see how I can explain that in any simpler terms. As for your home, the provisions for that are in this second agreement here. We can get to that after we secure your release. That way we are dealing with you as a Fae, not a prisoner. A treaty protecting your forest must be between a foreign agent and the Isran government. Such an agreement could not be enforced between a prisoner and the state. Listing you as Montag\u2019s ward will grant you more recognition before our laws.\u201dTaking a step back was the best course of action at this point. A calm explanation of the law, rather than trying to force the Fae into an agreement, could smooth this over. Iulia just hoped that basic legal concepts like standing and legal personhood could be understood by Kaelie.\u201cRight now, you are defined as an alien prisoner. Citizen prisoners have some rights during their incarceration, alien prisoners have basically none. By having Decker act as your warden, a protector of sorts, you move from being a prisoner to a person recognized by the law. We can then have you be involved in a foreign treaty between Isra and your forest, protecting it against further logging and Isran intrusion.\u201dIulia felt like a law professor with a classroom of first-year students. Every word had to be chosen carefully for maximum clarity and impact. The law was dense and complicated. That did not mean it had to be incomprehensible.\u201cNow, I can\u2019t just let you go without some form of punishment. Our laws serve to protect Isra and her people. You hurt a lot of people. The fires you started burned blocks of property and damaged the livelihoods of many citizens. Though you do not care about that, the law does. That means I have to care as well. The law binds me to protect the people by enforcing its dictates. You have to be held to account for your crimes, regardless of how you feel on the matter. If I fail to enforce the law here, I fail the very oath I took as an officer of the Guard.\u201dIulia remembers back to her father teaching her about responsibility. She had taken her brother\u2019s practice shield outside to use as a makeshift snow shovel. A few hours of play in, and she was sledding down a snowy hill with the shield. One particularly bad run saw the shield bent around a tree. Her punishment had been learning to hammer the shield back into its original shape, then polishing it to a perfect shine after every one of her brother\u2019s practice sessions. Every action has an outcome, and every actor must take ownership of that.\u201cThe kindest plan is to have the powers you used to perpetrate massive destruction bound to the one who has the most direct role in combating exactly what you tried to do. Montag Decker is a fireman. He understands magic, fire, and you, it seems. I wouldn\u2019t call your custody \u2018slavery\u2019. We aren\u2019t pressing you into service or requiring you to work for us. An option I had was your execution, or giving you a life sentence. That would solve our immediate problems with little fuss.\u201dThe image of the Fae learning of Kaelie\u2019s fate and descending en masse to seek retribution impressed itself into Iulia\u2019s imagination. Her actions here could lead to a war. A deal with Kaelie might save Isra a lot of trouble in fending off a Fae attack.\u201cI\u2019d like to avoid that, however. By signing this agreement, Isra recognizes you as someone we can make a treaty with concerning your home. Decker will supervise and protect you, not use you as cheap labor or something unseemly.\u201dShe breaks off to give Decker a cold stare before continuing.\u201cSo long as you don\u2019t try to set fire to buildings, attempt to kill people, or otherwise break Isran law, you will be fine. The Guard won\u2019t trouble you, the authorities will leave you alone.\u201dA beat. Outside, a bird sings as it flies by the iron barred window.\u201cOnly after we sign this can we move on to dealing with your home. I promise that, should you sign our first agreement, I can secure the protection of your forest. My signature is already on the first agreement. But we cannot move on to the second if you stay a prisoner.\u201dThe bird wings away from the window and silence returns. Iulia glances at Kaelie and shrugs.\u201cThere is an alternative.

The anger tears that had been bunching in the corners of her eyes finally spilled over, dripping onto the ground with heavy plops as Kaelie fell back against the wall, feeling her knees grow weak with the gravity of the knowledge that set in.She had been outmaneuvered.

Her black Breton hat and long coat finish the outfit.A few moments later, Iulia stands with Dixie outside The Square.\u201cYou asked about horses a while ago, Miss Starr. For the most part, how you get around will be determined by where you are posted. I primarily walk everywhere, but quite a few of us either take a horse or carriage to further away scenes. And speaking of.\u201dIulia gestures towards a large carriage, drawn by six horses, rounding the street corner into view. It stops for the two women to jump aboard before taking off at a rapid clip.The carriage weaves its way through the crowded streets of The Free City. It is just after noon, so the populace of Isra was out in full force going about their daily business. Many people seem to be making their way towards The Midnight Sun in an effort to gawk at the carnage. The Investigator shakes her head and turns away from the window towards her companions.Along with Dixie, there are four others riding along. Each one looks grimly around the carriage, talking in low tones about the explosion. Iulia clears her throat and addresses them all over the sound of the cobblestones passing beneath.\u201cAfternoon, all. Before we get to the matter at hand, I\u2019d like to introduce you to Miss Dixie Starr. Miss Starr is a hopeful applicant to The Officer of Investigations and will be taking part in our efforts today. Treat her like you would any of your fellow guards. Miss Starr, these are Officers Jenkins, Highchurch, and Larimer from the Office of Investigations, and Magus Arthur from The Enclave.\u201dMagus Arthur gives Dixie a half smile before turning her attention back to a large pendant. Her mouth moves, reciting silent incantations. The other three members of Investigations each extend a hand for Dixie to shake. Jenkins and Highchurch look to be polar opposites. Whilst Jenkins is a thin elvin man with obvious poise, grace, and above average skills with eyeliner, Highchurch is a rough lump of a human with thick features, a cauliflower ear, and all the markings of an accomplished bar fighter. Officer Larimer, a halfling woman, rounds the trio out, sitting on the edge of her seat with a set of charcoal pencils and a sheaf of parchments. Her hands are already colored black by her pencils. Against potentially better judgement, she is idly sketching away on a scrap piece of parchment, allowing the natural bumps of the road to add haphazard flourishes to her drawing. \u201cNow, the Fire Department is already at the scene with a few members of The Guard who were initially called out to the explosion. We have most of the block partitioned off, but I\u2019ll have you, Jenkins and Highchurch make a quick go round to make sure everything is locked down tight. We don\u2019t want any of the well meaning public to go traipsing through the scene.\u201dThe two officers nod.\u201cLarimer and Miss Star, you two will be with me. Our first stop will be with Fire Chief Montag Decker to get his account. There are a few witnesses who survived the explosion that we will talk to afterwards. In particular, Larimer, I\u2019d like some sketches of the site of the explosion itself.\u201d\u201cMagus Arthur. I\u2019ll leave you to your own work, but please let me know the minute you find anything out about the nature of our explosion. I doubt I have to tell you, but we are particularly concerned about this being a magical attack.\u201dIn her mind, Iulia hoped this was an awful accident of some sort. Maybe a magical lantern had overloaded, or one of those alchemical cocktails backfired stupendously. It wasn\u2019t likely that a small accident had blown out the front of the tavern. If this were another attack against Isra, like that Fae\u2019s attempt to burn down several city blocks, what would The Guard do?Larimer and Magus Arthur chat briefly about the last time they had visited The Midnight Sun.

A barricade set up across the narrow street draws a line between the scene at The Midnight Sun and the growing throngs of people in the road. There are easily a hundred, if not more, people milling about. The horses at the front of the cart whiny and snort as they stomp the pavement with apprehension.

I heard hatred and fear and desperation, all of which were leveled against the very country I have sworn to protect. It was frightening.\u201dA pause. Outside, a guard yells for a small group of young men to step away from the barricade. There is a tension in the air, a feeling of anxiety and perverse curiosity hidden beneath the surface.\u201cEver since then, the various Offices of The Guard have been on high alert. We are concerned with copycat attacks. This Fae wasn\u2019t radicalized by an anti-Isra group. She developed her hate all by herself.

There are loads of people, entire parts of the city, who are just as filthy and mean as they were back home. It's all just hidden under a thin layer of gold leaf, squirreled away so it doesn't offend the eyes of the well-to-do. As for what I do when I'm not working, well...not much at all.

Her time in The Square has been cut down dramatically upon being forced into leading the Imperial Vizier's task force. Usually, she only has time to stop by her corner office to drop off parchments, make a brief report or two, and take a short nap on her desk. In between her work with The Guard, this blasted task force, and griffin riding lessons, she had no time for anything in the way of leisure. Her hair had started to grow out farther than she had ever let it, tangling its way around her Breton cap and falling in her eyes in the most infuriating way. Most of her casework is done out on the town, alongside the seemingly endless list of tasks sent to her directly from the Vizier.

Licorice root tea supposedly works to help calm the stomach, and so the Investigator has taken to downing it greedily.It was odd that the recent arrests are billed as Iulia\u2019s work. Her only involvement was enforcing already penned order. Granted, the people in question had not been easy to find or bring in. \u201cOfficers Larimer and Highchurch were instrumental in helping bring in the most recent five suspects in. My questioning of each has proven enlightening in a few regards. There has long been some amount of disapproval amongst the older population regarding Empress Naoki\u2019s rise to power.

A large number of the people in question lived near or on Moloch Street, with a few of them even residing in public houses near The Midnight Sun.

The images come and go, almost melding together in a blur, but some come through though obscured, like peering through dirty glass. She could see a hooded figure running away with a bag of coins, but he was getting closer again\u2026 no, she was getting closer to him. There\u2019s a muffled yell, and suddenly she could see her own fists pummelling him, her throat raw with sickness and rageful screaming, something about a thief. The words are lost to the memories of pain that lance through her chest, fists, and feet. Muffled voices follow as her dream goes foggy and her vision swirls around her. There must be\u2026 two? No\u2026 three voices. Two men and one woman, but the woman is familiar. In the woman\u2019s sickness-plagued dream, she couldn\u2019t recognise her own voice as she pleads with two towering, imposing figures. More pain. More yelling. The Isran crest is the only thing that comes forward as her vision shifts to see the thief stumbling away, then a bloody, outstretched hand thrusting forward, then gripping at the painfully cold snow. Suddenly she\u2019s upright. The world had changed again, but her body ached even more. She could barely feel one of her feet, the dream had finally granted her a small mercy, but the other felt so cold. Her head felt heavier than an iron bar as she looks down, seeing her own feet shuffling through the snow, one now bare. What had happened to her boot? She had to search through so many garbage piles for that boot\u2026 There are other feet, both wearing thick, lightly plated boots. Oh what she wouldn\u2019t do for a pair of good boots. When was the last time she had a good pair? Her memory goes fuzzy as she\u2019s whisked off her feet. The world goes blurry again, but a lance pain still shoots up her hands. She found herself staring at bricks and iron bars, and she\u2019s shouting something. There\u2019s a man on the ground, just as ratty as herself, holding his nose, while another cowers back. Where has the dream taken her now? What is this place? She feels something gripping at her upper arm, but she can\u2019t fight it. Instead, she collapses, straining against something as she holds herself up on her palms, then the sound of liquid on rock fills the air, followed by a coughing fit that forces her onto her side. Hallways. More hallways. Shouting. Is it her shouting? It sounds like her. She can\u2019t move her arms or legs, something\u2019s very wrong. The dream creates nightmarish faces as she passes them, is she being held up? Dragged? She feels like she\u2019s floating on water, but somehow upside down and inside out. A door opens by itself in front of her and she feels picked up almost. One of her legs moves! Then the other! She can actually feel again, just in time for her frozen foot to get caught, but she doesn\u2019t fall. Instead the cold, rocky floor seems to shift, then fly straight at her face! She is suddenly awoken by a coughing fit, the pain becoming real all of a sudden. Her face scrunches up as the coughs rip at her chest, gross and wet to the ear. Some might consider being awoken from her nightmares a mercy, but the reality isn\u2019t much better. She slowly cracks open one emerald eye as she shifts the blanket from her face, trying to make heads or tails of what happened, but her thoughts are cut short by another fit of sickly coughs. The woman spits out a blob of cloudy mucus-y phlegm before she collapses back onto the old, hard bed. \u201cNot like this\u2026\u201d she groans as she covers her face, wet with a slick coating of cold sweat. When was the last time she felt well? It must have been a month. She curls up and rolls onto her side before another cough takes her. Thank the merciful gods for blankets, she thinks to herself as she pulls the smelly rag tight around her. She still feels the biting cold, but at least it was tolerable, unlike the freezing hold of the cold, golden shackle around her left ankle, one to match the iron one around the other. \u201cHello?\u201d she calls out, her voice groggy and thick.

She lets out a handful of coughs, then blocks one nostril to shoot out a tendril of disgusting, cloudy mucus out the other, straight onto the bench. \u2018Take that, assholes,\u2019 she thinks to herself in her clouded mind. If this little man isn\u2019t here to kill her, then he can enjoy her sickness as much as she is. Slowly, and dizzily, she gets to her feet and lets the blanket fall off her. Her clothes are torn and messy, with her shirt buttons mostly missing except for one or two in the middle, which let the shirt slide off one of her shoulders. She either doesn\u2019t notice or doesn\u2019t care that one of her smaller breasts is no longer covered, and matches the pale, filthy skin all over the woman. The only thing pretty about the image is the small, muddy, golden hoop through her sad, dark nipple, that clings to the previously white fabric. Her pants are torn down the sides and stained with dirt and mud from weeks of living in the gutter. Its best not to look too closely. Her one boot is without laces or buckles, with its tongue flopping with each shift, and her other foot looks almost black with mud, dried blood, and perhaps even a hint of hypothermia. Above it though is possible the most notable part of her sorry appearance, the golden shackle around her ankle doesn\u2019t seem to be very dirty at all, as if most of it just slipped straight off of it. The woman wobbles on her dizzy feet before stifling a handful of coughs, then she steps to the bars. The classic jail routine, she\u2019d be lying if she said she\u2019d never done it before. Usually it was just a small town jail where she woke up after one hell of a bender. Last time it was something about sleeping with the mayor\u2019s wife? Or was it the mayor\u2026 or both? She couldn\u2019t remember, but the thoughts are cut off after she extends her palms and feels the pain shoot up her arms. Her hands look worse for wear, especially her bloodied knuckles from one too many fights and living rough on the streets. Thankfully she had wiped her hands on the blanket, as the only remnants of her sickness seem smeared, if any at all.

More often than not, the soldiers ended up coming down with the very illnesses that they were trying to contain.His musings were cut short when he realized that he'd been staring at the little golden ring, his face flushing red as he looked quickly away. The shining gold of the piercing and the ankle bracelet looked startlingly out of place in the grimy cell, and he wondered if they were even allowed in the prison. Surely such valuables were supposed to be confiscated? Of course, everyone had heard stories of unscrupulous jailers pocketing valuables to sell for personal profit, but such a crime was unthinkable to Assistant Jailer Third Class Twill. Stooping to such abuses of power would fly in the face of everything the Guard stood for, and he would never be promoted if he displayed anything short of impeccable moral character. Of this, Barnaby was sure.\"You're allowed bread and water,\" he said. \"Water shall be clear enough to see a copper coin at the bottom of a horse trough and bread shall be aged no less than three and no more than nineteen days as per Isran Jail Regulation One-one-oh-two-dash-four. Healers allowed only for immediately life-threatening conditions as detailed under Regulation One-one-one-six-dash-nine. Also, you'll have to hand over all of your jewelry you've got there. The one on your ankle and the...uh...ahem...the one on your, er...that golden ring. They will be kept for safekeeping and returned upon release.\"He gestured vaguely towards her chest, face burning. Why hadn't whoever brought her in taken them? He supposed that such decorations were probably difficult to confiscate, but they had rules for a reason! He would know, he'd read the book of regulations cover to cover at least three times. This particular rule was to prevent bribery of guards or trading with other inmates, although he knew as well as anyone that it was frequently abused. Picking up a bucket of water from the bench behind him, he unlocked the door and slid the bucket across the floor to the prisoner.\"Wash your face off,\" he said, \"and for goodness sake cover yourself up.

After the prisoner is finished, The Empress is silent for a long moment, her face unreadable.Naoki then abruptly turns her attention to the pouch on her hip, in which she begins to rummage. \u201cWarden! Open this door! Release my sister.\u201dThe warden does a double take but rushes to comply. \u201c...Y-yes, your Highness.\u201dAs the warden is fumbling with his keyring, Naoki finds what she\u2019s looking for and extends her gloved hand through the bars to offer it to Andrea. It is a small gemstone, smaller than one\u2019s smallest fingernail, of a muddy reddish-pink sort of color. Amethyst, or perhaps garnet, polished into a marble.\u201cIt is a curative. Swallow it whole and sit back down.\u201dCrafted long ago by Naoki\u2019s best artificer, the magic imbued in the gemstone is far more powerful than its size might imply. Once inside an individual -- by whatever means, the curative magics trigger violently, repairing tissue, expunging infection, eradicating disease, and potentially even regrowing lost digits. They were intended for use in situations where one may have sustained an otherwise-fatal blow, and the healing magic is entirely indiscriminate. Naoki was told that it is not necessarily an altogether pleasant experience to be healed in such a manner, but it doesn\u2019t take long and is obviously preferable to the alternative. Fortunately, in the years since, Naoki has never had cause to use one, so she doesn\u2019t know what it might be like. Part of the reason she offers it to Andrea now is simply to see it work, and the other part is that she isn\u2019t inclined to NPC call for a healer.Because it seems like there\u2019s an awful lot wrong here. Not only with Andrea herself, not only with her health, but the ramifications of this new development are many and complex. This is a time of much stress for Naoki, and finding out that one of her \u2018sisters\u2019 survived is not helping matters. Frankly, Naoki would just like to go home and curl up with something warm for a nap, but it doesn\u2019t seem as though that\u2019s in the cards for today.

She commanded such fear? Andrea figured it would be more respect. Then again, only cowards seemed to show fear instead of respect when it came to powerful figures. Perhaps the warden is more mouse than man after all. Sister, though? Perhaps that had been something she had tried very hard to forget. Perhaps it\u2019s just the term for who she is to Naoki. Andrea didn\u2019t care, and didn\u2019t even try to make sense of it, because if the empress says you\u2019re her sister, then you\u2019re her goddamn sister, if only to get your freedom. They could iron out the details later. Did that imply family? Did Andrea have, or even need family? Hm. Still, when ordered, she sits up and stumbles to the bars once again and takes the gem. She looks it over, then to Naoki with a sleepy, but curious look in her eye. If Naoki had wanted to poison her, why would she be releasing her? That didn\u2019t make sense. Perhaps it really is a curative. It would be a win-win anyway, either she\u2019d be cured, or she\u2019d die, and at this stage of her sickness she didn\u2019t care which one. She sits down and looks it over one more time, then looks up to Naoki. \u201cSee you on the other side\u2026 sis.\u201d With that, she swallows the little gem. It only takes a few seconds before she could feel something. There\u2019s a warm sensation in her belly, one she hadn\u2019t felt in months that seemed to kill the nauseating feeling, but then it grew warmer and seemed to spread through her body. She began to shake, from her hands at first, then it quickly travels up her arms and only seems to stop when she crosses her arms in front of her. Her stomach is beginning to burn from the heat, and she curls over in an effort to stop it, but it doesn\u2019t seem to help at all, and the burning had begun to spread up through her torso and up into her throat. The woman collapses onto the ground, shuddering and almost convulsing as the magic scrubs and scrapes away every little bit of sickness from her body, killing any hint of the virus from her blood stream, blood vessel by blood vessel in an exceptionally painful manner. She gurgles and coughs as the burning spreads through her lungs, expunging the infestation from every nook and cranny and driving it from her lungs. She rolls twice as her legs jerk, until she finds herself on her knees, shaking and shuddering, looking down at the ground. With several tremendous coughs, she expels the infection from her lungs in a very unpleasant display of phlegm, dried blood, and who knows what else, which is soon followed by her helplessly grabbing a bucket that had been placed for a completely different purpose. She didn\u2019t care, as not a second after she had gotten it under her did she expel everything from her stomach, pushed up and out by the magic of the gemstone. She breathes heavily as the heat of the gemstone begins to dissipate, clearing and scrubbing the last of the infection.For once, her nose, throat, and mind seemed so much clearer, but at what cost? The room now stank and she desperately needed a good wash and possibly new clothes, as it seemed the infection hadn\u2019t purged everything from one end. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 gonna need a new set of rags\u2026\u201d she says as she looks up, then goes wide eyed before coughing once more, this time coughing up the gem which had lost any sort of glow, fully used up. She stands and looks at her hands which were no longer bloodied, now just dirty. \u201cAm I alive?\u201d she asks, her voice seems much clearer now. \u201cI\u2026 feel alive.
