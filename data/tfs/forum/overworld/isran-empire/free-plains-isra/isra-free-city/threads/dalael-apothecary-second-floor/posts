He managed to ease open his eyes just a crack and was met with the top of Alystin's head, her stark white hair cutting off half his sight. As he came to bit by bit he began to regain feeling through his body, though he was stiff in several places. But he found out why - his entire form was snuggled right upon that of his beloved... his mate. One arm was cramped up under the pillow under his head, but the other was wrapped firmly around her waist and holding her close. One leg was lying alongside her own with the other draped over them - he created the most warm and protective barrier she might want.But it wasn't her warmth that stirred him... no, it was the sunlight peeking in through the windows and spilling onto the sheets.He shifted a bit where he lay, and a long and low grunt rumbled through his chest when he realized just how stiff his limbs were... and what else was stiff. And his hips were pressed right up against her own from behind. He opted to lay right there save for a propping his head up on his arm after pulling it free of the pillow mountain. From there he could see their blanket had been kicked to the foot of the bed, and marvel at her lovely figure laid bare to his eyes. She was absolutely beautiful, from her gorgeous skin to the perfect curves that marked her gender to the stray locks of snowy hair left in a lovely mess thanks to the night prior.Those little bits of memories began to trickle into his thoughts and a wide, devious grin slipped across his expression. She had been dying for more - he had pushed limits to please her, but with no complaint. He enjoyed every second of their passion. Somehow they made it from the couch to the bedroom without waking Elianara. It was a greater miracle they hadn't woken her, that he knew of. They had been... very well engaged for a portion of the night.It struck him with an idea. His hand moved from her waist up her body and deliberately over one of the lush mounds at her chest, before running up her neck. Fingertips gingerly brushed over her face and then teased her lips, as if to give the impression that he was there to kiss. After a bit of this his hand returned over the path along her body, making sure to drive the sensuality as possible, and then completed the cycle by moving north again. All the while, he leaned in close to gently nibble along the length of her ear, certain to get her attention with this. And, as if this pleasurable torment wasn't enough, he was happy to buck his hips up on the occasion to give her a good prod from behind.

But he continued to explore her mouth was painfully slow motions of his tongue, tilting his head to deepen the embrace and taste every inch of her lovely mouth.<br><br/>That stray hand of his moved down, palm gently pressed to her side with fingers just barely feathering over the fabric of her dress. The pressure was subtle - just a simple tease for now as she drew further down along her, over the lovely curve of her hip and down her thigh. He found the hem of her dress and gathered the edge of the fabric in his fingers, taking just as long to draw the soft cotton across her skin and bare the flesh. He would push it up well over her hips, letting it bunch up just below her bust to reveal her stomach and everything below.<br/><br/>And his fingertips began to trace a familiar trail up and down her side, occasionally turning inward to carefully brush his palm over her belly and the inner thighs. Meanwhile, a deep chuckle rumbled in his chest that betrayed his desire to play naughty, rippling through his lips to hers as he continued to dominate. Here, it was all about driving her crazy - and pushing her limits. He knew she was ticklish - and was certainly trying to play on that as well as her excitement. Watching her squirm was always enticing.</br></font>"}, "post-37269": {"user": "Alystin Dalael", "user_num": 1144, "timestamp": "1462946443000", "message": "Alystin bucked up against him with a whimper as he teased her.

When he slowly stirred he let out a grumble, shifting much like he did every morning up to this point. A hungry growl of the tiger rumbled throughout his entire being as his hips shifted against her in a wanting manner. He enjoyed waking her this way, with gentle nibbles and kisses - and a demand for attention rocking against her own body.It hadn't even been quite a week, and yet this felt natural - like this was his life from day one. He was happy. Just her smile made him want to do a back flip. Talking with her made him feel warm inside and out. Her laughter was akin to church bells in sterling clarity. Her desires made him feel more and more at home with fur and without. He was bold enough to say she completed him - she was the missing puzzle piece in the canvas of his life.
