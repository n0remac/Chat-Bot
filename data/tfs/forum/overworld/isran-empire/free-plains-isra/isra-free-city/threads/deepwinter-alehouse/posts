The building was claimed by the banks and sat uninhabited for quite a while before it was quietly purchased by a minor noble. It now stands with iron bars on the windows and has been repainted moderately well. The oak door and frame are reinforced with iron bands and secured with a masterwork lock. The interior of the tavern space is still quite nice, if neglected, with richly colored cherry wood flooring and wall panels. Off to the side stands a large stone hearth, and hanging above it is a large shield painted with a family crest of a wolf howling at an eclipsed moon. Spaced around the room are oak support pillars engraved with scenes from stories of the old world and battles of yore.The main room has been somewhat converted into a training space with several dummies stood around in various poses and several mostly empty weapon racks line one wall. The few weapons that aren\u2019t made of wood are of fairly low quality and probably wouldn\u2019t be much use outside of sparring. Most of the few remaining tables and chairs are pushed up against the walls and the second floor is accessible by twin spiral  staircases winding around two of the engraved pillars. At the back of the room stands formerly polished mahogany countertop set above faded yet still beautifully painted panels. Past the counter is a door that leads to what once was the staff room, which has been converted into a maintenance room, and the kitchen. All in all, it doesn't quite feel like a home. A cursory glance notes absence of almost any accents or nick-nacks which makes the simple chair and table arrangement with a single glass feel lonely, even when the large hearth is alight.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Near the outer edge of the city stands a two story building that was once a tavern of some repute before the owner disappeared under mysterious circumstances.
