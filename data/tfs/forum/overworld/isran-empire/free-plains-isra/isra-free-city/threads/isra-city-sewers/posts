Hmm...As it slurped along, eventually it came across several piles of bones. *Squick*?The creature liked bones and was low on calcium. Its form slobbered all over them. The bones would dissolve into a gooey, rubbery pile as the blob released acid from its slimy body. Then it would slurp up the bones. It repeated this process with every pile until, finally, it hit the mother load, an actual dead body!*Squick*! This was perfect, much better than the old rat. The blob glooped its way all over it, releasing peptin and other enzymes to help digest the meat. However, it was careful to keep some of the structure so that it could really learn from it. It absorbed muscle strands and organs into itself and kept them whole while it doted over them and \"studying\" them. It was akin to a child rolling around a gumball in her mouth with her tongue, trying to guess the flavor.The best part was the brain. All those nerve bundles helped the blob feel better, gave it more awareness, almost like a drug. The dying flesh of the brain had lost most of its memories and constructs, but certain emotions like pleasure and lust, and certain neurotransmitters, survived.The brain made the blob feel loved. With enough brainpower it could actually feel nostalgia and longing over memories which otherwise only existed as RNA strands floating around in its form.
