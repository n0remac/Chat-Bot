{"post-81995": {"user": "The Vallon Gang", "user_num": 2995, "timestamp": "1524335866000", "message": "The GarrisonExteriorOff to the eastern side of Isra, not far from the walls themselves, lies The Garrison in the middle of an unpaved square. Horse-drawn carts came and went, dropping off piles of stones so workers paid by the Vallons could labor meticulously to lay them into the ground, starting with the sidewalk wrapping around the wooden tavern. It would be months before the project was done and, in the meantime, patrons would have to walk in the hoofprint-covered dirt and mud.Just outside of the tavern, underneath the overhead balcony above the door, which was marked with the Red Right Hand, were two small round tables surrounded by three plain wood chairs each for any patrons that preferred the fresh air over the\u00a0no doubt smoke-filled interior. A blonde server, hired as much for her assets as for her serving skill, flitted in and out whenever customers lounged outside, taking care of their needs. By the front door, guarding it, stood a Thug dressed in a dark dirty cloak and wearing the distinctive Vallon Gang bycocket felt hat with two hidden razors sewn into it. On his right hip was an oak cudgel with a multitude of small pointed steel studs embedded in the top, and, on his left hip in a plain leather scabbard, was a basic straight short sword made of steel.If one were observant enough, they\u2019d notice another man similarly dressed and armed sitting on a wooden barrel across the street, reading a couple leaflets and back resting nonchalantly against the wall of the neighboring business. If one were even more observant, they\u2019d see the Thug was merely using the parchments clutched in his hands as cover as he carefully watched the streets for trouble and the comings and goings of everyone.Two more Vallon Gang thugs/guards stood atop the large balcony, each looking in the opposite direction and armed with small crossbows.InteriorMain Room:Through the front door and past the guard is the main area of the once rundown tavern. It has since been repaired and fixed up by the gypsies in the year they\u2019ve owned it, turning it into a well kept up and cozy area for their patrons to lounge and relax. During the early hours and afternoon, other than some Vallons, the tavern is fairly empty with the odd customer here and there, but, in the evening, the place is much more lively and packed. The majority of patrons are usually loyal to the Vallon Gang, but all are welcome so long as they abide by the laws of the turf.Several rectangle and square tables made of cheap pine dot the area, each with matching pine chairs lacking any form of cushioning. The long bar is to the right of the main entrance; the counter\u2019s surface had many scratches and notches, but was regularly kept waxed and cleaned. As was most of the tavern. Despite the cheap furniture(a situation that will eventually be remedied), The Garrison was well kept by the serving girls and bartender, each under the careful supervision and orders of Almorlin Da'Lael, the manager of the tavern\u2019s legal side of the business. The hardwood floors were kept swept and mopped, ashtrays and spittoons were emptied regularly, and the iron fittings of the hanging lanterns and wall sconces scrubbed and dried to prevent rust buildup.To the rear of the main room was a small room that serves as Almorlin Da'Lael\u2019s office, and the stairs leading up to the upper level where the bedrooms were, and John Vallon\u2019s personal office and access to the balcony. To the immediate right of the entrance door, next to the bar, was a tiny room with a single wrap around booth and a table taking up all the room. This room was reserved only for members of the Vallon family; either to lounge peacefully away from the riffraff in the main room, or to conduct business in private.Next to the stairs leading upstairs is a door leading to a small room with stone steps spiraling down into the tavern\u2019s large basement and cellar. Almorlin\u2019s office as a small cot for her to sleep in.Bedrooms/John\u2019s Office:The upper floor was more compact and tight than the lower floor, with a long narrow hallway running the length of the building; from the stairs to the opposite end. The hallway was dark, with only a couple of wall sconces lit, and warm. One could feel the immediate change in temperature once fully upstairs. To either side were plain wood doors leading to modest bedrooms reserved for the Vallon Family only. Inside each was a small single bed, a couple chests and shelves, a dresser, and a basic and old desk pushed against the wall, generally under a window if the room has one.The exception was John Vallon\u2019s bedroom, which had an extra room which served as a small storage area. On the opposite side of his room, on the far end of the hallway, was John\u2019s office. It, much like all the rooms on the upper floor, was a utilitarian affair, having just what was useful and having very little in the way of decoration. John\u2019s desk was to the right of the larger room and was made of a dark oak. Across from his desk chair were two plain pine wood chairs, not unlike the ones down in the bar, for guests and business associates. The desk was old and stained, the wood grain barely discernible, and the surface as covered in books, ledgers, and parchments with a couple inkwells and quills nearby. Behind the desk sat a couple chests and shelves containing important documents and the like for the Gang.Across from the hallway door was the double doors leading out onto the balcony.Balcony:The Garrison\u2019s balcony was fairly large and went the length of the whole front side of the tavern with half of it covered by a large wooden awning. Several circular tables were spaced around the balcony with a small mini bar on the edge holding various liquors flanked by a small keg upon a stand containing the Vallon\u2019s specialty beer. When the small private room in the main bar wasn\u2019t big enough or when it was particularly beautiful outdoors, the balcony is where the Vallons would congregate and socialize and, on occasions, conduct family business.Other than the two thugs standing guard with their razor bycockets, clubs, and small crossbows, there was a pretty brunette that attended the small bar and keg, serving the family when needed.Basement/Cellar:The basement is a large square room with four stone pillars in the center of the room. In the center of the four pillars is a small square matt and three rough-hewn braided ropes are wrapped around the four pillars to make a small ring area for the Vallon Gang\u2019s underground fight club. Several wooden chairs are spaced around all four sides of the ring for spectators, the rest of whom would stand on busy nights, and a Vallon family bookmaker stands close by the stairs to take bets as people entered the small arena. Although there are many wall sconces and hanging lanterns, it is still a dimly lit room lacking any natural light, and a mildly-strong musty smell clings to the air.To the immediate left of the stairs is a short and narrow hallway that leads to the cellar. The entranceway is guarded by two Vallon thugs who only allow entry to family members and certain authorized employees.House Rules1. Vallon Family word is law; do as they say when they say it, or leave.2. The servers are for looking at, not touching. First offenders will have their hands crushed.3. Drunken fights are forbidden, take it down to the basement if you need to fight.4. Destruction and vandalism are forbidden, and appropriate punishments will be dished out for offenders.5. Tabs are only kept for trusted parties. New patrons will pay up front for their service. Those who do not will be forced to fight in the basement until debts are paid off.Fight Club Rules1. These are good, clean, fun; do not purposefully kill or maim your opponent.2. When you step in the ring, you take an assumption of risk and therefore the Vallon Family isn\u2019t responsible for any injuries that occur in the ring.3. Speak to the bookie if you wish to participate in the fighting.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/Pt8yXNi.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/xrBs4tP.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><hr><b style=\"font-size:-webkit-xxx-large;\"><u><font face=\"arial\">The Garrison</font></u></b></hr></div>"}, "post-82029": {"user": "Shoe-Sack Jack", "user_num": 2996, "timestamp": "1524416818000", "message": "A barrel-of-a-man slugged his way through the pouring rain until he came upon The Garrison.

He noticed the uncommonly large man walk through the door, but, at first, due to the distance, dim lighting, and the fairly large crowd, the bartender couldn\u2019t make out many details about the newcomer at first.It wasn\u2019t until the man settled his considerable bulk on a bar stool that Frank got a good look; noting the blood stains and the bruises on the newcomer\u2019s face, and the ripped shirt. Frank didn\u2019t take pity, however, and frowned when asked for something free. He shot the newcomer a sidelong glance with his lopsided face as he refilled another patron\u2019s tankard and raked the coins off the counter and into a pouch sewn on his dirty white apron.\u201cFree, huh?\u201d Frank asked. His voice was a low baritone and slightly raspy. He pushed off the counter and fetched a tankard from below the bar and walked to a keg that didn\u2019t see much use, and filled the wooden cup halfway with the water. The water was there for those who couldn\u2019t hold their liquor and needed something to chase the alcohol down. It was gotten for free nearly every morning when one of the serving girls fetched it from the local well. However, the Vallons still charged by the shot.Back in front of the bloodied man, Frank set the tankard onto the bar, but, before the man could reach for it, Frank leaned over and let loose a large wad of phlegm into the water. Flashing the newcomer a wicked smile of yellowed and crooked teeth, Frank slowly pushed the tankard towards him. \u201cAin\u2019t nothin\u2019 in this life for free,\u201d Frank rasped. He then nodded towards Almorlin\u2019s office, the door flanked by two Vallon thugs, one nearly as large as the newcomer, and with a Red Right Hand tattoo\u00a0just visible on his neck. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, you can take it up with Miss Almorlin\u2026or with John himself.\u201d Instead of moving on to another customer, Frank stayed where he was, staring the newcomer down.

Remembering what the little guy ordered, he grabbed yet another tankard from below the counter and walked over to the keg containing the cider. However, it was just apple cider. The fuck that gnome thinks we are, The Midnight Sun? Of course, Frank kept that to himself as he filled the mug up and returned in front of the gnome.Setting the tankard down on the wood counter, Frank pushed it to the gnome. \u201cYou look like you\u2019ve had a hard time recently.

The reason for his sudden greed was the fact he had heard stories of a ruckus down in Central Plaza and rumors of a thousand gold bounty for the capture of a couple gnomes.

The sun was setting in the west and the dancing lights within the tavern spilled out on to the sidewalk as it grew darker outside. Upon entering the tavern, the general hubbub quieted down as the patrons noticed who had walked in, and all took a turn to stare at him. He neither smiled or acknowledged them as he pushed to the bar. Eventually, things returned to normal as he walked behind the bar and grabbed a bottle of beer, nodding to the bartender and servers when they greeted him. He held the bottle against the bar counter and popped the cap off before taking a sip. \u201cAhhhh,\u201d he sighed quietly. He opened his eyes wide for a moment and rolled his shoulders. He could feel the cool drink dropping all the way down to the pit of his stomach. Refreshing. The tiredness faded from his body ever so slightly...if only for a moment. But, it was better than nothing.\u201cLadies and gentlemen,\u201d John calmly called out. He was always calm. Apathetic, even. Steady. Again, the general noise of the main room lowered as heads turned his way. He may not be loud, in fact, John was quite soft-spoken, but his voice carried a heavy authority that demanded attention, lest they invoke his wrath. And no one wanted to make John angry.\u201cFor little over a year, we have been here, now, putting down our roots and settling in this city. We turned this\u2026\u201d John raised his hands to gesture around him at the tavern and looked up, soaking up the interior with fondness. \u201c...Hole in the wall, this Beggars House with rat droppings and sour piss, into the Garrison; the best tavern this side of Isra! With our blood, sweat, and tears. In less than a year we turned this fine establishment into a prospering business. Now,\u201d John continued, raising his right hand to quieten the crowd. They had gotten quite energetic with his speech. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have done it without any of you. Drinks for everyone! On the house!\u201d All the patrons cheered and clambered to their feet. \u201cA toast! To one more year of prosperity and drunken shenanigans!\u201d John then raised his own bottle of beer above his head before bringing it back down and draining it. He slammed it on the counter when he was finished. Without wasting any more time, John walked out from behind the bar and worked his way to the stairs leading down to the cellar. He beamed at everyone that tried to get his attention but otherwise said little. He said what he had to say.From somewhere in the newfound excitement, someone had pulled out a fiddle and began playing a fast and fun little tune that involved lots of stamping feet. Soon people were dancing and twirling in what little free space they had, taking to the table tops and kicking glasses off onto the floor. John pulled out a small slender pipe from within his coat and gently put it between his lips as he searched his pockets for a match. He mused the tavern would be mighty messy come morning, littered with garbage, broken glass and furniture, and drunken bums to out of it to have gone home. Oh well. John usually didn\u2019t like his tavern getting trashed, but tonight was a special occasion.At the door to the cellar, John puffed on his pipe before pushing past it as the burly guard held it open for him. He heard it locked behind him. All that noise would also make it hard for any potential eavesdropping. Which was important tonight, for instead of a prize fight, a shady meeting was taken place downstairs.Where the ring would normally be, instead was a large oval table made of sturdy oak. Lying atop it was numerous maps and parchments and scrolls and lit candles. There was some chatter down here, mostly whisperings, and it all stopped when the few in the cellar heard John\u2019s approaching footsteps. A couple folks said his name in greeting, mostly his family. They were all here, including a distant cousin that traveled with the Grayson caravan. They hated the city and preferred to camp outside, so they had only sent him as their representative.\u201cQuite the party ye got up \u2018tere, John,\u201d Said the Grayson cousin.\u201cAye,\u201d replied John as he took his place by the dimly lit table. It was cold and damp down here, like most wine cellars, and their voices carried and echoed in the small chamber. However, the festivities, especially the stomping, could be clearly heard, albeit, muffled by the thick wood flooring above their heads. \u201cI reckon Frank\u2019s already about ready to burst a vein.\u201d That garnered a few light chuckles.Not everyone was here, he noticed.
