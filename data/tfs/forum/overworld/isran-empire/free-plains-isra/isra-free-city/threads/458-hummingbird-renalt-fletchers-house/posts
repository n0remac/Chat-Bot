Roxanne will be awfully cross if she knows you're here, you know. She still thinks you cast a spell on me, tried to tell me that it wasn't real...it was real though, wasn't it?\"He cast a nervous glance over his shoulder, worried that Roxanne come see what the commotion was, but the house was silent.
