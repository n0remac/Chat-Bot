While walking, some woman rudely brused by and caused her parasol to jerk away in a direction that exposed her elbow for a split second to the sun, making a small sizzle. \"Ah!\"Skarlet looked down at her elbow, it was just a minor burn, she needed to be more careful about people being near her in daylight. The vampire glared at the woman who walked away. She smelt strange.The girl continued on her way, until a bum began to harass her. She looked down with disgust upon them, but something seemed familiar. This person smelled the same as the other woman. Skarlet stormed away and heightened her senses back to how they were in her first days when she was a ravenous beast. She was being followed, she could sense the same presence moving around nearby, stalking her. 'What fool would stalk one that used to stalk?' She thought to herself.Skarlet turned a corner into a tunnel under an overpass. In the darkness she closed her parasol and waited for her stalker to come. Her eyes were closed until she sensed they had entered the tunnel. Once opened her eyes glowed a bright red in the darkness.She looked upon the one following her with a hypnotic gaze that would petrify the weak-willed with her eyes wide open. She readied herself to attack and hissed, \"You're following me. Why? Do you not know what I am?\"The air in the tunnel had become eerily chilled by Skarlet's doing.

He grumbles in annoyance with each step on the hard cobblestone it is too far below his pain threshold to actually hurt him but it is still annoying and uncomfortable. He wished he had money or better yet just a spare set of boots, unfortunately he had neither which meant he had to retrieve his gear from where he left it.

His objective located he heaves himself to his feet and ambles over. Grabbing the ladle and proceeds to drink greedily dipping the ladle into the water over and over until finally his thirst is satiated.As he returns the ladle to its place something that was stuck in the back of Alden's mind rises closer to the surface tantalizing close but just out of reach. Peering into the water barrel he stares at his reflection. His normally clean shaven face is covered in the beginnings of a scraggly beard, his hair is tangled matted with dirt and bits of straw stick out. Though his eyes still shine with mirth his face is creased and strained by fatigue.\"I look like a vagrant.\"Alden mutters in surprise he hadn't realized just how hard the past few days had been on him. The thought he was trying to catch though it had nothing to do with his appearance or at least not his face. Alden slips a finger into the water barrel wetting it before rubbing some of the dirt off of his leather arm guard. Underneath the dirt and grime is plain brown slightly scuffed leather. There were no runes carved into the surface, no traces of magic, and it was the wrong weight to have a plate of metal sewn between the layers. Next Alden turns his head looking down at his waist at one of his short swords. He draws two inches of steel from its scabbard it was a well made blade but it was just normal steel. The sword was not made of reinforced silver, etched with runes, and brimming with magical energies. Alden's expression grows remote distant as he looks at the unadorned metal a thought escapes his lips.\"This isn't my gear.\"How had he not noticed this earlier? Though now that he thinks back he had noticed earlier at least on some level. When he had been assessing the various threats he had faced during the last few days he had only considered his natural abilities his gear hadn't factored in. A low pressure begins to build behind Alden's left eye and he sheaths his sword so he can cover his eye with his open palm. What was going on? This thought reverberates in his head. Hi gear was gone this was a problem he should be concerned yet he hadn't even noticed. The pressure in his head builds and builds. How could he have been aware of something so vital only subconsciously when it was obvious at cursory glance. The pain in his head is becoming blinding his thoughts begin to scatter. Who was...? Where had he...? A high pitched piercing noise resonates in his ear he gasps out as the pain becomes neigh on crippling.\"It doesn't matter, don't worry.\"The thought enters his head from nowhere but he embraces it, he clings to it, and slowly the building pressure fade. Of course he has nothing be worried about everything was good he was free that's all that mattered. Shaking off the last vestiges of whatever had just happened Alden's grin returns as bright as ever. Some how in the throws of his little fit an idea had come into his head which he announces out loud to the street.\"If I look like a beggar may as well act as one.\"With that exclamation he turns toward the grand market he had spotted during his brief time atop the Spire and he begins to move.<Exit to the Grand Bazaar. >", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Having successfully retrieved his boots Alden finds a bench and sits down.

She hadn't been in such a great city ever before. The amount of people she saw was unfamiliar. She was used to be alone or more like be alone with Akanor. She had always been talking to him, although she knew he couldn't understand her. For outsiders it would probably look weird, but it made her feel less alone. Thinking of that, she should probably not do that in here, when others were close by watching. It would certainly make her look weird to others.She patted the side of the wolf at her side and exchanged a look with him. Although they couldn't understand each other, there was still a bond that intertwined them, so even without a form of communication they knew what the other felt.Simultaneously they started walking through alleys with houses on the opposing sides and people walking around them or standing together, talking. She somehow felt uncomfortable with so many others around and looked for a place to get some space between them and her. But she really needed to find an inn. It was getting dark and she was tired.As Leona was roaming through the streets, getting the feeling that she was starting to get lost, she eventually found herself on a street, that looked a lot different than all the other streets she had wandered on. As she slowly walked on she saw all different kinds of things. There were stalls with traders advertising their wares to potential customers, drunk patrons exiting bars, singing loudly and she could smell all kinds of different smells. She was surprised in what kind of part of town she found herself in. But she didn't have time as people were bumping into her and she got caught in the stream of people walking through the street.To escape this horde, she entered one of the buildings that was closest to her, almost crashing into the door. She rushed in and closed the door behind her, exhaling. This was really stressing her out. She hadn't expected city life to be so frantic. As she turned around, her eyes opened wide and she had to wonder again in what kind of establishment she had stumbled into.[Exiting to Midnight Sun]", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "[Entering from the Southern Gate]"}, "post-32427": {"user": "Lord Tristian Seryl", "user_num": 1222, "timestamp": "1460249031000", "message": "With all of his people inside the walls, Tristian herded the collective mass of Medanese people to the largest square he could find that would accommodate what remained of his people.

If you are unable to find someone willing to take you, the military barracks have been temporarily made available until such time as we are able to provide more housing. We have several events in the works to provide not only housing, but jobs as well. The military is of course always recruiting, and I highly encourage anybody with magical aptitude to speak with the Enclave about signing up.

Halfway through the alley, Skarlet turns to see a dead man laying against a trash bin. She crouches down and inspects the body to find how he was killed.\"It seems this man was stabbed repeatedly in the stomach, from his appearance he must be a vagrant. I doubt his death is of much significance, another vagrant may have just had a feud with him.\" Skarlet searched the pockets of the man to find a folded picture, a man and a woman, she looked up to compare them and this was definitely the man in the picture. \"He looks happy in this picture. A shame for him to meet such a tragic twist of fate.\"She puts the picture back and taps on the jewel on her necklace to inform through telepathy about the body. \"I've found a dead man in an alley off 24th street near the Nexus. He has been killed by a stabbing. Please send someone to remove it.\"Skarlet looks down at the man again and reaches her hand toward his wound.

He showed the single coin to C'vektur, it resting in his outstretched palm. He closed his hand around the coin, making a fist which he quickly slapped with the open palm of his other hand. The gnome opened the hand containing the coin to show that two bronze colored coins had joined the silver one in his hand.Badger tossed one of the coins from his right hand into his left, and quickly and smoothly began to juggle the three small disks. With his patterned established, he would catch a coin, set it on his thumb, and flip the coin with a metallic ringing noise to the other hand. He did this with all three of the coins, keeping them airborne by catching, setting, and re-flipping the coins, which created a smooth even rhythm of pleasant ringing noises.

His movements were extremely comfortable and didn't leave anyone watching with the feeling that he was being rushed.After nearly a minute of his juggling demonstration, Badger flipped all three coins in the air, and with one easy smooth motion whipped off his cap and used it to snatch the coins out of the air. He slapped his cap down on the trunk hard beside him. He leaned down to look very closely at his cap, as if trying to examine a bug he'd caught under it without letting the bug scurry away. After a long moment, Badger lifted his hat and showed C'vektur that the two bronze coins and one silver coin had turned into three brilliantly gleaming gold coins under his hat.He put his cap back on, leaving the gold coins for C'vektur to examine if she'd like.\"That's what a street performer does.\" he said, watching for C'vektur's reaction.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "It was Badger's very nature to talk.

He had spent too long hung up on his own past, never having learnt to grieve naturally, and move on, and had poured out all that... anger and loneliness\u00a0into his \"life's mission\" which, while successful, could hardly ever be considered a success.

Only our present should define us, and while we should take the past we have and learn from it, we should not enslave ourselves to it, because then we do not learn.\"\"I am being\u00a0understanding because I do\u00a0understand. You cannot be \"unworthy\" of me - there is no such thing, for any I know, but especially not for you, Genevieve. If yours is such a wicked heart, which I can ot conceivably see, and mine is so pure, then we must make a perfect pair - like day and night, or summer and winter.\"\"Someone so kind, so beautiful, so talented and intelligent - there could be no one more worthy, and I would be honoured to stand by my side.

One armed stretched out towards her in the vague and ambitious hope that she'd take it, he felt quite the fool. He was getting in over his head. She was too much to deal with. Her emotions were explosive and dangerous. She had gone through such vast personal tragedy - and it was at this that Ryden put down his foot, for as bad as she had suffered, it could not have been worse than he. Surely, she must be able to repurpose that guilt and sorrow, and find a way to deal to it other than unexpected and intense outbursts - but really, that remained to be seen.\u00a0Yet despite warnings going off, Ryden still found her so deeply vulnderable and connectable in her humanity that he couldn't help but gave an affinity for her, an affinity that led to overt lines such as his last. He still found something about her so expectionally attractive and magnetic that he was simply... drawn to her.

They eyed him as he were a stray dog found on their back porch... Perhaps foaming at the mouth at the way one ushered the other to the nearest doorway. Sadness filled the wander. Had loosing an eye really cost him that much? He remembered when his smile caught him more than a wave, most of the time a wink and a snuggle. Tavern girls with well shaped ankles,and tricky smiles. Lamenting over what was never truly yours was foolish, yet he could not help it... His adventure in the milk bar had cost him dearly... Not only his spy glass but his right eye as well.

The initial haste was quickly lessened as he found that no one apparently made saddles of a quality that equaled the elven ones. \"Tsch... Just give me the very best one you have then. I think... it's this big!\" Vithkun said and held up hands to visualize what it had to accompany. \"Probably... normal size.\" Vithkun concluded at least before coins changed hands and he quickly rode back to the gate. Assuming she was still waiting for him he would ride over next to her and hand her the saddle. It was made by the finest leather and had ample cushion for long rides. \"Here, mount this instead of that... napkin.\" he said and twitched ever so slightly with the sight of what she had expected to make the journey with. \"I will pack my saddle while you fix this.\" he said as Windstrider went down on its knees enabling him to step through it without Vithkun having to do unsightly acrobatics like swinging his leg over its back.

Hours had passed since dawn now and he was wasting more time rushing off to grab supplies that she either had not or something he had left behind. Watching him ride up holding the saddle, when he needed none, it softened slightly until he handed it to her. Holding it with both hands it was as light as a feather despite being full leather in make but with drow strength it was difficult to judge what humans might find heavy.

There were no caravans of carriages or impenetrable walls of people to interrupt her leisurely stroll. While those from the countryside would likely disagree, Grandma almost found this to be a peaceful experience. A little urchin girl dressed in brown and crimson leathers slinks through the alleyways of Isra, searching for an easy mark. Normally, she'd be looking to break into a closed shop or vacant house in order to clear it of valuables, but she's distracted this night by a dream she had the previous. In it she saw an old woman, garbed head to toe in shimmering golden robes, arms spread, a bright light shining down from the center of her chest onto the prone thief, basking her in a light she instinctually knew to be her salvation.She had awoken disappointed; the dream had felt so real, real enough that her body and subconscious mind had been tricked into a false sense of rightness. Yet there she was, lying on her lumpy hay cot in the musty defunct cellar of an old abandoned tavern, in the dark, with a growling stomach and no more hope for the future than the day prior. Everything was still wrong with the world.Lost in her own thoughts, she almost stumbles directly into the line of sight of the hooded figure that stalks the night with her pair of well-dressed guardians. But, as the urchin girl slips back into the alleyway she'd been about to step out from, she catches a glimpse of the woman's face and her eyes widen to the size of saucers.That's her! The old lady from her dreams! And...look at all that loot dangling from her fingertips, just waiting to be repurposed! It is surely unwise for an old lady to be waddling around the streets at night, especially when people like Str\u00e5lende, self-proclaimed best thief in Isra, were on the prowl. After all, Str\u00e5lende has never been caught, not once, despite her regular pilfering excursions. And this old lady looked half blind. Her tall dark and handsome guards may pose an issue, but...The urchin snaps her fingers as she thinks up a dastardly plot, and runs back down the alleyway, boots thumping softly against the cobblestone. She turns a few corners to a roaming pack of feral dogs rummaging through a broken garbage receptacle -- those same dogs that had ruined her score the last night by alerting just about the entire town to her presence and chasing her halfway through the city before she slipped their pursuit. She figures it's time for them to repay her.\"Hey, you stupid ugly mutts!\" she shouts, and the lead one, a massive black bulldog with a barrel chest and angry eyes, lifts his head and perks his ears in her direction. She picks a pebble off the ground and throws it at the dog, miraculously hitting it right in the eye, causing it to yelp, and then to growl in feral rage.\"That's right, dumb dog! Come chase me! Why not have some fresh meat tonight instead of all that trash!\" she goads, tossing another pebble. This one soars over the dog's head, but the first shot did its job, and the second alerted the other four dogs to her presence. The entire pack glares at her now, teeth bared, ears pressed back against their heads, tails straight up. They're a terrifying sight, and clearly ready to kill, but Str\u00e5lende grins from ear to ear and shouts again for them to come after her. She then takes off down the alleyway from whence she came, the dogs taking this as a cue to give chase. Just as she'd planned. She tears off down the streets toward the last place she saw the cloaked old woman, the dogs snarling and baying behind her, until she comes to the alleyway from which she first spotted Grandma. She's behind the old lady now, but that works out in her favour, as she rounds the corner, her boots skidding on the slightly damp pavement, and runs at full tilt toward Grandma and Co. The dogs aren't far behind now, nearabout nipping at Str\u00e5lende's heels, and their vicious barks undoubtedly alert the inquisitors. Too late, however, as Str\u00e5lende tears through the center of them and slams face first into Grandma with enough force to topple the old lady, while the pack of feral dogs falls upon the inquisitors with blind fury.Str\u00e5lende feigns a startled yelp and reaches out to catch Grandma from falling, grabbing her hand in the process and stabilizing her. She does a discreet patdown of Grandma's cloaks as she further helps the old woman to stay upright, cutting and slipping any coin purse she feels out of its folds and then running off down the street again. If Grandma inspects the hand the girl grasped, she'll find her rings missing, although more intriguing to one trained in magical arts is the clearly unnatural compulsion not to notice anything out of the ordinary.\"Sorry!\" the urchin girl calls back. A genius move, Str\u00e5lende thinks. The dogs should keep those big beefy red-robed guys occupied. Maybe the dogs might even come out on top and get that free meal they'd been looking for. Either way, it'll give Str\u00e5lende plenty of time to get clear so that she can count her loot... or so she believes. That dream of hers must mean that the old woman was the score that would bag her enough coin to get her own place and live comfortably, right? She can think of no other interpretation.
