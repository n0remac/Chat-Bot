As one enters the glass doors, one would step upon a polished, reflecting floor of marble. Up the quartz steps is a desk, crafted by the finest red wood found. On either side of the steps are two beautiful pieces of greenery, and a small pool of water, with fish circling in the waters. In the winter months, the pools of water are obscured by enchanted bronze platings, to keep the fish warm. The lighting is provided by lightstones within the ceiling, obscure the gorgeous piano in the far corner of the room. Warm, comfortable and plush chairs form circles around hand-crafted tables, bookshelves with elegantly etched markings upon the rim, full of books on various subjects.The lobby, with a ballroom further down the hall. Five floors, dedicated purely to customer lodging. At the seventh floor is the kitchen and faculty lounge, on the eighth, storage. On the ninth, faculty lodging, and on the tenth, a massage parlor, with a sauna. On the eleventh, and final, floor is an exclusive club, with entry permitted only by the benevolent matron of Temptation, Selene herself. Below the grand hotel lays a beautiful, all natural pool, carved from the stone beneath, fed by a tributary of the Silverion River, purified to the most extreme extent possible by crystalline geodes. Areas of the pool are heated by under-ground geysers, while others teeter upon the edge of becoming ice.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.pinimg.com/originals/fb/18/0d/fb180dfacce28e61e3e3c0205bc1e3cd.jpg"], "html": "A beautiful architectural wonder, the "}, "post-85834": {"user": "Selene", "user_num": 3123, "timestamp": "1539839101000", "message": "Selene's carriage drew up into the front of the hotel, and the woman smiled at the sight of her inn. Gently waking the sleeping Myra, Selene looked at Frans Zintler, beckoning him and Evelyn to follow her out of the carriage.\"Yeahs, I'm a comin'!\" Frans said. A valet came and pulled the carriage away shortly after. As Frans stepped into the lobby, he was nearly overwhelmed by the bright lights and opulence. He knew that Selene LeBeau was well off, but he had clearly underestimated by how much!Waiting for them by one of the railings, was a pale woman with spiky black hair, dressed in a black pantsuit. In her hands, pressed against her bosom, was a clipboard. Her glasses slid down the bridge of her nose, before she put them up, the rim gleaming. \"Madame Myra, Madame Evelyn, Ms. Selene, welcome back. Greetings, Frans Zintler. I have a few papers I need you to sign before Madame Pyrope and Madame Sapphire can go to Tawakoshi. Lady Wu requested that Madame Crystal be reassigned back to this hotel, as there.. Is apparently friction between Madame Crystal and Lady Star.\"\"Ever so diligent, dearest Jane.\" Selene praised with a chuckle. \"Tell Lady Wu that her request is approved, but tell her to keep Lady Star under control. I grow tired of Maria Star's refusal of transfers.\" At Frans' confused look, Selene elaborated.\"Lady Wu and Maria Star are the two runners and matrons of a hotel I have in another city. Lady Star hates me, and tends to try to drive any transfers I send to leave my company. Crystal however, fought back. Remind me to give Crystal a raise,\" she said to Secretary Jane, who nodded, jotting it down. \"Pyrope and Sapphire want to go to Tawakoshi for a small vacation. You may work with them a little bit, Pyrope more than Sapphire.\"\"There was also a paper I found, that I want you to look at, Ms. Selene. You'll find it on your desk, it concerns the Empress.\"\"Thank you, Jane. Now, Frans, this is Jane Alistair, my Prime Secretary. Be respectful, treat her with courtesy. She will teach you your duties, so pay attention.\" Selene offered her hand to the youth, who took it firmly. Ribbons of glimmering magic enveloped their hands, trailing up their arms. Frans was too stunned to respond to the magic, as it invaded his very being. The surge of power faded, as Myra giggled at Frans' face. \"What was.. That?\" He spluttered out.\"Just an initiation rite, kid.\" Evelyn mocked snidely.\"Welcome to Temptation, Zintler.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Selene's carriage drew up into the front of the hotel, and the woman smiled at the sight of her inn.

It wasn't long before he was heading towards the Temptation again.He'd pause after entering to adjust his crimson coat and quickly sweep a hand through his near black hair, making sure it was still all as it should be and no mischievous breeze had disturbed it, before taking in the interior of the grand hotel. What he saw caused a slight smile to creep to the edges of his lips as he made his way towards the desk, tip-tapping his cane on the floor as he did so. The raven on his shoulder wouldn't find the surroundings nearly as interesting, but did seem to find an eerie fascination with the receptionist and other beings in the lobby.He stopped in front of the desk with a final tap, having brought his cane down one last time to announce his arrival. \"Good day,\" He started with an almost friendly tone. \"Do you happen to have any availability? I'm expecting to be here at least a fortnight, if not longer.\" He'd carefully watch the receptionist with shaded eyes, and at any signs of concern he'd be quick to dispel such thoughts with a polite smile and a curt response. \"Don't worry, I can pay for it all just fine.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The Temptation had certainly interested Nexus from the moment he had laid eyes on the building.
