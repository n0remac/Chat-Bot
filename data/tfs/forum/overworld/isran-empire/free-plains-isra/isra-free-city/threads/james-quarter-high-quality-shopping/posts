No, they weren't bedecked in jewels or yards of lace or even silk, but their plain yet tasteful attire would have been the envy of even the poorest peasant. Their grooming was immaculate, and they kept their distance... even though watchful eyes were subtly waiting for the black cloaked girl to show an interest in something.Indeed, the faint smell of fresh-baked bread was in the air, along with something exotic, something spicy that tugged in another direction.

A thin crack spread down the front of the mask, and a dark liquid dripped and bubbled down its white surface. Behind him, the stomping of boots and shouting of men announced the approach of at least six pursuers, perhaps more.As the Foxgloves ran, he raised his left arm, pulling off the purple glove to reveal absolutely nothing beneath. Reaching into his pocket, he pulled out a severed left hand, which twitched and grasped at the air in his grip. He cast a furtive glance behind him before stuffing the hand onto the empty sleeve of his left arm. He cradled the arm and hand against his chest as he rummaged in his pocket once more, producing a silver needle and bright purple thread. Ducking behind a rubbish barrel, he began to hurriedly sew the hand directly to the cuff of his sleeve, in a series of neat purple stitches around the wrist. As soon as he'd tied off the last stitch, he cut the thread and flexed the fingers of his new hand. A glassy\u00a0purple orb appeared in the palm of the hand, swirling and growing until it was the size of an orange. He stood up, just in time to see the mirrored masks of his black-cloaked pursuers round the corner. He flung the orb into the street ahead of them, where it burst into a cloud of heavy smoke. As they coughed and choked, he took the opportunity to flee down the road and jump into the nearest open window he could find.The window that Foxgloves flung himself into turned out to lead directly into one of the many showrooms of the St. James Quarter. He landed in a heap on the ground, a tangled mess of coats and cloth and twisted limbs. He crawled away from the window to hide behind a display of ladies' petticoats, before pulling himself to his feet and shaking himself off. Glancing down at his new left hand, he noted with some dissatisfaction that the palm was severely burned. It was so hard to get strong, magic-inclined parts nowadays. Checking his reflection in a mirror, he shook his head at his thoroughly disheveled state and wiped away the dark fluid from the painted smile of his cracked mask. That was far too close of a call, he thought...but perhaps the day was looking up. Perhaps he'd be able to find a friend, a prior customer. Stepping away from the mirror, he began to tiptoe his way around the showroom, looking to and fro for the vast store's proprietor.\"Ms. St. James,\" he called, his voice raspy and weak. \"Ms. St. James, are you there?

The blonde stepped onto the tile, and gestured for Misaika to join her. \"Please come!\" She said, and once Misaika had stepped onto the circle, they faded away in glitter...... only to appear in the Apothecarie building. The windows revealed a different garden, with a wading pool, and there were shelves and decorative cabinets and desks all tastefully arranged with different ingredients one might need for all manner of science or enchantment. Behind a large, broad, cherrywood counter was a very distinguished looking, black-furred fox man, who peeled the glasses off the end of his snout and stopped reading his book when he saw the blonde and misaika step off their circle in the hall and enter the open archway into the official Apothecarie branch.\"Ah, mademoiselles! Please, make yourself comfortable,\" he spoke, his voice a deep baritone and punctually perfect. He was dressed most fashionably, with not a stitch out of place. \"How may I be of service?\"The blonde curtsied and blushed just a little. \"Good day, Monsieur Caledion. This miss is looking for small bottles for purchase!\"\"I see,\" said the foxman as he glanced at the blonde's blush and then at Misaika, his golden eyes austere. \"For what purpose might one wish to procure small bottles?\" he asked her._________________________________________________________________Foxgloves The peddler had found himself within the work room\u00a0of the Clothing & Apparel department, specifically for the ladies. He was ragged and torn up, and whispering none-too-subtly\u00a0for Ms. St James, which quickly caught the attention of one of the maids that was working in the room.\u00a0Alarmed, she came off her cushioned stool and there was a small clatter of things in the room and the dropping of material -- apparently, needles and thread had been working without\u00a0workers until the dark-haired maiden had been shocked. She looked horrified, quiet honestly, until Foxgloves\u00a0stumbled into some hanging something-or-other in the light and airy workplace, and instead of looking horrified for her life,\u00a0she looked horrified for her clothes.\"Oh non, monsieur!\" She said, her Gauldish accent quite\u00a0thick as she rushed to get the hanging items away from Foxgloves. \"Is precious!\" She exclaimed in Common, for clearly she was not well-versed in the language.

The best hour to go thieving, all good thieves know that. Most would be asleep by now, even the hoodlums and party goers, and the night shift guards would be getting bored and complacent. The perfect conditions for a career master thief like Fiona. Under the cover of darkness, the intrepid anti-hero skulks across the rooftops of Isra, skirting chimneys and balancing across the peaked roofs, stopping only to pet the odd cat along the way. Not a sound can be heard as she moves, and only her slight silhouette can be seen as she crossed the moonlight before vanishing. Most villains decide to wear capes, or big baggy clothing to make themselves more intimidating, but not Fiona, if you could even call her a villain. Her clothing clings tightly to her form, stopping it from catching on anything, and reducing her size, allowing her to get by unnoticed. Finally, she arrives at her target, the St. James quarter, the epitome of capitalism and one of the biggest money-sinks in Isra. You would have to be stupid to think that Lady St James doesn't know that, though, and has made every precaution. But even then education doesn't run rampant through the streets of Isra. Many who have tried have been caught and now reside on many lists and often in cells. But for a smart thief, they may actually have a chance. Enter: Fiona Blythe. Unfortunately, getting to the top of the building is a strenuous task, with it being its own block, free standing and defiant to any thieves, but Fiona didn't need to get to the top, she just had to get to the third level. Finding a gap in the guards' routine is child's play, and before she knows it, she's scaling up the side of the building and up towards a third floor balcony. Being a smart cookie, the woman decides to scale the eastern part of the building, as the moon had already begun it's descent to the west, casting it's light on that side of the building. \"Easy,\" she whispers to herself as she gets to the balcony. No alarms tripped, no curious guards\u2026 easy part complete. Before she can start the hard part though, she pulls her pack off her back and pulls out a second pair of boots, these ones being softly padded and clean. Once her dirtier boots are stored away, she gets to work, her eyes peering out from under her hood, and her ears pricked up and listening. How does she get in\u2026 The balcony doors are sure to be alarmed, not to mention locked. Locks are easy to pick, but Fiona had seen systems designed with magical properties, and she isn't about to put it past St. James to have the obvious entry points done. The larger windows? Probably the same. Our hero had scaled the building without much issue, using ledges and drain pipes, so just about any skilled thief could do the same. But the smaller windows? A lithe form like Fiona could squeeze in without too much issue, and who would lock a storeroom window? Or a washroom window? Seems the best option. So, Fiona slips over the railing and begins to shimmy across the ledge and windowsills towards a window she spied towards the corner of the building. Small, unpatterned, and unimportant. Bingo. She makes gentle work of moving along the ledge, arms out against the wall, feeling the grooves and textures as her long legs shuffle along. She stops at the last show-room window before her destination however, to take one last peek in, looking for signs of guards, alarms, trip wires, anything that could hamper her progress before it even begins\u2026 ", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Under the Cover of Darkness.

The cabinets of the REALLY fancy stuff weren't her target here, instead it's the storage bins that held the slightly less fancy bottles, the ones that didn't necessarily need to be overlooked. Why?

She had heard from a reputable source that a new line of jewels had been unveiled for sale, some of the most precious gems in all the lands, now on display with high price points, but these aren't the target. Fiona is smart enough to know that those jewels would be in the most secure of positions, with every piece of security at St. James' disposal trained on them. Last year's selection though? Those would have just been moved, and Fiona has a hunch she knows where. Either to the displays a few rooms over, or the backroom for re-cataloguing, which one though depended on the staff's efficiency and speed, which Fiona hopes she has as much faith in as St James surely does. They aren't nearly as valuable as this year's, and considering the price, they weren't as valuable when they were new either. But, Fiona's odds of swiping them were far superior than this year's, which still meant a decent paycheck without as much risk.

However she didn't really care about the bottles anymore, she wanted the fox instead and couldn't take her eyes of him. \"Maybe you can... show me your assortment of suitable bottles?\" she asked with a faint smile, hoping for it to get up, so she could get a little closer to it.

He finished his bottle and let out a deep sigh.\u00a0He turned to walk the opposite way of the eerie looking man and when he got in reach broke into a sprint. Emery was fast. Shockingly so. In a fragment of a second he gripped the mans coin pouch and fled passed him. \"Nice, it's heavy.\"\u00a0He thought to himself.\u00a0A drunk Emery would not seem he had drank that much as he swung from a shops sign to the lip of the roof.
