As she continues, a small sort of mischievous smirk slides its way onto Naoki\u2019s face. Two can play at the coy game. \u201cI maaaay have mentioned something\u2026\u201dShe trails off, clearly teasing. For a moment, she simply sits there, showing no inclination of confirming, denying, or moving in any way. That expectant look. The way Kate\u2019s trying to play it off, to mask it. Endlessly appealing. But the look on her face upon receiving the item ought to be even better, Naoki figures. So she rises, raising her tail to find balance on the unsteady carriage floor. With a few swift steps, she moves around the table to cross to the other side of the cabin, and approach the kitchenette. Bending at the knees, she moves to undo the simple lock and open the cabinet. \u201cI actually have a small handful of items for you, on this marvelous occasion marking the anniversary of your birth. However, some of them are somewhat situational. So, allow me to give you this now, but expect more over the next couple days. And as opportunities present themselves.\u201dThough her smirk isn\u2019t visible from behind, the tail-waggle certainly is, alluding to just what sorts of situations the other gifts may be suitable for. After waiting a moment longer to allow Kate\u2019s mind to wander, Naoki extracts the item from the cabinet, straightens, and crosses back over, now carrying a small box. Roughly the size of one\u2019s hand, fingers outstretched, the box is a fine piece of workmanship in and of itself. Hewn of some manner of reddish wood, there isn\u2019t anything eye catching about it, per say. It is simply a very well made box, with fine-grained wood, polished faces, and the initials, \u2018K. G.\u2019 embossed into the top and inlaid with gold leaf. Moving back to her original position to Kate\u2019s right, Naoki turns half-sideways, extending both arms to offer the box, and its contents, along with a slight sort of almost anxious smile. The object within is a piece of jewelry. A bracelet; a bangle, even, or an anklet, if one would prefer. Forged of Sunmetal, it shines with the soft glow of sunlight itself, and is warm to the touch in the same manner that rays of the sun are warm as they dance across one\u2019s arm. An intricate pattern of two inlaid golden vines snake their way around the circumference of the band, twining around each other and sprouting flowers of inlaid gemstones where they touch- three blooms, equidistant from each other.The first flower is- while not perhaps any sort of technically accurate, real flower, a circular sort of thing, with many small, radial petals. Presently, it\u2019s a soft dusky orange hue gently tinged with a shade of creamy ivory. The second flower, proceeding clockwise, is a rather pleasant sort of orchid-looking thing, apparently cut of some manner of deep purple amethyst. Lastly, the final flower on the  band is apparently a rendition of a tiger lily, complete with the little speckles interspersed throughout the otherwise-transparent flower as imperfections. After waiting for the box to be opened and its contexts examined, Naoki continues, \u201cThis is, in addition to being a beautiful piece of jewelry, a powerful magical apparatus. The first masterwork of Dawnfire Forges, primarily credited to Forgemaster Epirus, it was only finished this morning.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s made out of Sunmetal. It uses the sun\u2019s rays to maintain a whole host of enhancements, major and minor. Across the whole band, a few utilities are in place to prevent it from getting dirty, damaged, stolen, or any of that. This flower,\u201d she gestures with an extended finger, \u201cthis is quartz. It would usually be white, but color of it changes with the time of day, due to the enchantment. Right now it\u2019s a pleasant sort of yellow for mid-morning, but as the day goes on, keep an eye on it. It should transition into a brighter yellow as noon passes, darken down to orange for the afternoon, fading into purple and then midnight black for the dead of night. And, if you press on it, it emits light. Useful in the dark, I would think.\u201d\u201cThis flower,\u201d Naoki continues, indicating the orchid, \u201cis much like the gemstone in your ribbon, but with a few extras. It\u2019s linked directly to my earring. As long as it\u2019s purple, I am well, and you can press on it to contact me, wherever we might happen to be in the world relative to each other. Likewise, as long as the band is close to you- and you\u2019re well, I will know. Mutual peace of mind, I figure.\u201d\u201cAnd, this flower here,\u201d She points to the tiger lily, \u201c this contains all of the defensive magics. Very, very powerful stuff in here, you should be aware. The majority of it is autonomous. If someone in your vicinity harbors ill-intent toward you, it will cause the entire band to go cold. If you are assaulted, it will defend you with wards and other such\u2026 defensive magics. I\u2019m not quite clear on the details. You can press on it to manually engage what I\u2019m told is a full-body shield, which ought to protect you from all manners of attack. Additionally, if any of this flower\u2019s functions are engaged, my security people will be alerted, and you can expect Sun Marshals to be on the scene as quickly as they possibly can be.\u201dLeaning back, Naoki awaits Kate\u2019s reaction with bated breath, arms extended, palms on knees.

It\u2019s been a long while since she\u2019s been issued a command. Still, she supposes, nothing too terrible could come of it, especially considering that Naoki is aware of the contents of Artemis\u2019 gift box.

Perhaps it\u2019s a polite way to refer to her chest. Fair enough. Presuming that the previous command has been invalidated by the most recent one, Naoki sits up and spends a moment to remove her top- the same one she had arrived to Green\u2019s Greens with earlier that day. She struggles for a moment with the neck, attempting to remove the garment without totally disheveling her hair, but is highly unsuccessful with that secondary goal. In the process of pulling it up over her head, any semblance of a reasonable hairstyle is ruined, leaving locks of hair tumbling every which way, covering her face. Frustrated with the garment, Naoki tosses it away to the opposite side of the cabin, nodding slightly to herself as it crumples against one of the kitchenette cabinets. Then, she turns to face Kate, and brushes the hair from her eyes.Upon properly noticing the item held in Kate\u2019s hand, Naoki\u2019s complexion manages- perhaps by some miracle, to lighten several shades, and her pupils dilate to complete the alarmed look. Of all of the items in that box Kate could have chosen to select. The harness. The clips. Any of the whips, or the other assorted implements. Of them all, Kate had chosen the feather. Instinctively, Naoki makes an uncharacteristic move to cover herself, crossing her arms across her chest and becoming acutely aware of how chilly it seems to be in the carriage without one\u2019s top.Perhaps it was a lucky guess. Perhaps it was a coincidence. Or perhaps Kate and Artemis had shared a few words, either previously or just now in the selection of the item. Regardless of how the situation came to be, Naoki finds herself as a deer in the metaphorical headlights of that seemingly innocuous feather. Time seems to pass in slow motion; Kate\u2019s talk of \u2018letters\u2019 and \u2018rules\u2019 fall on deaf ears. Hearing, but not comprehending.

She attempts to sit up, raising a hand in protest. \u201cNo, wait~!\u201dAnd then it began.

Someone is giggling wildly. Is it her? Perhaps. She\u2019s too busy giggling wildly to put any serious thought into the matter. Her limbs flail madly, attempting to push, pull, or cover herself, but they can\u2019t quite decide which, so they end up simply flailing about without any real force behind them. Occasionally, the giggling is interspersed with half-conjugated words and phrases, such as \u201cNo, plehehehease,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m ticklish,\u201d \u201cNohohoho, please,\u201d \u201cArtemis, help me,\u201d \u201cYou fiend,\u201d \u201cDammit,\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll pay for this,\u201d  \u201cStahahahapit,\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t breheheathe,\u201d and other assorted moans and expletives of both pleasure and frustration.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "A disappointed sort of pout makes itself present on Naoki\u2019s face as Kate withdraws.
