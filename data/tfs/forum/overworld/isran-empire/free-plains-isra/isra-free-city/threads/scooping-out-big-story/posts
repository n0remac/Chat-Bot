The young reporter has never seen much less talk to a dragon in person. He has heard of the stories and rumors, but rumors only go so far. If he can snatch a few minutes of this beings time, then this article will be a snatch. Now where would a dragon be lurking? Time to start thinking like a dragon. Maybe they would be hiding in the forest or up high in the mountains. Do dragons have actual built homes? What would a house in which a dragon lives looks like?\u00a0Based on the rumors, it would probably be wise of this dragon to not live so close to the town. Tate decides to go and try the outskirts first seeing if there are any indications of where the dragon could be. A dragon sure is a rare sight, but Tate himself is also a rare sight. Not everyday do you see a shark who is scanning the lands for the hottest stories and a shark that lives on land is even more astonishing. Luckily, Tate has become accustomed to the land and doesn't eat as much as his ocean counterparts. He actually has developed a taste for salad. Stay on track Tate, it's time to find a dragon. He adjusts his flat cap before setting out. Hopefully this dragon won't think of Tate as an afternoon snack.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/AKobiJh.jpg", "", ""], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/AKobiJh.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}, "post-96543": {"user": "Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui", "user_num": 102, "timestamp": "1590683782000", "message": "Tate doesn't have to work too hard to find information regarding the dragon.Normally the dragon lay dormant in his lair most months, however it is known he does co-exist among the locals. He rarely purchases items, and if he does most are trinkets and gems; regardless how flawed or intricate they are. While his humanoid disguise is usually not \"stealthy\" per se, in large crowds he can blend his blue robes with the common folk. Individually though, he's easier to pick out: a tall elderly gentlemen however his physical ability is unaffected by his age, a perfect posture, and carries a well decorated longsword.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Tate doesn't have to work too hard to find information regarding the dragon."}, "post-96544": {"user": "Tate Trillings", "user_num": 3702, "timestamp": "1590773971000", "message": "After learning about the dragon and it's possible whereabouts in town he goes and tracks the dragon down.
