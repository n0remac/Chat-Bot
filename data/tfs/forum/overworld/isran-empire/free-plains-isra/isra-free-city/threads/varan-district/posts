It rests on the eastern side of the city, just between the city and the Eastern River Crossing. It currently consists of small, wooden shelters the shield-maidens sleep in, but Aia has plans to continually renovate the camp so it can become an official district of the Free City itself. A small set of docks that allows the longships to be better boarded have been built as well.\u00a0Aia seeks to contact other Varan mercenaries and invite them to the Free City, which will cause the camp to gradually expand. The Varan who live here look up to Aia Heijra as there leader, who in turn has declared loyalty and obedience to Lord Ildesias. These Varan will fight and die for the Free City if it ever comes under attack. As per Varan law and customs, all of these Varan own weapons and armor. Likewise, they always have their weapons equipped; it's Varan customs.\u00a0Many Varan will spend their days training, finding employment with the laborers (farmers, woodsmen, hunters, builders, etc), or visiting the Bazaar.UPDATE #1:\u00a0 The Varan Encampment has now grown in size with the arrival of more Varan mercenaries and supplies.\u00a0 It now resembles a traditional Varan village.UPDATE #2:The Varan Village has now been transformed into its own district on the eastern side of the Free City.\u00a0 It houses many Varan commoners, and is protected by 500 Varan Huscarls, all of whom swear their allegiance to Lady Aia Heijra, who in turns swears allegiance to Lord Ildesias.Any who wish to attack the Free City from the east must first fight the Varan here.\u00a0 The Varan are capable warriors who will not back down from a fight, but are also a good, cheerful, hardy folk with a love of food, drink, and song.\u00a0 The Varan hunt the forests, work as lumberjacks, fishermen, miners, tailors, traders, merchants, and more.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://www.dengamleby.dk/typo3temp/pics/5d83a1b119.jpg"], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><img alt=\"https://www.dengamleby.dk/typo3temp/pics/5d83a1b119.jpg\" height=\"366\" src=\"https://www.dengamleby.dk/typo3temp/pics/5d83a1b119.jpg\" width=\"388\"/><br/></div>"}, "post-6636": {"user": "Aia Heijra", "user_num": 511, "timestamp": "1439866931000", "message": "Aia Heijra and Kyra quickly patrolled through the small Varan encampment on the side of the city. \"Rather primitive compared to the city folk, no?\"Aia smirked at Kyra and replied, \"we'll renovate.
