However, as the little hands begin to explore her body, searching for a pocket that doesn\u2019t exist, Lady Naoki begins to giggle- in a very unladylike and obviously uncontrolled manner. Whether this laughter is born of amusement, joy, or pure ticklishness is hard to say. Regardless, Little Naoki would find that Lady Naoki\u2019s sweaterdress has no pockets, the neck of it coming up far enough to preclude even an improvised pocket. However, Lady Naoki is quick to put a stop to her shenanigans, grasping Little Naoki under the armpits and hoisting her up in the air, holding her just high enough so that her feet dangle just above Naoki\u2019s thighs. Holding her there for a moment, Naoki eyes the child with only the lightest touch of sternness layered atop her otherwise quite pleased expression. \u201cNow, you. It\u2019s not in my pocket, and it\u2019s impolite to grope people without first acquiring their consent. You should strive to be more ladylike.\u201dThis, of course, coming from Naoki of all people, who could debatably be labeled as a Professional Groper and who had only moments ago been giggling uncontrollably as if she were the toddler.With that, Naoki sets the child down in her lap again, and places her right hand atop her head to keep her still for a moment. Finding her fingers in a prime position to do so, Naoki The Larger begins to scratch at the back of Little Naoki\u2019s ears in the manner in which she herself finds it most pleasing to be scratched.\u201cThe key,\u201d Naoki begins, reaching out her left hand over toward the nearest twin (either Kae or Caleb, she can\u2019t quite tell), \u201cIs in here,\u201d she finishes, pointing to one of their ears. Without offering any further explanation, she begins to scratch at that ear. Moments later, a second silver key drops, not from the scratched ear, but rather Naoki\u2019s hand, but that would be somewhat difficult to see due to the sleight of hand involved, especially for he who is being scratched. However, in reality, it was literally up Naoki's sleeve. The key lands on the sofa to Naoki\u2019s left, to the right of the twin and directly before Naoki The Smaller. The second key is more or less identical to the first, save for the fact that its patterns are considerably varied, enough so to tell them apart easily enough. It would fit in the second lock, and once inserted, both keys would be able to be turned, and chest lid would open. The chest lid, one would find, has two braces that extend as the chest is being opened and slot into grooves to prevent the lid from closing until they are both disengaged. Additionally, some manner of precaution- perhaps in the construction of the hinges, has been taken to ensure that the lid is incapable of closing too quickly or too forcefully, and thus, ought not to pose a danger to any little fingers. And even beyond that, within the chest, a small disengage lever for the locks is present, to prevent anyone getting trapped inside. However, as for the actual contents of the chest, the first items one would see would be six little boxes. Small,  square, wooden boxes that seem quite similar to the chest in their construction and style, each being detailed with a similar, but not identical geometric print and hewn of the same wood. On the top of each box, a name has been printed in relief to identify the owner. Six children, six names, six boxes. Each box opens without a key, and inside, one would find a small collection of items. Along the left side, in a specially designated compartment of the box, quills. Four quills, of varying types. One white and plush, one bright and vibrantly blue, another red tinged with yellow around the edges, and the last simply brown. Next to that, two square bottles filled with ink sit corked, one filled with black ink and the other with a deep blue. Next to those, a small, bluish sort of leather bound book only large enough to fit in one\u2019s hand. The cover of each book is printed similarly, with \u2018[Child Name]\u2019s Address Book\u2019. Within the book, a number of pre-lined pages sit prepared to accept addresses. Above the address book, another, similarly constructed but larger crimson tome rests. They are titled, \u2018[Child Name]\u2019s Journal\u2019. As one might expect, the interior of each journal is empty. Beneath all of this, resting in the bottom of each box, a sizeable stack of blank parchment sits adjacent to an equal number of envelopes. Lastly, to fill out the small bit of remaining space in the box, a small wrapped chocolate has been included. Once the boxes of writing supplies are removed, the contents of the chest beneath them would become visible. That is to say, the books. The remainder of the chest, laid three layers thick, is filled with books. A rough estimate would see two hundred or so tomes in there, neatly stacked and all matching, apparently from the same publisher. The color of their covers range from blue to red, through purple. On the spine of the majority of the books, in addition to the title, a single letter is printed. It isn\u2019t immediately apparent what the letters mean. They may not be in order. Taking one out to examine it, one would find that the title of each book is handwritten in curvy script on the cover, along with the name of the author, and the words \u2018Copied by Madame Naoki\u2019. Within each book, one would find, as one might expect, the patterns of ink that literate individuals so often interpret as words and thoughts. Interestingly enough, however, it would seem as if, (as stated) Naoki herself has done the physical writing of each book in lieu of contracting a scribe. The composition of the books is an interesting one, depending on how one might interpret it. It would seem to be a mixture of introductory books to certain core concepts, high level works in complex fields that ought to be far beyond the understanding of their intended audience, works of fiction, and books that seem only to be there as a means to teach the children skills they might utilise (harmlessly enough) to Alden\u2019s irritation.

Honestly, she finds it somewhat unsettling how this child- which (most probably) isn\u2019t even tangentially related to her, has inherited so many characteristics that mimic her own. Watching the tip of the quill dip and swerve with each consecutive letter, Naoki wonders if there may be some sort of magic in place. At one point, in her earlier years of reading and research, she had once read a thesis that presented the theory that names- the concept of names, are intrinsically tied to a school of ancient magic, and went on to postulate that one\u2019s given name has a measureable and significant effect on how the individual in question develops as a person. At the time, Naoki had dismissed it as nonsense, just as had everyone else who had read it. But watching this girl\u2026 It leads one to wonder, is all.

After soliciting her rider for directions, Naoki tries the door to Alden\u2019s study and finds it unlocked. Careful not to bump Little Naoki\u2019s head on the doorframe, Naoki proceeds inside and casts an eye about. All in all, Alden\u2019s study seems to be about as one might expect it to be. It features a desk, a table, a few chairs\u2026 aha. The sealing wax, there; on the desk in a tin.Reaching her hands up to grasp her counterpart under the shoulders, Naoki lifts her up, over her own head, and plops her down into the chair just before Alden\u2019s desk. \u201cPut the envelope here, face down.\u201d With one hand, Naoki gestures to the desk\u2019s surface. With the other, she reaches over to the tin, removes the lid, and mercifully enough, finds it to be filled with beads, as opposed to sticks. \u201cNow, this, the process of sealing an envelope with wax, is a bit dangerous; you could singe your little fingers. So allow me to show you how this time, and get your father\u2019s help next time.\u201dAfter Little Naoki has done as instructed, Naoki turns her attention to the candle on Alden\u2019s desk. It is unlit, as it should be, considering fire safety. To remedy this, Naoki reaches into the pouch on her hip and extracts a small, brilliantly cut orange gemstone about the size of her thumbnail. Holding it carefully, she raises it to the unlit candle and activates it, causing a small spurt of magical flame to erupt, lighting the candle and singing her fingers slightly in the process. Though Naoki is careful not to curse aloud, she spends a moment shaking her burned fingers before she slides the gem back into her pouch. Taking the wax spoon in hand, Naoki scoops up a few beads and holds the spoon so Little Naoki can see. \u201cThese little beads are made out of wax. Wax melts easily, hardens quickly, but otherwise isn\u2019t too terribly malleable. That\u2019s why we use it to seal letters, because if someone opens the seal, they can\u2019t close it and make it seem like it was unopened. So what we do is hold the wax over a flame, like this\u2026\u201dNaoki moves the spoon to hold it just above the candle.\u201c... and the wax starts to melt. Don\u2019t get too close.\u201d As they watch the wax melt, Naoki allows a few moments to pass in silence before piping up again, \u201cAnd then, after a short little while, we dump it like this...\u201dSwinging the spoon over, Naoki drops the now-melty pile of wax beads onto the backside of the envelope, in the correct position to be sealed. Setting the spoon off to one side, Naoki takes Alden\u2019s sealing coin and places it atop the wax in the proper position. After that, she moves swiftly to stand behind her counterpart, reaching her arms around, and places one hand on top of the other, and the both of them atop the sealing coin. \u201cNow, quickly, put your hands on top of mine and push!\u201dAfter the stamp is pressed, Naoki would remove her hands, allowing her counterpart to survey their handiwork.

But I care about your daddy very, very much. And all of you. You're everything in this world that matters to me. So as long as you want me to be around, you'll always have your Lyny.

Forcing back the tears that filled her eyes, she descended to the first floor, intending to make her goodbyes to Alden and return home for the night, as unappealing as the idea of sleeping without him was.

But, it's also kind of a difficult thing to pursue. Not everyone is an open book about their lives. So I've refrained from asking people randomly.

It didn't make sense to him but he understood it all the same. Being able to see the reason if not the why of that reason as it were. So he takes a deep breath and begins an abridged version of his story.\"My first memory is of unbelievable pain, a pain so intense that everything that I was before was gone. My second memory is of darkness complete and absolute and of people speaking to me. Telling me that I'd survived that I was ready to begin training in earnest.\" There is a brief pause as he organizes his thoughts with a slight grimace.\"The darkness lasted for a year. I was deprived of sight to help me learn how to use my other senses to detect others. The training was all martial, fighting with every weapon imaginable. Learning how to hit a man in the chest with a throwing knife based on his breathing. Learning how to tell how a man will move in a grapple, based on how his muscles tensed under my touch. Learning to detect where a blow was coming from based on hearing alone. That one was painful I took many beatings before I got good at that. When the bandages were finally taken off of my eyes I found out what caused the pain, they etched runes around my irises. Carving them not just onto the eye, but into my soul. Which was vastly unpleasant. Shortly after I was given sight again I was asked to kill my first man. I was told that he was a complete innocent a new father, he begged to be let go the entire time, begged to see his newborn daughter again.\"There is another pauses as he remembers the event.\"This was a test to see how well the drugs I was being given worked. Since the surgery, they kept me on a dosage. It kept every emotion I had but one surpressed. Wrath. I killed that man as he begged for his life and felt nothing. After that training continued in earnest. My martial training being supplemented with stealth, poisons, acrobatics, and other skills that I would find useful. When I turned fourteen I was deemed ready for the next step I got my body runes. It was excruciatingly painful, if it wasn't for my sheer hatred for the people carving into me I would have bit my own tongue off to escape the pain. It also helped that I had been tortured on a daily basis so I had coping mechanisms for pain. After that training continued for another year, though it included a few additions. The big one would be learning how to fight with broken limbs, which was done by breaking my limbs.\"Another pause as he collects his thoughts.\"After two years of even more intense traing I was deemed ready. Then I was set upon the world. I was Wrath a killing machine that felt nothing, nothing but anger. I was stronger, faster, and more durable than any normal man. A one man strike force sent out to kill those who should have been untouchable. That lasted for... almost seven or eight years. My only comfort during that time was the woman who would stitch me up so that my healing runes would work a little faster. She was kind to me when no one else was though I was to emotionally dead to truly appreciate it. At least until I was ordered to kill her. When I did that I finally snapped. I turned on the people who'd made me what I was, killed all but one of them in that moment. Then I was so consumed with Wrath I slaughtered the entire village we were hiding in men, woman, and children.\"Another pauses longer now as he remembers dark times.\"Still on the last vestiges of my Wrath I tracked down the one that got away. I kept him alive for... I don't know how long, less than a week. He hadn't even been the one in charge, he was just a thief. Shortly after he expired my dosage wore off. For the first time in more than a decade I could feel every emotion I'd had buried. There is a six month gap in my memory after that. Actually I repressed everything I did at the village and only recently got those memories back. I woke up in Medan flat on my face, with only the vaguest memories of who and what I was. I eventually made my way to Isra and fell in with Naoki and her crew. I met a woman who became a sister to me and through her remembered what I did in that village. I returned to bury the dead and a traveling circus showed up. I made two new friends who were with that circus. Takhana our administrator and Cynder whose life I saved and who bore my children. I worked as a Midnight Sun Operative for a time until Naoki was made High Lady. Then I suggested the Sun Marshals as a way to give her operatives more legitimacy.

They did have some skill at actually tending the plants, especially Juney, but mostly they just played while Alden did the bulk of the real work.

Ok think think think. We knows lots of Land-Tiller stories right? Yah, right! Dad used to tell use stories all the time? ... Why am I having trouble remembering them? I'm blanking. We're blanking. They're starting to sit down. They're starting to sit down. And they are sitting. They are staring at us. Uh, uh...Oh!As she racked her brain, she eventually came across a tale concerning the founding of an ancient kingdom. Supposedly the story was true. She had read it in an old series of scrolls which were a part of Lady Naoki's collection. It wasn't actually a fairy tale, but it was close enough.Uh, well, that's technically a historical legend isn't it? So? We'll just throw in some unicorns or something.A part of her felt less nervous fighting against Alden.\"Uh, ok... Story, story... how about... the Fool who Founded a Republic? Ok, so it goes like this. Uh... once upon a time, in a far off land, there was a man. His name was, Lucius the Fool. He was a very nice man, actually very smart, and he liked to read lots of books. But he didn't like to talk, and he was clumsy, so everyone thought he was stupid. He lived in an ancient kingdom called the Land of Wolves. And this kingdom had a king named Lucius the Superb. But the king was mean, and so were his sons. They used to fight a lot, and Lucius the Superb would send armies to go conquer other kingdoms. The people didn't like them very much.\"Jun paused for a moment and rolled her eyes around her head as if looking for the next portion of the story on the ceiling. Apparently she found it, because she continued. \"Ok, now one day Lucius the Superb was about to go on a great campaign, and he wanted to find out how the battles were going to go. So he sent two advisors to visit a wise old oracle who could see into the future. The two advisors decided to bring Lucius the Fool along so he could carry their stuff. Lucius agreed, because he wanted to see the oracle and stuff. So, they traveled a long way, over big green plains and cold mountain ranges and even a stormy ocean, until they made it to an island. That's where the wise old oracle lived. The oracle looked at them and told them that the campaign would go well at first, but that something terrible would happen and the King would lose his kingdom. She said the next king of the Land of Wolves would be one of them, the man who kissed the world's greatest mother, first.\"Jun smiled at herself as the story came easier and easier. \"Now the advisors were excited. They figured all they had to do was go home and kiss their own mothers, because everyone thinks their own mother is the best mom in the world. Whoever did it first would be king, and the other would be made a great general. They decided they would figure out who would be who later and started to go home, and of course they made Lucius the Fool carry their stuff. But Lucius had another idea. Just before they made it to their boat, Lucius pretended to trip and fall. Splat!\" Jun clapped her hands together horizontally to simulate how Lucius fell. \"The advisors knew he was clumsy so they just waited for him to get up. But as soon as Lucius hit the ground, he kissed the dirt. Because he realized that the earth itself was the mother of all life, and therefore the biggest and best mom in the world. And then all three went home.\"\"Now the advisors told the king that the oracle said everything was going to be ok. And so Lucius the Superb went out and started conquering. At first everything was fine, and his sons, who were military leaders, won a bunch of battles. They came home and started celebrating. They took their armies and partied in the streets, in people's houses, in people's yards. They didn't care about anyone, and the people were unhappy. And then something happened. One of Lucius the Superb's sons went into a lady's house and-\" Oh crap. This part's not appropriate for children I forgot! Uh... it's ok, we can fix it. We can fix it! \"-erm, while the husband wasn't home. And he stole her... umm... favorite unicorn!\" I don't think I've ever heard it be called 'stealing the unicorn' before. Shut up me. \"And he ate the unicorn!\"Leaving the children aghast, Jun continued. \"And one of the first people to find out, was Lucius the Fool. That's when Lucius decided to stop pretending to be stupid. He ran out into the streets and he cried out, 'Everyone! The son of Lucius the Superb has done something terrible! He rape- wrap- reaped reaped Lady Lucy's favorite unicorn, and he ate it! Not only that, but his armies have been mean to our people. They don't share the spoils of war! They treat us like nothing. And the king doesn't care! I say we stand up to the king and make him say he's sorry for treating us so badly!' [Jun actually stood up and did a faux macho voice; she looked silly but hopefully the kids would laugh] And so Lucius the Fool lead everyone to march to the great big castle and start yelling at the king. There were so many people that even the army and Lucius' the Superb's personal guard were afraid to stop them. They didn't like him either by the way. And so after arguing and yelling all night, everyone in the castle decided to get rid of the king, and make Lucius the Fool their new king! \"Now the story gets better because, like I said, Lucius the Fool was a very nice man. He realized he didn't want to be a normal king. Instead he wanted to share power with the rest of the people, and stop any one person from becoming too greedy. And so, he created a special group of people called a parliament, which lets the King share power with people. Rich people, poor people, smart people, and yes even dumb people, would get to say what they thought. And he made the people promise to always stand up to a bad king, and only listen to a good king. And, well, that's the story of how Lucius the Fool beat Lucius the Superb and became king. And so the Land of Wolves lived happily ever after... well, for like 300 years, then another bad king showed up and took everything over again and they had to get rid of him too... Hmm...\" History sucks. \"But, yah, how was that? Was that a good story?\" Jun said wide eyed and expectantly.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"Uhh ok?!\" Jun says as she is corralled into the sitting room, desperately trying to cobble together a story for the children in her mind.

Of course, this would be no ordinary gardening lesson!Jun took the kids, Alden, and Thaelyn if she would join them, out to their garden, and pulled out the special bag of seeds.A colorful assortment of objects was starting to become the general trend as Jun revealed the contents to the open air. These were special seeds which had been taken from the Va'nei magical flower field, the festival ground which had played host to the Grand Food Festival. These seeds needed to be planted like regular seeds. But unlike regular seeds, they would grow much, much faster, and have some rather unique and interesting properties.She picked some soft loamy soil and dug a little hole with her finger. The hole went down a precise depth, and she picked a blue seed and planted it. She then covered the seed and watered and fertilized it a precise amount. Then she instructed the children to do the same with the others. The various seeds needed slightly different treatments. Some needed to be placed further away from the others, and some needed a bit more water than the others, and some needed to be planted deeper. Jun kept a particularly close eye on Juniper and Little Naoki, half expecting them to be more proficient at their little project.It only took a few minutes before the seeds began to sprout. Yes, of course, they were magic seeds. The various colors represented different resulting flowery blooms. They ranged from a ferocious starburst of red and yellow to drooping, bell-like blues and purples. Every color of the rainbow was represented at least thrice over.The best part was their properties. Some of them were capable of magnifying the flavors of food greatly. Others were medicinal. And some had silly effects like cause people's mouths to glow chromatically when consumed.There was an unfortunate catch. The seeds were very resource heavy. It look a lot of energy to make the plants bloom in such a short amount of time. The soil in which they were used quickly dried and caked, and the blooms themselves were hot to the touch and needed time to cool off before they could be used. Of course, all it would take was some water and extra fertilizer or an infusion of earthworms to restore the soil.Jun then revealed that most of the seeds were actually small, hard rhizomes which could be harvested from the ground to make more seeds. Some of them were legitimate seeds of course, to be produced by the plant if left unattended for a few days inside peculiar fruiting bodies.With all that said and done, Jun decided to take a moment to extol the virtues of perfectly ordinary, non-magical seeds, for they were the progenitors of these magical seeds and the foundation of all life. Generally fruit that took a long time to grow was also much tastier. The sweet dates in the treats she'd brought, for instance, took many years to produce. Magical seeds were the result of the bond between sapient, magically inclined beings and the natural world as it was.The lecture probably went over the children's heads. But that was ok.

The waltz was the easiest of them all, with only four steps to the basics. One foot forward, right foot up and to the right, left foot meets, and so on.

Indeed, he looked the part of a young lord more or less, after all, he was the same age as her ruggedly handsome with a clean-shaven face and neatly kept if slightly long hair. They begin to practice and Alden picks up on the waltz quickly. He is possessed of a natural grace and dexterity that makes his movements rather fluid. It should also come as no surprise from a man who memorized so many martial katas that he could memorize four steps without difficulty.\"Alright.\"Alden says as she steps away and once she straightens he mirrors the movement.

If she thought to look back before leaving the house she might have seen Alden assuming a dancer's pose as he closes the door. It was clear he'd either enjoyed himself or he really enjoyed practicing new skills.The next few weeks would see their evenings settle into something like a routine. Every evening Kauri would arrive and his children would greet her. They would all spend some time together and she'd get to know each of them in turn. Naoki was named after the empress herself and bore a striking resemblance with her auburn hair and cat-like features. She was also startling intelligent for her age and quite perceptive which might give Kauri some cause for worry considering.Then there was Moonflower who had vibrant bluehair. This particular girl seemed the most interested in Kauri or more specifically Paradise Island. If left alone Moonflower, or Moon Moon as she is sometimes called, would ask a never-ending series of questions all about adventurs Kauri might have had on the monster island.  This was in contrast to Juniper who shared hair color with her sister but seemed quite a bit more reserved. This particular little girl did ask her own questions though, mostly about what kind flowers grew on the island and if encouraged would brag about her planters outside the house which were actually quite nice.Then there were the boys. Caleb and Kaeroen, or Kae as he was normally called, were usually referred to as the twins. This was due to them looking even more alike than the other siblings, with their matching brown hair, height, and features which were quite like their father's. But mostly because they had a similar disposition both seeming obsessed with the idea of becoming heroes, \"just like their dad\" as they put it. Finally, there was Rravarran, or Rawr Rawr as he was usually called. He would take the longest to come out of his shell and he was the proverbial runt of the litter. It would become apparent why he was reluctant to talk when he finally starts talking to \"Kauwi\" by name his lisp being quite obvious. Still, he was an incredibly sweet child and had a great fondness for art, once he warmed up to Kauri he was very eager to share his drawings with her which were quite good for a child of his age.After playtime with the children would come, training in which she'd progressed nicely according to Alden. This was followed by a bath and dinner before they would dance together. Alden had hired a musician for the first week but eventually paid to have a music-making crystal made, something which delighted the children. Todays sparring lesson was a bit different as after putting the children down for bed, instead of leading her to the training room Alden lead her outside. He'd not explain much only that it was time for the \"next stage in her training\" as he leads her to the back of a warehouse.

He tells them of who he'd seen that afternoon, what she'd said, why she said she left, and that she'd promised to visit in the morning. The children's reactions were mixed. Mostly they were incredibly enthusiastic at the thought of finally seeing their mother. However, Little Naoki was a bit skeptical and Rawr Rawr seemed to be almost upset at the thought, sick with worry.

She jumps out of bed and grooms herself in the hot bath that the tavern's staff prepares, her fur taking on its usual azure shine while her brown mane is once again smooth and silky. She checks herself out in the mirror and frowns at her still-ragged appearance, before leaving the inn and paying her due. She spends most of the morning in the market that day, shopping around for the best garment to wear for this auspicious day. About an hour until noon, she completes her task and gets changed, before springing happily onto her wagon, spurring the mules down Riverside Drive. It's time.The sound of hooves and wooden wheels upon cobblestone may be heard outside the house as Cynder slows her wagon down to a halt before the house, looking up at it. Butterflies rush about in her stomach, and she has to focus on her breathing in order to prevent herself hyperventilating. Finally, she composes her mind and swings her legs off the box seat, hopping down onto the stony ground and approaching the house, moving much more slowly than she means to. She reaches the door and stands there for several moments, her hand suspended in the air as she lifts the large steel knocker. Part of her -- specifically her fight or flight response -- tells her to run away, but she resists the urge to follow that base command, and drops the knocker down upon its base three times, a heavy thumping echoing throughout the house. She stands there waiting with her clawed hand-paws wringing themselves behind her back. She's well-groomed and clad in a somewhat conservative black summer dress that, while preserving her decency, certainly hugs her figure in all the right ways. Her dress is accented by the glint of golden jewelry up and down her ears, the same that she wore that day she left, having saved those precious artifacts from the view of her brother and his ilk. Her legs are mostly bare but for a pair of calf-high heeled boots that hug her legs snugly, stylish as well as utilitarian, and made custom for her unique foot-paws by the local cobbler. She presents a beautiful sight, to be sure, having taken pains to look her best for the reunion.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "When Alden leaves, Cynder goes back to her wagon and begins to pack up her thing.

The blue-haired boy stares at Cynder for several long moments then he drops the dragon and rushes to her throwing his tiny body around her leg and hugging it with all the strength his little body can muster. His face is buried into her fur and she'd be able to feel the hot tears running down his face.

Soon they are all trying to hug Cynder, get her to hug them. There was no stream of questions which was unusual for the children. Only a desperate desire to be held by the woman who was supposed to be their mother. Cynder may not realize that one of the children didn't join the hugging mess.

Her features were blank and her eyes empty as she approached the door to the house where she'd once lived, laughed, <i>loved</i>, and tucked the letter calmly into the crack.<br/><br/>Knowing that the wards would quickly alert Alden to the presence of an intruder, as her magical signature was likely no longer worked into them, she spun about and walked briskly away. As soon as she was out of range and had a moment, she viciously bit the fleshy pad of skin at the base of her thumb, and inscribed a transportation circle in her own blood on the floor of an alleyway. Activating it, she vanished to parts unknown, leaving behind the tear-spotted letter and its companion of metal and gemstone. The envelope bore Alden's name in simple script, making it clear who the intended recipient was, and the letter read thus:<br/><br/><div class=\"quote no_header\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><i>Alden,<br/><br/>I guess I should start off saying I'm sorry. I didn't explain why I left. Not really. I guess it doesn't matter now, anyway. I saw you, with her. You looked happy. Are you happy? I hope you're happy. You deserve it, if anyone does. Anyway, this doesn't belong to me anymore. You know, I never took it off. I mean yes I put it on a chain, to keep it safe, and keep it close to my heart. To remind me of what I was living for and what I had to come home to. I was just trying to keep you safe, you and the kids. I wouldn't have left for any other reason. They were killing the orphans, trying to draw me out, and I couldn't risk them finding you, hurting you...<br/><br/>I doubt they remember me, but if they do, don't tell the kids about this. Let them think I died. It'll be easier for everyone. And please don't look for me. I don't want to be found.<br/><br/>I'll never forget you.<br/><br/>Love,<br/>Thaelyn</i><div class=\"quote_clear\"></div></div></div></br></font>"}, "post-92752": {"user": "Flann", "user_num": 3542, "timestamp": "1564366077000", "message": "Isra, she had only ventured to the city proper a handful of times, navigating the narrow waterways that snaked their way from Silverion River to the city center was difficult work, not to mention the waters that flowed through the channels were often less than suitably clean for swimming, let alone breathing.

The crystalline waters, ornate stone work, and peaceful shore side windowsills were gorgeous, they made her envious for what she had lost, no longer able to enjoy such a serene scene from inside one of these quaint little houses, even if she could afford one. It made her nostalgic, for the seaside home she had left behind, and the nagging thought that her father likely would've loved to move them to a house like this as his career in the burgeoning nation began to take off in his later years. She sighed softly, bubbles rising up from her lips. She swam upwards, breaking from beneath the gently moving river currents to pop up on the water's surface, focusing on her feet and making them excessively buoyant with her newfound magical powers, so she could easily walk upon the water's surface for a moment. It seemed the water's path would grace her with a distraction from these somber lingering thoughts, as she was quickly pulled from her pondering by the muffled sound of voices The curious girl craned her neck to follow the sounds, the tentacles on her head shifting to point in the direction of the sound, bobbing up and down in an almost anxious manner, as they did when she was surprised.Her bright blue eyes found purchase on a curious, admittedly cute sight. Children, she could count six in total, all crowded around a vista of little windows in the side of one of the stonebrick houses on the river's edge. They were looking back at her, or at the least, looking out into the river. She gave a little wave, her fingers waggling gently as she brightly smiled in their direction.

Her tail flicks back and forth slowly her blue cat ears perked up in interest. Their father had just returned home and was currently in the bath. With nothing to do until they could pester him the children were in the living room which had a large bay window that overlooked the river. \"There's a what? Like someone swimming?\"Caleb says as he walks over and peers out the window next to his sister. His hair and ears were brown and he was the spitting image of his father in many ways. Especially lately as he and Kae seemed to be going through a bit of a growth spurt. They were now a full two inches taller than their sister's something they loved to lord over them.\"Oh wow, no she's really just walking! GUYS, COME LOOK!\"The boy begins to bounce up and down in excitement before his hands fly to the window's latch, he starts working on undoing it. While he is doing this the other four children approach. Blue haired Junie and brown-haired Kae approach the window first staring out at the site of the lady on the water with wide-eyed fascination. Following up behind is Rawr Rawr who, as usual, clutches his dragon plushie tight to his chest. It had once been nearly the same size he was but he'd grown a bit over the years and now it was only about two thirds his size. He worries the ear of it gently with his teeth as he waits for his sister and brother to make room, which they do.\"Caleb, stop that.\"The final child approaches, carrying herself like a miniature matriarch as she swats at her brother's hands. She was also a brunette but with golden eyes that shone fiercely as she stares down her brother. \"Ow, what was that for Naoki?\" Caleb protests and his sister snorts.\"You were going to jump.\" She declares and before her brother can protest she makes a cutting motion with her hand. \"You weren't just going to look or say hi. It was going to be like that time you swore you saw a silver sword in the water, even though I told you it was just a fish. You were going to jump and daddy is going to have to rescue you again.\"Caleb glares at his sister in silence for a long moment but finds he can't truly protest since she was right. He was also remembering almost drowning and deciding that he wasn't eager to repeat it. \"Hey, where's Moon Moon?\"He says instead and Naoki blinks realizing their sister is missing. After a moment's thought the brown-haired girl knows exactly where to go.\"HI! I'M MOON MOON, WHO ARE YOU?\" The blue-haired girl bounced out of the back door of the house, bounding down the little garden path and pulling up short at the wood and stone embankment of the river. She is wearing a massive smile as she stares out at Flann, her eyes sparkling with childlike wonder and curiosity at the octopus woman. A moment later her siblings are piling out of the door to introduce themselves.\"I'M CALEB!\" \"I'M KAE!\" \"I'm Juniper nice to meet you.\" \"I'm Waw Waw.\" \"He's Rawr Rawr, I am Naoki.

She masked her laughter with the hand she had lifted to wave at them. She could just barely hear their excited little voices within, and as the window creaked open, the murmurs grew into a cacophony of excitement. This was more than a welcome change from the reactions she often elicited around Isra. Not all were accepting of 'unnatural' creatures or their curious features. It was an almost daily occurrence around the port to be threatened, mocked, or scorned, most often by incoming foreigners, but she got her fair share of cruel treatment from Isranian residents as well. The children were nothing like that, whether due to a pureness of their minds and souls of prejudice and judgment, or an admirable parentage which encouraged empathy and acceptance, the young nereid was absolutely tickled to get such a warm response from the young ones. Flann lurched forward, her brows bowed as excitement soured to concern, one of the young boys who had opened the window latch seeming to ready himself to jump out and into the waters below. Relief washed over her as one of his (presumed) sisters quickly moved in to dissuade him from the decision. She seemed exceedingly mature for her age, a dependable older sister figure...though they all appeared to be about the same age. As easily caught up in the commotion as the children inside seemed to be, Flann was completely unaware of the approaching adventurous young girl until the house's back door burst open and a chipper little greeting was screamed at her. This prompted the skittish squid-girl to hop back on the water's surface, landing with two little ripples as her feet hit the water's surface a few inches back as she clutched her chest tightly. Another relieved sigh hissed from her lips, the tension taught in her shoulders and tentacles falling slack once more.She greeted the girl with another wave and a nod. The young blunette was beyond charming, and it's only at this point that she's really able to notice the equally unusual animal qualities the children seem to possess. This would explain why they made no fuss over her strange appearance. Flann dove beneath the water's surface, swimming down for a fresh 'breath' and to hydrate her skin, re-emerging just a few feet from the embankment. She crouched down, albeit not far considering her naturally petite frame, to stand about eye level with the kids on the surface of the stream. \"Moon...Moon? What an...interesting name! It's very cute, suits ye, I think. My name's Flann, it's nice to meet ye.\" She remarked, a little giggle punctuating her words as she was overwhelmed with delight at how friendly and sweet the girl seemed. Just then, the other children came flooding out of the house like an adorable crashing wave. Before she could even take in what was happening they started listing off their names in order, like some sort of rehearsed routine, which Flann desperately nodded along to, following with a pointed index and softly repeating each name under her breath as she tried to get them all straight. \"Right, it's nice to meet you all! I...think I caught all yer names. Aren't you lot just precious? Oh I'm absolutely tickled by ye. I'm Flann, I hope I didn't worry yous passing by the house. I'm just uh...out for a walk? I guess a swim is more accurate.\" she remarked, her hands tightly clutched together as she fawned over them, grinning ear to ear.Following their little introduction, the smart one...Naoki, she strained to find the name, followed up with a question. Flann tilted her head curiously, and then looked down at herself, brows shooting up as she realized what exactly the girl was asking about. She'd grown quickly accustomed to being able to walk with the water, it was sometimes easy to forget it wasn't exactly something most people could do. Flann raised an index as she moved to explain. \"I'd say it's pretty magic, naw? I certainly couldn't do this before I...well, before I turned into this...and that was definitely magic, what made me like this. So I guess by proxy, that'd also make this magic.\" she remarked, her confident start quickly sputtering out as she realized she really was only slightly more sure about it than the girl asking the question was. Wanting to recover from her blunder, Flann sprouted wide eyes and a bright smile. She gently extended a hand towards the kids. \"Would ya like to give it a try?\" she offered, brows bunched up high once again as she waited for the whimsy reactions of the more daring among them.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The house began to bustle and bloom with life, wonder, and movement as the children began to scramble their way towards the window, prompting a wide eyed shock from Flann, which quickly broke into a charmed little laugh.

Flann was correct there was something of a ritual to the introduction, one that ends when she gives her name and the children chorus, almost as one.\"It's nice to meet you Flann.\"Evidently, someone had been teaching them proper manners or at least trying to. The niceties were observed in between bouts of childish excitement to ask questions and make new friends. For of course the children were hoping to make a new friend today as they always hoped to do when they met someone new. \"You changed into this?\" Naoki says clearly intrigued as she steps a bit closer to the embarkment to gaze at Flann with even more curiosity than before. \"And you gained power from it? That's quite impressive. Auntie Naoki, she's the empress and I am named after her, anyway, Auntie Naoki gave me a book on transformation magic and to change someone's physiology to such an extent is no mean feat.\" The girl certainly did have an air about her and evidently with good reason since she was trying to live up to quite the personage in her namesake.\"Yeah!\"The two brunette boy's and Moonflower interrupt their sister when Flann makes her offer of trying to walk on water. It was quite apparent that these three were the trouble makers of the lot, the ones most eager and most likely to jump first and ask questions later. Fortunately, Naoki seemed to have a cool enough head to keep them in line as she immediately turns to them and says.\"Don't go jumping into the river with a person we just met! At least, not until Daddy is out of his bath.\" The three children who'd seemed eager to try, give Naoki a sullen look, however, she turns to Flann.\"Sorry, it's as much for your safety as ours. Who knows what Daddy might do if he finds us playing in the river with a stranger without permission. He can be very strict when it comes to our safety.\"The way she speaks of her father seems to imply that Flann should have some idea of who he is in the way on a child can manage.

Flann let out a little squeal of delight as they all spoke in uniform approval of meeting her. It was precious, they were such well behaved kids, she couldn't even imagine what their parents must be like. This was a nicer part of town as well, was she meeting aristocracy right now? Her heart started to thump firmly at the thought, so she did her best to push the possibility from her mind. It seemed her best attempts to avoid said nagging thought would be almost immediately dashed as little Naoki opened her mouth to speak. At first the girl seemed to completely glance over the mention. \"Aye, yer Auntie Naoki is right, it's certainly-\" and then suddenly her eyes went so wide they threatened to pop from the sockets, her pupils pinned, skin white as the rushing rapids, her tentacles standing straight up on end. \"Y-Y-YER AUNTIE'S THAT NAOKI?! EMPRESS NAOKI?! Oh, you've gotta be coddin' me lassie, taken years off my life pulling that out of nowhere!\" She cried, collapsing to her knees, now sitting upon the river's surface, her legs folded under her, hands tightly gripping her chest as she tried to still her heart from it's thunderous drumming. After nearly a full minute of muttering and sputtering she composed herself enough to speak again, dipping down into the water once more for another full breath before resurfacing. \"Now...ah, forgive me. Ye did me a fright is all, I feel like I've gone and insulted the whole empire speaking like some commoner to you lot. Please, my most gracious apologies to any offense I've given ya in my short time speaking with ye. I'm a stupid girl from Taingaard, still not all too familiar with Isra.\" she said, bowing her head gently to the kids. She really had no idea how to address them, so did her absolute best to remain cordial and proper.\u00a0\"As fer yer question, if I can even remember it right, yes. I did change into this, and as you've said, it is certainly no small feat to make such a wild transformation, at least as well as I know. That's why only a god could do it...well, I'd like to think they're a god anyway. A sea god, one who watches out for maidens lost to the harsh waves. It is...a long story, and a sad one. I think you'd prefer I not tell it.\" she explained, a solemn smile on her slim lips as she fought to mask the pain those memories brought her from Naoki and her siblings. It seemed in the time between Naoki dropping the bombshell about their lineage and the time it took Flann to recover, the kids had already discussed and decided it best to not take her up on her offer to let them try out her powers just yet. She'd missed that little interaction, but was privy to Naoki's following warning, giving an affirming nod in agreement. \"Aye, ye should be careful around strangers and yes, if you're aunt is the empress then that'd mean your da is...\" the curious girl searched upwards, gesturing her finger back and forth sporadically as she quickly traced a mental family tree of Isra's nobility and what she knew of the families. That same drained paleness and hollow fear returned to her face. \"High Marshal Alden.\"The man was all too familiar to her, stories about him carried far, and while her father usually brought home tales of Isran's nautical heroes, she had certainly heard the name Alden Marshal a handful of times, particularly when it came to his heroic slaying of titanous beasts. She could feel her heart racing once again, eyes now glued to the back door of the house. She could only pray that he didn't see this little social as a threat to his young ones, or she'd end up dead a second time, and this time it'd be a lot more...visceral than drowning at sea.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<b>\"Moonflower ay?

The children giggle as Flann overreacts to the news of who their auntie is. It wasn't cruel giggling though, just the amused giggling of children watching an adult act silly. \"You don' have to apowogize.\" Says the little blue-haired boy, Rawr Rawr, he looks at her fretfully. He was the only child who'd not laughed seemingly more concerned that Flann might be distressed than anything else. To be fair, it was understandable that Flann had not figured out this was the house of such an esteemed person right away. While it was a nice house in a good neighborhood, it was more in line with something a well off merchant might own. It did not scream that this was the abode of arguably the most dangerous and powerful man, just as arguably the second most powerful person, in the Isran Empire.\"Rawr Rawr is right.\" Naoki says, she was the first to regain her composure and once she had she did her best to sound like an adult. \"We aren't offended by your manner in the slightest. We are all quite happy to have met you Miss Flann.\" There is a chorus of agreement and cheers at that. Well and one request that she make her tentacles do the standing up straight thing again as it had been funny. The mention of the story, even a sad one, had the exact opposite reaction that Flann was likely hoping for since all of the children got closer. \"You met a god?\" \"There is a story?\" \"I wanna hear the story!\" They flick their tails, ears perking up. Of course, children wanted stories, it was one the best ways to get their attention.Before she could get a chance to tell her tale, a voice sounds from behind the children. It was a low tenor, masculine and gilled with steady calm. \"Children, who is your new friend?\" There was only one person the voice could belong to. The High Marshal Alden Marshal of Isra had appeared on the scene without creating a single sound, his bright green eyes moving over the children before settling onto Flann.He did not look particularly intimidating. He wasn't exceptionally tall and didn't look exceptionally strong, he had the lithe lean frame of a sword fighter but the loose-fitting silk tunic and black leather riding pants did little to put his physique on display. He looked young, not even out of his twentieth year, his features angular and strong. Alden looked more like an utterly unremarkable handsomish nobleman rather than a monster-slaying warrior. Yet there was this air about him that one could not deny as they stared upon him. Something in the way he held himself, in the way he moved, that bespoke power and grace in equal measure, that spoke of the deadly elegance of a predator. This impression was somewhat ruined for Flann a moment later when six cat-eared children let out, in unison, an ear-piercing exclamation of delight and swamped the man as they cried out. \"Daddy!\" \"This is Flann!\" \"She can walk on water!\" \"She says we can walk on water with her!\" Can we? Can we please?\" The High Marshal is brought to his knees to he can be hugged and pestered by his children a smile on his face as he greats them.However, that smile fades when his gaze lands on Flann and while his eyes don't get hard they do demand an answer to the question he'd voiced earlier. He wanted to know just who Flann was and what she was doing on the river and she'd likely know it was in her best interests to answer promptly and truthfully.

Honestly, the whole group of them seemed somewhat keen and emotionally in tune, it was the kind of knowing reassurance she expected from an adult of stature, not a group of children. Naoki was soon to calm herself from the fit of giggling and chirp in with similar sentiments as her brother, though of course recounted in a much more eloquent manner. Flann fanned her cheeks with flapping hands, still fighting to bring herself down from the surprise. Her smile grew even wider as Naoki remarked that they had enjoyed meeting her, followed by the rapturous agreement of the others. \"Thank goodness, I'm so glad I haven't just made a fool of myself in front of nobility. I've very much enjoyed meeting you lot as well, you're all such sweet kids, it's done me more good than I could put to words, even if ye did nearly scare me out of my skin.\" she remarked, a little laugh of her own following the joke she made at her own expense. It had been admittedly difficult to hear endless news about her missing father, the lack of leads, the dead ends, the time toiled away at ports and docks and markets trying to glean anything she could use. The treatment she received for her appearance was another crushing weight on top of that, and she had no real family or friends in Isra. It had all been starting to wear on her, as much as she refused to admit it. This sweet, serene meeting with the children had been no small gesture to the nereid. On the contrary, it gave her some hope, and a sense of connection that had been sorely lacking.Flann forced a pained smile onto her face as the children began excitedly hopping around, demanding she share her sad story with them. In truth she wasn't exactly sure if she was emotionally prepared to speak of it to anyone at great length, and it was far from a children's tale...but...she knew she would most definitely have a harder time saying no to their bright, excited expressions. It would be like a knife to the heart to see disappointment on their little faces.\u00a0It seemed for the immediate future, she would be able to defer their request, though what had replaced it seemed no less emotionally daunting to the young girl. Seemingly from nowhere, the infamous Alden Marshal appeared, she had only taken her eyes from the house for a moment, and yet, he had crept up to stand with the kids in complete silence. He didn't exactly look the way her father's stories had painted him, nor how his reputation would seem to suggest. He appeared like a more or less normal man. He was young, fairly attractive, about average height, with a slim frame. This was a far shot from the towering monster slaying beast of a man she had been expecting, though in some ways, this almost made him more intimidating. He radiated a powerful, frightening aura. She didn't feel threatened, but she certainly could get a defensive menacing coming off of him. The maiden took a deep bow at the waist as he approached, wanting to show her respect for his status, and also desperate to do whatever she could to keep her head. She rose once more after several seconds, a slim smile tugging the corners of her tightly pursed lips as she watched the kids crowd around him and relay her many interesting features and acclaims to their father. It was precious, to see the way the children so excitedly spoke to their father, and the patient kindness he seemed to listen to them with. He was far more...domestic, than she would ever have guessed.The heartwarming moment was quickly dashed as Alden then affixed his dagger gaze on her. Flann shrunk into herself some, it was clear now he expected her to answer for herself. She hoped her answers would be sufficient enough to assuage his concerns about her, or she'd be paying dearly for it. \"H-High Marshal Alden, please forgive me fer the intrusion.

It was not a broad smile, but it was real, warm and genuine. It made his features less severe and dimmed the aura of danger around him somewhat. There is a sense that the man was far too on guard for it to ever go away entirely, but he seemed to have relaxed somewhat.\"It's nice to meet you Flann.\"Alden says his tone and words almost an exact match for the way his children had greeted her earlier.

Can we please!?!\" Comes the chorus from the three rambunctious youths and surely the other three would want a turn once they see how much fun they could have.\"She was going to tell us a story!\" Protests Naoki. \"I want to hear the story first!\" The little empress demands and there is a sense that both Juniper and Rawr Rawr agree with her though they are a bit too shy to speak up about it.Alden's response is to extend his flattened palm and bring it down in a calming gesture. The effect is immediate as the children silence themselves, there is no sign of fear on their features as this happens so it is clear that whatever parenting technique he'd used to engender such discipline it wasn't brought about by cruelty. \"I think it is your new friend's decision what if anything she would like to do next. She is a person, not a plaything children.\" Alden turns his attention back to Flann and offers her another small smile. \"I know you said you were walking to clear your head so do not feel as though you need to trouble yourself on their account.\"Of course, the children do not openly voice their objection to this but they do turn the full force of their adorableness on Flann. It is clear that though they won't cry there would be dissapointed faces if she decided to just leave, despite what their father had said.

He didn't seem like such an imposing figure any longer, though she could not help herself from the fixation on acting and carrying herself in a more...proper manner in his presence. Flann masked a giggle with her hand as the children erupted once more with excitement, the wonder in their voices warmed her heart, and she could only hope their father would indulge them a bit, allowing her to continue on her little meet and greet with them. At first it seemed he would dash their hopes, their voices silent with a single gesture, reinforcing her impression of the family as well discipline. Then however, Alden not only seemed to encourage their interest in the nereid, but actually deferred to her to decide how to proceed, paying careful mind to what Flann had mentioned of her purpose here. She was impressed by both his empathy and attention to detail, and she showed it on her face, a mix of surprise and appreciative glee. Flann quickly waved a dismissive hand as Alden's focus turned to her and prompted her to decide what she felt comfortable with sharing with the children. \"Naw, it's quite alright. On the contrary, speaking with yer little ones has done me a great deal of good in distracting me from my thoughts. Besides, how could I say no to faces like those?\" she remarked with a sly smile towards the kids. Flann scooched herself up to the edge of the embankment and sat down once more right in front of the kids. She waved directing hands towards them, beckoning them to crowd around and sit with her, if she was going to tell the story, she wanted to set up a proper little story time. \"Alright wee ones, if ya really want to hear the tale, then I suppose I could tell ye, but again I've got to warn ye...this is not a fun story.\" she cautioned, her voice becoming far more serious and almost wispy as she set into the mood these memories evoked in her. \"Ah, actually-\" she quickly looked up to Alden. \"Marshal, this story is...somewhat dark.

With their father there to remind them that people were not toys no matter how much they might be willing to go along with the whims of adorable youngsters. However, it was plain on their features that this would not last forever as they were all practically bursting with excitement with whatever it was they wanted to blurt out.\"See!\" \"She wants to play with us!\" \"Let's plaaaaaaaaaaay.\" \"I want to hear her story!\"The children almost immediately start arguing when Flann gives them thanks and Alden's voice cuts through without him raising it. \"Children, she was still talking. The next one to interrupt is going back inside.\"Silence falls immediately though now there is a bit of a pout going on as well. Their father appeared to promote good manners though it was obvious they wanted off the leash. When Flann finishes explaining that her tale was quite dark The High Marshal gives her a remote, almost unreadable expression as he cocks his head to one side.\"What favor would I be doing them if I shielded them from the sadness in this world?\"Well, she wasn't to know it yet Alden's parenting style was not quite the orthodox one, especially for this day and age. Complete honesty when it came to matters of the world and why he asked things of them was far from normal. Alden had never once used the, because I said so, argument with his children. Always explaining why he asked what he did of them and when disobedience occurred, well he believed that actions had consequences and he'd always strived to ensure his children understood this as well. Even when said consequences were being imposed by their father to ensure that they were being polite. All told, it was effective especially as his children half-cat nature had lead to them maturing quite a bit faster than they might have otherwise.  \"Please, tell your tale,\" Alden says looking at the children who all soon take a cross-legged seat mirroring their father looking at Flann with barely constrained enthusiasm. \"Then, should you still be up for it.

A slender smile on her lips, she quite liked that thought. It reminded her some of her own father, who never shied from a harsh lesson or a frightening story in her youth. Her eyes broke from his for a moment as that memory burned in her breast, further silence giving the children plenty of time to calm themselves and gather around her at the water's edge.\"Yer a smart man, Marshal. I think you'll raise a right good group of kids, teaching them like ye have.\" She commented, looking up at him once more, she gave an approving nod. The marshal than prompted her to continue, and then offered to continue watching over the group as she made good on her promise to share her powers with the little ones, a bright smile returning to her face at the prospect of doing so. She could sense just how much they would revel in the experience, her own anticipation bringing a bit of excitement to the young sea maiden. \"Aye, thank ya Marshal Alden. I think that'd be an absolute delight, I look forward to it. But first...the story.\" she remarked, her jovial demeanor melting away, a much more serious expression washing over her, she almost looked like a different person as she took in a heavy breath and prepared herself to share the story. A dozen thoughts ran through her mind, where to start, how to say it in a way the children would understand, find interesting, if she even could say a lot of what had to be said to fill in all the details. With no clear guidance in sight, she felt it best to just...start.\"This story, it's really not my story. Not wholly, anyway. Naw, this story is about my da. Now, my old man was a real interesting fella. He was a sea captain, a soldier. Ever since I was a wee lass he would sail off to sea to go and fight pirates. At first, he did it on his own, but by the time I was getting to be yer ages, he moved to working for the East Isran company, down in Silverion. I loved my da a whole lot, just like you lot probably love yer own. He was such a sweet man, treated me like I was his favourite person in the whole wide world, made me feel...he made me feel like I was worth all the effort he put into raising me.\" she started, a sad smile twitching at the corners of her lips, she could not bear to meet eyes with the children, she knew she would start tearing up if she had, so she looked over their heads, or down into the river below. Flann swallowed a heavy lump and continued on.\"Well, I'm sure, based on what yer father's said, that you lot know the risk that comes with soldiering. Nobody can win all of the time, and while my da was a great warrior, sooner or later, he was going to lose a battle. I can still remember the morning those Isran company ships came floating up to the little docks next to our seaside home, can remember my heart sinking down into my stomach, like someone was tugging at my insides with tight little fingers. I went running fer the docks as fast as my feet could carry me. That was oh...two...three years ago now? The company soldiers docked and approached me and my ma, who had lagged behind on the docks, but she'd come running too. They told us...\" she paused, a sharp breath in through either nostril, Flann bit down hard on her lip, her large lashes fluttering as she tried to keep tears from coming.\"They told us his ship had up and disappeared. Pirates, they reckoned, had sank his ship somewhere far from Isran's waters. My father had a habit of chasing down fleeing crews, scrappy old kook never knew when to quit...but that's why I knew...it just...it couldn't be true. My ma was destroyed, she sobbed every night after that, at first, I cried too but...what good was crying doing us? The company men said pretty much fer certain he was dead, by my da would never let himself get outdone by pirates or some sea storm, not if it meant never coming home to us again. I knew- know...he's still out there somewhere.\" she continued, her face firm, brows furrowed as she boldly asserted her surety about his status as alive. It was tainted by some deep look of desperation, Flann needed what she believed to be true, and reaffirming her belief in those feelings was often all that kept her going anymore. It sounded as though she was trying to convince herself as much, or more, as her audience.\u00a0\"After that, I knew I had to go looking for him. My ma begged me not to go but...naw, I was dead set on seeing this through. My dad has taught me just enough sailing and left just enough coin fer me to set out on a little excursion of my own. Don't right know what came over me, what I was thinking, setting out like that. I'd rarely ever left our homestead and the little village down the way, and all the sudden, I was on an old fishing boat headed for Isra's waters, a place I'd never been on a ship I'd barely sailed. Naturally...well, it didn't turn out fer me too well.\" she continued simply. Her pain deepened, her eyes now cloudy, hollow, like she was staring somewhere far away. The tears started to come then, gently rolling down from the corner of either eye.\"The sea was churning something fierce, the waves were as tall as great towering trees, cracks of thunder overhead wouldn't stop, and the rain was bucketing down. It was the most scared I'd ever been in my whole life, clutching onto the edge of the deck, screaming fer my crew to somehow save us from the horrible situation I'd gotten us all into. I felt right stupid then, but my fear over powered my self hatred. Suddenly, everything went black, a wave had swept over the boat and pulled us down into the black of the raging sea. It was horrifying. I couldn't...I couldn't tell which way was up, which were down, the salt stung my eyes, and after sinking down, down down...I start to feel a burning in my lungs, like I'd swallowed fire. They were filling up with water and I just...sat their...sinking, praying, screaming muffled screams fer...fer my da...to come and save me.\" she explained, the words empty, dribbling out as she relived each and every moment. She fell silent for nearly a minute, before she came back to her senses. The girl quickly moved to wipe her eyes with her sleeve, her tentacle wrapping around her head as she tried to shield herself from sight.\"Ah blast, sorry, I'm sorry I didn't mean to get so riled up! Please I'm ah...I'm alright, don't you lot worry!\" she sputtered out, quick to try and salvage some of her dignity and assuage the children of whatever worries or concerns were brewing in their little hearts and minds. She didn't want to burden them with her grief, and she certainly didn't want to look fool in front of the marshal. She moved her hands away took a sharp breath as she fought to regain her composure, fanning at her face with a flat hand, taking just a moment to recover.\u00a0 ", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Flann watched silently as the marshal went about instructing his kids, surprised with how calm and composed he could be when disciplining them.

There was something there, some unspoken trouble but she fell quiet soon after.By the time that Flann was down the children looked ready to cry. Indeed, Rawr Rawr and Juniper were crying already. It was quite clear that their little hearts were bursting with sympathy for the poor girl and as one they mob her. It is a bit difficult since they could only get to her from one side what with the river. But Flann would soon find six children doing their best to hug her without falling into the river. \"That's so sad!\" \"I would never want to lose my daddy!\" \"Our daddy will help you find yours!\" \"I'm sorry!\"The children were not even quite sure what to say but they were quite intent on making sure that Flann knew that they felt bad for her and wanted to help.

It is a sad story, but it has a happy ending...I hope anyway. Should we get to the good part?\" she asked, pulling away from her embrace to give them her bright smile and an encouraging nod.

She cocked an eyebrow and looked to the marshal, for just a moment or two, before returning her focus to the kids. She wondered if he really might help her, he was a government official after all, he did have a far wider reach than she could ever possibly pull for herself. She would not be so rude as to pursue such a momentous request herself, but if he offered...she certainly would not refuse.With that thought lingering, and the sweet sentiments of the children who only wanted to see her happy once again, she continued with the final bit of her tale, hoping it would finish off the story with a bittersweet note of hope. \"After I started..well...drowning, I guess, I thought fer sure I was done for. But then...something truly magical happened. I could hear whispering in my ear. A gentle voice, it echoed through the water all around me, like whale calls. It spoke a language I don't right think I know...and yet, I could understand it. It told me not to worry, that it would watch over me from now on, that the sea had no hatred for maidens lost to it's depth. Then I felt hands. Warm, impossibly soft, gentle hands, and the little light I could see streaking down from the surface of the sea was shadowed by this...womanly figure, hair flowing all about in the water. The next thing I knew, I was resting in the shallows on Isra's coast, the tides lapping over me. I had survived, and suddenly I had become...well...this. Tentacles and all. It gave me a right fright the first time I saw my reflection, but I realized pretty quick that I'd been saved by some gentle sea spirit, and that turning into this was...well, it was my salvation. Now I can explore the oceans as much as I want without a problem!\" She exclaimed, sweeping her arms back towards the river to try and emphasize her point. She was free from fear of the ocean depths, she could explore, try to find her father, without any further worries of being lost at sea. She had given up her life on land...but the gift the sea spirit had given her put her closer to finding him than anything else could've.Flann gave a little nod of her head, almost like a bow, as she finished her story with that final note. \"I hope it wasn't too sad for you lot, please, don't be discouraged. What I think ye should take away from it is...never give up. I'm choosing not to give up, I was given a second chance. Second chances are everywhere in life, don't be afraid to make a mistake or two. That's my message, I think...anyway.\" she remarked, trying to somehow spin the story into something more positive or beneficial to the young ones.

However, she manages to get an expression out of him. It was one of amused bemusement. She was acting as though he was offering her great wealth or some magical artifact when the simple reality was, he was just offering to do what she was doing herself. It would cost him nothing and might help her a great deal. Of course, he knew why she was saying it he'd long ago learned that people were stuck in their own perspective and didn't grasp that sometimes what seemed monumental to them was nothing to another. When Flann declares that she would come to visit again the children erupt into excited cheers and pleading for permission for their new friend to do so. The High Marshal's bemused expression remains fixed and he shrugs to Flann. \"Evidently.\" He begins as his gaze moves over the children. \"You can quite easily repay me by making my children happy, simply by returning to collect what I have offered.\" There were few things he valued more than his children's happiness and nothing made them happier than a new friend. \"I'm surprised you didn't hear, it was the talk of the town a year ago,\" Alden says with a shrug of his shoulders. The children's attention immediately fixates on him and it is clear that this is a favorite story.  \"There is little enough to tell, an island off the coast that had a community of shipwreck survivors, they had to be evacuated, and the refugees set up a market near the river.\" The moment Alden finishes telling the abridged version the children begin to make a ruckus.\"Daaaaaaaaaaaddy!\" \"That's not the story!\" \"Tell it right!\" \"Yeah! Tell her about the monsters!\" \"Tell her about Kauri!\"\u00a0Alden looks at the kids and cocks an eyebrow. His expression is a bit more animated, it was that of a father who was thinking about saying: Did you not just get a story? But then he sighs and, offering Flann a small smile begins the story properly.\"It was about a year ago when a young woman named Kauri Graves arrived at the door of the Sun Marshal's HQ. I was just leaving for the day and seeing a young woman exhausted and clearly distressed I decided to offer her some assistance. She told me she was from Paradise Island, part of an archipelago just off the Isran coast that was thought to uninhabited. From Kauri we learned that the island was actually extremely magical in nature and that many ship wreck survivors wound up stranded there. The magic of the island would cause mutations and many who found themselves changed opted to stay.\"A brief pause as the children wiggle in excitement. \"Kauri told me that her village was in dire straits as the children were disappearing. Seeing as it had been some time since I was in the field myself and most of my Marshals were out on mission, I offered to help her myself. I did not think it would take very long.\" He chuckles and the children are practically bouncing in excitement.\"After letting the children know I would be gone for a few days I had us teleported to the island, or well as close as we could get, the magical interference meant we landed a few hundred meters from shore. Once on the island it did not take me overly long to figure out where the children were taken. A cave and within was a beast that was using crystals to enslave them. Accompanied by a small hunting party from the village we went in to deal with the beast. I slew it by climbing to the ceiling of the cavern and dropping a massive crystal stalactite upon it.\"The children cheer at this. Their father didn't have much flare for story telling, his delivery rather to the point, but they clearly loved his tales regardless. \"When we exited the cave we were quickly set upon by a giant serpent that rose out of a poisonous marsh that was between us and the village. I slew it with my enchanted blades, although it managed to drag me into the marsh with it. I had to have Kauri lead me to some fresh water after that.\"He smiles at the memory of that encounter and Juniper giggles. \"Daddy is courting Kauri now.\" Alden gives the girl a fond pat on the head and continues his story. \"After that we returned to the village but there was another disturbance. A great deal of magical force was causing a mighty storm to brew up. It had become abundantly clear that whatever magical force was on the island wanted the village gone. It summoned up a massive avatar and set it upon the village. I called in The Depravity.\" Flann would likely know that this is the flagship of the Isran Navy.\u00a0\"To save the villagers while I did battle with the avatar. I was about to slay it as well, when another creature of the island appeared. This one was different, smaller and more intelligent. It bargained for the life of the avatar in exchange for allowing me to evacuate the refugees in peace.\" A frown draws across his features. \"I was not happy with the bargain as I dislike anything that kills people under my protection and the avatar did manage to do some damage, but I acquiesced and we escaped Paradise Island.\"The children erupt into cheers once again, it was clear they'd heard this tale before and would likely ask to hear it again many times more in the future.

He was wholly underselling what he was doing for her, and she disliked his attempts at doing so. This was a favour of such important magnitude for her that she never wanted to downplay its importance. It was the best chance she had at finding her father, and he had just gifted it to her like it was nothing. She would remember the kindness for the rest of her life.Fortunately it seemed he would take her assertion more seriously following the bright, excited cheers of his kids, which softened her own expression as she tilted her head their way, a glowing smile creeping it's way onto her face. She gave a nod as Alden explained that her repayment could come in the form of visiting the kids once again, something she would do happily, even if it weren't to follow up on information about her father. \"Of course, I'd be absolutely delighted to. Yer family warms my heart, coming to visit is the least I could fer ya. I could watch them fer ye some time, if ya ever needed a bit of respite from the kids!\" she offered with a chipper excitement in her tone, reveling in the thought of babysitting the lovely little family, something which carried a bit more value potential than just a visit. She would do right by this family, whatever it took. It was then time for the tale about Paradise Island, a story which seemed to excite the kids as they insisted on telling the story 'properly', something which piqued the girl's interest, and had her fighting a delighted little giggle as Alden yielded quickly to their demands. Flann listened closely, her eyes wide as Alden recounted the story of the island and all sorts of heroic feats he conquered to save the people trapped there. Surely this was the origin of the stories her father had mentioned or shared in passing, but she could hardly believe they all really lived up to the dramatics with which he had shared them when she was a little girl. \"Incredible, Marshal Alden, you could write...ah...a whole epic about such a journey. You really fell all those titanous beasts? I knew of your esteem, but I figured the details had been embellished in passing...to hear them from you, it's quite amazing.\" She remarked, shaking her head softly, trying to dispel the disbelief she felt still lingering. Flann fought another little giggle as Juniper boldly exclaimed her father's following courtship with the girl he had aided in his quest, covering her mouth with her hand, trying to hide a gentle crimson hue which had crept across her cheeks. Flann joins the children in their cheers for Alden at the end of the tale, clapping her hands gently as he concluded the story. \"It's no wonder the heroes from Isra have stories which travel so far, Marshal Alden. I feel like with yer help..really, nothing could be impossible. Not even finding my da.\" she commented with a slender smile, meeting his eyes for only a moment. \"As fer yer story itself, it really does sound like a possible lead. I mean...my dad went missing in Isran waters without a trace, sounds like this Paradise place definitely could be an explanation fer his whereabouts, I'm hoping, anyway. I s'pose I head over that way here shortly, this...Chimera Commons. Ah..if I can get there by water some how, that is. God, please don't make me swim through the sewage again.\" she explains, the latter thought spoken more to herself than directed at Alden, her shoulders sagging, and shivering, at the thought.

I usually have Naoki watch them when needed.\" Alden likely being the only person in the world who could claim an Empress as their go-to babysitter. It was hard to say which stories were the origin of the tales her father had told her. He had only just started to rise to prominence around seven or eight years ago when Naoki went from Minister of Finance to Empress. Her rise taking him from one of her operatives to the head of The Sun Marshals, formalizing his role as her right hand in her new regime. \"I do not know much of the stories they tell.\" He admits with a shrug. \"But I do not embellish, I've tried in the past it turned out I was bad at it.\" Very bad, he had no sense for what other people found exciting since the things he did were simply work to him.When she laments possibly having to swim through sewage Alden rubs his chin. \"I am no enchanter myself, but if you like I could see about procuring you some sort of amulet that would let you bring water with you so you can walk on land. I do not know exactly how it all works but I am sure if I explain your situation something can be produced.\" Again we are met with the gap between the tose with power and those without. For Flann this would surely be a princely gift, for Alden who had no real concept for how money works and no practical limit to his funds.Alden's salary was suitable to his rank, however, his upbringing hadn't involved much opportunity to actually use money. Because of this, he allowed Naoki to handle his finances. She'd invested his salary and provided him an account so he could access what he needed for his day to day expenses, which weren't particularly high. Which meant he had a large fortune that was steadily growing and which he barely touched. To him, money was no object, in an almost literal sense.

She was still so used to being able to walk on land these sorts of massive barriers to day to day activities often slipped her mind, much to her own embarrassment. The frazzled fish girl was silent as Alden went on to explain his other sitters, mentioning Naoki as a frequent one, something which had her shuddering slightly once more with the thought, that she had just gotten herself involved with a family so privy to the empress as to consider her a nanny on the regular. The time he had spent talking fortunately gave her what she needed to calm herself from her earlier blunder, returning to a more neutral state. As Alden addressed her mention of his tales' far reach and her assumptions of their details fantastical in some way, a gentle smile tugged at the corners of her mouth, and another soft, shake of her head followed. \"I don't think ye need to embellish 'em one bit Marshal, they're plenty exciting on their own. I'd bet yer stories are more amazing told in truth than the embellished tales of lesser men. Truly.\" She remarked, searching and failing to recall other stories of a similar caliber to the one he had just shared from her youth. Her eyes went wide again as seemingly without a single second thought Alden offered her an expensive magical implement that might help alleviate some of her struggles being bound to the water. She waves frantic, dismissive hands his direction. \"I couldn't! I couldn't possibly ask ye to do this fer me as well, n-not today anyway! If it...happened to show up, with that information I am coming to pick up then..perhaps I'd find it hard to refuse. But not right now, you've done far too much as it is today ser.\" she contested.

She was baffled, not only at the generosity he would extend, but at how much it conflicted with her notions of nobility as greedy, uncaring, or cruel to those they lorded over.

He loves the children, he says nothing brings him greater joy than seeing a smile on their faces.\" The children perk up at this, apples were among their favorite treats especially candied apples. \"Because they have an abundance of them. I have been lucky enough to been graced with an abundance of wealth, power, and happiness. And much like the farmer, I find that these things are best used to bring a smile to people's faces.\"There is a pause and there are words unsaid in this though Flann would likely not know what they are, she did not know enough of his history. She would not know that he'd adopted this philosophy as a means of repentance for many crimes he had laid upon his shoulders. \"So I will accept your thanks but know that your happiness is enough payback for me.\" He gives her a smile and then turns to the children. \"Now, if you are still up to it I believe that you promised to help these little ones walk on water.\" The children erupt into cheers at this, having nearly forgotten the promise that had been made. However, before they can do something silly, such as hurling themselves at Flann their father speaks up. \"Go change into your swimming clothes children. I am sure you are going to get wet.\" The children not as one and they scamper off into the house to get changed. Alden watches them go with a smile before turning to Flann his expression growing cold and remote once more. \"Young lady, you seem like a kind and loving soul so please understand that I am only saying this because I am a man who believes in not hedging his bets.\" A pause as he meets her gaze and she would see the absolute sincerity in his eyes. \"I am placing quite a bit of trust in you, in letting you play with my children.

She understood where he was coming from, his position on her relationship with his kids, his caution. Flann gently bowed her head to him as he asked her to confirm her appreciation for his severity. \"Without question, Marshal. These are dangerous times, and evil wears many faces, that's what my old man used to say. I promise ye I have naught but the best intentions fer yer wee ones, and if that ever changed, I'd hope you'd see to it I was put down for such brutality.\" she said, wholly agreeing with his sentiment.
