It is the main place of magical study in Isra. The interior contains the library and archives of The Enclave, and various areas for magical research as well as the offices of the various masters of each branch of magic studied here. One should report here to the Provost to request becoming an apprentice of magic under a master. Disregard the anime girlsWithin the college is the main library of the Enclave, containing all books, scrolls, and documents relating to magic within Isra. The library is highly regulated, with only current apprentices and masters having unlimited access. Any outsiders must request access even to the main library. Not all of the magical tomes are kept here, however.\u00a0Beneath the roots of the college, lies a secret and secluded library. Only high ranking mages in the Enclave know of the library dubbed the forbidden archives, because this area contains all texts on more volatile forms of magic, such as necromancy, and demon summoning. The Archives are also located here containing records of every magic user in Isra.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/DFdFzK4.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/n0kRejB.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><u style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The College of Arcane Arts</u>\u00a0</div>"}}
