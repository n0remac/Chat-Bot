They have been used by the magical and unmagical alike, sometimes in tandem, other times in battle. It matters not as long as you're willing to pay for the gifts than you can receive here.Regina is often working to create more artifacts, so she leaves the selling to a halfling by the name of Aster.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/EpnwM0d.png"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><font face=\"times new roman\" size=\"5\"><b>The Artificiary</b></font></div>"}, "post-94932": {"user": "Fiona Blythe", "user_num": 3339, "timestamp": "1580099464000", "message": "With all the interesting artefacts and trinkets popping up all over the place, Fiona just had to find out where they were coming from.
