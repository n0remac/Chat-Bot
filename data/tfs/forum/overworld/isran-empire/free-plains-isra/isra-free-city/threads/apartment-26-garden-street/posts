They had to make it out of the Wyld first - which was fraught with danger, and she'd actually been injured, which had been both fascinating and terrifying all at once. Then they'd stopped in Gauldin to speak to Edward and Reuna, who had listened to the tale of what had happened after they'd been dropped off at the edge of the Wyld with obvious interest. And then it had been a trip by boat back to Isra, which Azure had enjoyed marginally less simply because she hadn't been able to swim with the dolphins this time.<br><br/>So it was that late in the evening nearly a full eleven weeks after she'd been restored to life, they finally returned to Temus' apartment. Azure set down her pack and crossed the floor to the window, looking out upon the city streets below. The cool glass against the tip of her nose, the dwindling sounds of the city's activity outside, the smell of the books in the room.. she still had to adjust. And that wasn't all she'd had to adjust to. She kept feeling these strange things when she was around Temus. Emotions she couldn't identify, and odd physical responses that she couldn't identify but which seemed to be tied to those feelings. It was confusing, and she pondered over this as she looked out on the city. Without turning around, she spoke quietly to Temus.<br/><br/><font color=\"blue\">\"Are you glad to be home?\"</font></br></font>"}, "post-44519": {"user": "Temus Grey", "user_num": 1148, "timestamp": "1468819798000", "message": "Temus had done better on the trip back than the trip to Gauldin.
