She still had a few of her prior creations tucked away with her working materials, back in her room at the inn, but it was a decidedly small collection. So after standing in the street for a few moments, silent and contemplative, she decided it would prove better in the long run for her to make some additional items, first. Get at least <i>some</i> stock ready, and then look into purchasing a vacant storefront.<br><br/>With this resolution in mind, she turned and made her way toward the bazaar. She had glimpsed it before, but hadn't actually ventured in to any degree. Now, she had a reason to! And her first stop was to purchase a bag with which to carry her soon-to-be-acquired materials. Stopping at a convenient stall, she located a sturdy bag of brown leather, and after exchanging gold for the item, slung it over her head. With the strap on her right shoulder and laying across her body, the currently-empty satchel was resting against her left hip, and it was in here that she tucked her bag of candies. Periodically stuffing one of the jellied orange slices into her mouth, she began roaming, looking for stalls selling pieces of wood, metal, and/or glass.<br/><br/>What she found instead made her stop, and blink in puzzlement. That was the other man from the candy shop, the younger one.. but what was he <i>doing</i>? Moon tilted her head, creeping closer to watch as the fellow tossed a few perfectly good apples in the air in an odd pattern. Her brow furrowed as she watched. Was this some sort of religious ritual?

He veered off in a different direction to Sariandi, instead moving to where the food was a little more savoury and cooked. He knew just what he fancied for his lunch and 'lo and behold, they had it!\"Elven bread!\" He almost gasped at the stall-owner, immediately pulling out some money and handing it over in return for a large piece. Elvolas, as he knew it from his childhood, was bread made by his ancient and now almost extinct peoples. It was savoury, yet had the slightest sweetness to it while the texture was a perfect balance between bread, biscuit and cake. As customary, it came wrapped in a beautiful green leaf of dark green from the starlight plant, which helped preserve and amplify flavour. It wasn't a popular food to outsiders. The unusual texture and the dash of sweetness mixed into the savoury made it a food that did not work well as part of a meal; it was something you ate on it's own and for that, most people grew bored of it. Yet when Ildesias was a commander, Elvolas was the food he gave his army - it was filling, packed with nutrition and a single large piece could last a warrior a week if he rationed it. As such the elven man was extremely happy with his purchase. He had never imagined to find it there, yet it was cooked in a perfect and traditional way! With a big beaming smile on his face, he wandered through the bazaar and ate while his eyes glossed over the amazing amount of stalls on offer. Yet it was not until he reached the quieter edge of the area that he found himself stopping... The stall was full of old scrolls, books and seemingly unidentified jewellery with a hint of magic to them. The old man who sat on the stall seemed bored, as though not many people even bothered to look at his useless collection of 'junk', much less buy from it. Yet Ildesias knew immediately that a treasure was on that stall.. And he couldn't help but move closer to investigate.

That it would be part of his destiny or something,\" the stallkeeper said, giving Ildesias a good look over. \"And now that I think about it, I recognize who you are, Lord Ildesias.\"Upon hearing his name be called, Ildesias shook himself awake and looked up towards the stallkeeper. \"I'm not Lord any more, just little more than a traveller. Can I see inside the box? It's locked.\"The old man chuckled again. \"I was going to try and sell it to someone as a cheap jewellery holder or something, but considering who you are I might as well admit that it's apparently worthless. Then when I consider who you are and what you've done for me and my family by founding this city, I'm going to let you have it for free,\" he explained as he dipped down behind his stall and came back up with a small, rusty key. He passed it over to Ildesias, who took it in one hand and prepared to push it into the lock but was stopped at the last second by the stallkeeper. \"Please don't open that here ser,\" he requested, giving a glance towards the woman who had been with Ildesias. \"I don't want any part in the destinies of any great men such as yerself, plus for all I know it'll explode or something and I'd rather not be taken with it.\"\"Hm, I see. Well thank you! I'll be sure to come back sometime and let you know what's in here,\" the elf replied with a smile.\"That'd do nicely,\" the old man replied. \"Oh, and be sure to tell your buddies to check out Oswald's Anomalous Oddities!\"Ildesias nodded, telling the man goodbye and then moving back over towards Sariandi. \"How curious,\" he told her as he examined around the lockbox and slipped the key into the hole. \"I wonder what's in here.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"I'm not sure yet.

And tell him to bring the First Eschille,\" he orders in a booming baritone, cutting through the chaotic cacophony, and the knight's helmeted head nods in understanding. The man takes off down the street, leaving only Ulfang and one of his honour guard remaining as Isran guardsmen swarm heedlessly around them to move toward the oncoming tide of afflicted.

When he locates the division's commander, he hefts his great sword onto his shoulder and strolls toward him.\"What is going on here?\" asks the King, calmly.

Wrath's leverage at this close-in range is limited, but Ulfang would rather keep the reach advantage than risk a glancing strike from someone as unnaturally strong as Wrath.As he's fighting with Wrath, thus holding his position, his own line is falling back. He risks getting cut off from his allies if he doesn't move back soon, and already the waves of blue bloods are beginning to turn on him. He lets out a growling yelp as one of the drug-crazed maniacs drives the center tine of a pitchfork powerfully forth between his cuisses and greaves, tearing through the chain and padded cloth that fill the gap and driving into the back of his knee, narrowly missing the politeal vein and severely damaging his collateral ligament before driving up into his femoral muscles. Ulfang slams the tip of Fang into the blue blood's face, felling him, and tears the embedded pitchfork from his flesh, causing blood to leak visibly down the black chain and stain the gambeson beneath. He hobbles back toward the line of guardsmen, slashing and hewing this way and that to fell Blue Bloods left and right until he slips past the first rank of his allies. He surely can't fight that monster with such an injury, and it'll take him a few moments of inaction to heal it, which he cannot afford.Ulfang steps to the back rank of the retreating guard and leans his blade up against an upturned stall. He raises his hands toward the main street, closing his eyes and inhaling deeply, centering himself as he draws up the magical power stored within. The palms of his hands begin to glow a sickly green, and he reaches out with his magic to the corpses of the guardsmen strewn all about the streets. He's surprised to find that he cannot establish a connection with the flesh of the Blue Bloods, but he pushes the thought aside. That's something to examine later, surely, but now he must work with what he has.The guardsmen begin twitching and spasming at first as their muscles are saturated with the power of souls of the sacrificed, and then they begin to rise, leaping upright with agility usually unseen in undead. They take up their swords and shields again, and continue the fight where they left off, working with mechanical coordination to draw together into a single square formation with shields facing outward, making it difficult for the drug-crazed maniacs to breach their defences as they tear a path of carnage through the Blue Blood ranks toward those of the Isran Guard. While the revenants are not as dexterous or agile as they were in life, those who take a hit that would otherwise be fatal for a living man fight on with little care for the damage, and it becomes quickly apparent that it'll take more than the basic converted common folk to take them down.This, Ulfang hopes, will draw the attention of Wrath and allow the rest of them to fall back to a more defensible position. He opens his eyes again, the faint green glow of Black Arts contamination fading from his irises as he takes up his blade again and holds it high to gain the attention of his comrades.\"Fall back!\" he bellows over the cacophony of blades clashing against blades. \"Live to fight another day, men of Isra!

That was contrary to his orders and as he tries to figure out just where this was all coming from he felt it, the pulse of magic spreading across the city. The new set had each been imparted with a special gift in order to make them excel at their role. Sloth's gift was tracking and he'd been looking for the source for a while, her pulse of magic painted a target on her back that he couldn't miss.Knocking an arrow it only takes him a moment to locate the sewer where Jun was still hiding. He didn't have a clean shot but that was fine, he'd selected his arrow according to the situation he expected. The shot was perfect thudding into the stone just above her.

His power was the most deadly of all The Set, in fact, his power was something that even Pride was a bit worried about. The magic that fueled the living enchantments that powered The Set was known as a Soul Trap. You see each member of the set shared the same unusual condition of birth, in that they had a massive capacity to store mana but no means by which to generate it. The rune pattern etched into their back though was made to overcome that limitation. Each kill trapped the soul of their opponent within them and powered the runes in their bodies it was a terrifying combination, the more they killed the more power they had at their disposal.Of course, most of the set could only express their power in a set way. The runes that enhanced them had limitations but Wrath's gift was the ability to turn magical power into strength and speed size without limitation. It was the same gift that the original Wrath, who was now Alden Marshal, had. The only difference was that the new Wrath could not store as much power as Alden, however, to make up for that he could also translate magical power into size.Blue energy begins to leak from the dark leather armour and dark steel of Wrath's equipment as he starts to grow. He was already towering at seven feet but he was soon eight, nine, ten feet tall and getting bigger by the moment as he charges Boscoe with his axe.

She remembered she promised to refer to Gluttony as Gorilla Hips. She remembered taking a spear to the crotch and being turned into a pin cushion by light tracking arrows. It was not a very fun day. She remembered traps and sand golems. How did the sand golems work? Something about the Blue Bloods reminded her of them...That's IT! A POWER SOURCE! THERE'S A POWER SOURCE IN THE EPICENTER! SEARCH THE BUILDING IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL THI-Her telepathic message to Boscoe, Vaelar, and Megan was interrupted by a stone clink just above Jun's head. Horror dawned in her heart, so deep that the emotion would probably leech into her final message. From having worked with Kaylie, she could sense what explosive arrows were like.... Fuck you Slo-(Static)A substantial chunk of Jun's ambient magic suddenly dissipated like dust in the wind. In particular, it was the birds who were possessed by holy flames that lost their powers and started to fly off in a panic.\u00a0But there were still a lot of animals and plants fighting back. Roaches, sparrows, dogs, vines, and bats continued to oppose the Blue Bloods and the two members of the Set. But no, the ambient spell had definitely lost some potency. What had happened? Was Jun still alive? Or did the spell simply have a lot of staying power regardless of what happened to the caster?", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/1615365/screenshots/3692800/apacolypse.jpg"], "html": "Jun desperately wished she could greet Vaelar, and only Vaelar through the maelstrom of activity.

It was a small scroll with an inscription on it.The massive crow, whose cataphract armor tore away from it with bloody feathers and entangled into the rubble, then collapsed. Its head splashed into a small stream of piss water and it lay there, prone. Its chest heaved rapidly and its bulging eyes glimmered in the sun.

Vaelar was anguished. Vaelar's blood was boiling. Jun's school of magic interpreted this as the sword of yin. Darkness was the defender of the self. It was not evil. In fact, Vaelar would need it now more than ever.Thick black vines coiled up from within the scroll. Yes, get angry. The city needs you to get angry. The vines darted up his arms like snakes, depositing a hot, red, vicious magic into him. Fight back. Fight with everything you've got. Tear the earth apart with your tears of anguish.

He'd feel his heart race and then steady, his senses sharpen, his strength increase, his muscles twitching like lightning.A harsh buzzing cascaded out from the sewer tunnel.

Their wing beats deafened.In addition to his strength and speed increases, Vaelar was now lord of the flies.

He holds his shield over him as the battering continues, but he knows it is hopeless. He stretches out a hand to grasp the scroll.Then, the rush of magical fury comes. His body quite suddenly feels stronger than it ever has, and his heart quickens with hot, unbridled rage. He pushes himself to his feet with a terrifying shout, flinging the blue bloods away with a sweep of his shield. He bangs his sword against his shield and dares them to come close and die with shouted jeers and taunts.

Then, a thought penetrates the haze and he turns his attention to the direction in which Jun's telepathic messages push him.He is barely conscious of why he sets off this way -- his heart tells him to stay and fight and kill all of these drug-afflicted men -- but he goes anyway, kicking and punching and slicing and battering his way through the crowd like the prow of a ship cutting through water. With Jun's magic, he has become unstoppable. A scythe gouges his left shoulder where the plate of his pauldron has been peeled back, but it is not a deep wound because of the chain underlay. The pain hardly registers, and he decapitates the perpetrator in a savage yet skillful stroke. He will make them pay for Jun, whatever it takes. He has to get to the epicenter.

They were a mindless relentless hoard power running through their veins as they fought harder, stronger, and faster than any mortal should have been able to. Already, the magic that was making them a match for the city guards was starting to burn them up. Enhanced strength, speed, and durability would take its toll regardless but for some, it was already too late. Bodies were hitting the streets, the magic having used up their life energy until every last ounce of it was gone. When that happened it was as though all the moisture in their body was sucked out at once as they become desiccated corpses. The effect was only hitting the older blue bloods at the moment. But soon the young would start dropping and from there the battle would be over. Something needed to change and it appeared as though it was about to with some intervention from beyond the grave. Megan's target was a medium-sized fountain, used for washing of hands or getting a free drink of water, built into the side of a little restaurant. The faint glow of the large rune that had been carved into the water at the bottom of the fountain was easy to miss in the light of day. The carving so intricate it was easy to think it had always been part of the water feature. Hidden in plain sight such arrogance but it had worked for quite a while.Of course, anyone versed with basic rune craft might have told Megan that crashing into it wasn't the best of ideas. Stopping rune magic was quite easy, if you defaced the runes in anyway then the magic would stop working. However, when you used this method you were also letting all the stored energy inside of the runes out all at once. For minor workings, this wasn't usually an issue but for a working that was effecting blocks of a city? The explosion was massive. Raw magical energy released as Megan cracked the stone of the fountain breaking the runic circuit at the bottom. The restaurant was reduced to rubble as was the building on the other side of the street. A magical shockwave cracking out like a roar of thunder knocking down anyone within a hundred feet. They were the lucky ones as those closer were shredded by the stone shrapnel. Megan's layers of ice might have provided some protection but would it be enough?Before the explosion even finished echoing through the streets the effects were seen. Blue Bloods drop to the ground as the physical toll they'd been putting their bodies through hits them all at once. Most fall unconscious, those that don't are too exhausted to move. Of course, this was a blessing since it was better than dealing immediately with the psychological trauma of realizing that you had killed friends, family, and innocent people in a rage you couldn't control.Wrath, who had been on the other side of the plaza when the explosion occurred looked over at the wreckage watching as the bodies fall to the ground. Some voice in the back of the monsters head told him that this was the point where he was supposed to flee.
