My mother was a Light Elf and a Shaman Healer. When I was 5 years old a band of orcs and goblins attacked my village, and I was forced to escape. My village was burned to the ground, and I don't even know if it exists anymore. The last thing I saw was my parents being stabbed by enemy swords.\"She paused for a moment, her voice pained by the memories and her eyes filled with mist.\"I ran through the forest the whole night, afraid that the enemy troops would catch me. But instead I was captured by evil men. They brought me to a dirty and cold house of stone where I was kept as their prisoner, together with a group of other children. Two men came into the room, demanding we called them our Masters. They forced me to become a thief, a pickpocket and a cat burglar. I tried to refuse, but they threatened to hurt the other children if I denied. So I had no choice but to obey. For 13 years I have been trained at scaling any wall, roof or ceiling, picking any lock or stealing any item no matter where it is placed. There was no room I could not enter through door or window. I was also trained to stay quiet and avoid detection. At the end of my training you can say I became quite Masterful. I never kept any of the stolen loot for myself. Everything I took went straight into the pocket of my Masters...\"She had kept her eyes lowered when she spoke of her past. This was a part of her story she was not proud of, and she wanted nothing more to do with her old life.\"I was also trained to use weapons if I one day should be forced to defend myself,\" she continued. \"My arrows fly as fast as the birds in the sky, and they hit almost anything they aim for. My dagger is fast and accurate, just as silent as its owner.\"Finally she was done telling of her shameful past, and she looked up at him again. Tears of shame were filling her eyes, as if she already expected him to toss her back out in the streets. \"I hated every moment of my life as a thief, Mylord,\" she said quietly. \"I have left my former Masters, and they didn't take it well.

There was something about him that made her trust him, and thus she had no second thoughts showing him her most treasured possession. Opening the worn leather bag she always carried with her, she retrieved an ancient book with a cover in brown leather. The book looked a bit worn, as if it had been read often. On the outside it looked just like any other book. But the inside was filled with ancient half forgotten Dark Elf spells and Light Elf runes of times long forgotten. \"This book belonged to my parents,\" she told him. \"I saved it when the enemy burned our house to the ground, before I had to flee our village.

It was much more than she had dared to hope for. A citizenship and a house to keep for life? That would mean no need to wander the streets anymore, scrounging through garbage to find her next meal. From now on she could buy what she needed and pay for it. \"I would be an idiot to turn down such a generous offer, Mylord,\" she said. \"The payment is way better than I had dared hoping for, and the house will come in handy as I don't have a home anymore. As I told you I ran away from my old Masters, and I don't think the village I was born in exists anymore. When I ran away I saw all the houses in there set on fire.\"She nodded when he mentioned where she would work, and for how long. The long hours didn't scare her, as she was used to working long hours in her previous job. The job seemed fair enough, and she was quite certain she could handle it. Her new boss seemed like a nice man, so she didn't mind spending long hours with him. It had been much, much worse if he had been a tyrant like her former Masters.\"I think the working conditions are fair, Mylord,\" she said after he had told her what was expected from her. \"I have worked long hours for as long as I can remember, so I am not afraid of hard work. I will be at your disposal whenever you need me. I am a very light sleeper and can also work nights if requested.\" She looked surprised at first when Ildesias said he found her trustworthy. It was not what she had expected to hear after telling him of her sinful past. Her face lit up in a smile and her eyes sparkled with joy. She silently promised herself that she wouldn't give him reasons to regret his trust in her. \"Thank you, Sir,\" she smiled and gave him a deep curtsy. \"I promise that I will not fail your trust in me.

When I first came to this city I was surprised by a thunderstorm and was forced to seek shelter in a tower I found. In the tower I met a nice dragon called Jakoopi. Perhaps you know him? He was very kind to me, and he offered me to stay in his tower. If I accept his offer I can stay with him and help out in his tower when I have time off from work. It is not far away from the Citadel, so I will have short way to work and will be available any time you need me.\"(OOC: Wild's living arrangements were arranged in the chatbox today with Jakoopi.

Seeing that Ildesias is currently occupied, and not being rude enough to interrupt, she stops a respectful distance away, and with a motion of her hand, brings her party to a stop behind her, deciding to spend her time waiting to gather her thoughts.Naoki hasn\u2019t yet met Ildesias. She had intended to introduce herself on her previous visit to The Citidel, but the crisis that brought her back to The Sun had prevented any such meeting. She had unknowingly stood beside Ildesias as he was doing his clandestine investigation of The Sun, and had even paused to examine the unique delicacy he was served, but Naoki had failed to recognize him at the time. And, though he may recognize her from that encounter, Demonlord Maelik had declined to notify her after the fact, so she was unaware of the event.She muses how to be best to introduce herself. There are a small handful of titles that would be applicable, but Naoki has always found it presumptuous when individuals, in introducing themselves, list all of their titles and skills. Just pick the most important one, maybe two, and leave it at that. At least as far as introductions go. Just the titles that are relevant to the business you intend to conduct with the other individual; nobody likes a show-off. But which one of hers would be best to use in this situation? Probably just \u2018Owner of The Midnight Sun\u2019. That carries enough connotations to imply most of the rest, she supposes. She assumes that with how major The Sun is at this point, Ildesias would have to be pretty blind to not have heard of it.

Midnight Sun associates, and people who owe The Sun a debt. To leverage such a community to vote for her would be exceptionally easy to do. However, those elections aren\u2019t held terribly often.

As Lumpy entered the citadel, any ideas about smashing and grabbing left. It would never work here.It was this notion that caused Lumpy some concern as he thought back to only a few moments before when Ershadt broke out the chocolates at the gates, and offered them to the guards. Ershadt never gave anyone anything. Least of all money, but chocolates so fine (if a little smushed) were a very close second, and certainly not to the bigfolk. Ershadt only \u2018gave\u2019 things away when he fully intended to have something much better for it later on, and chocolates immediately told Lumpy that Ershadt expected the score was going to be pretty damn sizable.

Lumpy had eaten things Quelci wouldn\u2019t put near her feet, much less in her mouth, and if they were back in the forest with these pies she\u2019d do very well to not end up with her hand licked clean of sugary fruit filling when the pies were gone.

If Lumpy wasn't immediately scared out of his rage at the sight of the inspector (which he was), he would have found a way to belittle the metal octopus for asking a question that he'd literally been screaming the answer to at the top of his lungs.\"Break out!\" he shouted to Qelci as he took off running along the wall that held the door she was headed for. At nearly a flat sprint, Lumpy's stolen princely cloak flapped behind him as he ran, his feet pounding against the stone floor of the Keep Hall.
