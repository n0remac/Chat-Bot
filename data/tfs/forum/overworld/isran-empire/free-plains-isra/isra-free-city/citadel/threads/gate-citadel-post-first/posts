Daemons too took to human form, in every form from sensual to innocent. Daemons could be horrifying, eldritch beings covered in eyes and shifting, non-euclidean bodies that flowed into themselves in geometrically impossible ways. The same was true of the angels, who often rivaled the daemons in their terror-eliciting appearance.

In his hand was an old-fashioned scrollcase fashioned of ebony wood, silver caps on either end. Upon one side of the tube the aforementioned Midnight Sun insignia was carved, the other sporting an eye cut with simple, strong curves. The messenger asked that it be delivered to Lord Ildesias, passing it over to the guards and continuing his rounds.When the case was opened, four sheets of paper were revealed. One was a detailed sketch of a man's face, the second a list of what looked to bits of speech, the third an exhaustive technical report on the impact a foreign magic seemed to have had, the last a lengthy, rolled strip that held a letter.        Dear Lord Ildesias,I am writing this letter on behalf of the Madame Treasurer, to report on the recent happenings in the Norkari Mountains. Though you were notified at some point during the action and arrived at the end, I am unaware as to how much you know. I will take it from the top.The Madame Treasurer and a few of her companions were traveling through the area when their ears were beset by an overpowering shriek, obviously from some distance away and loud enough to be worrisome. Two of her employees went to investigate the matter, finding a truly huge dragon, some four and a half kilometers in length. The dragon appeared to be made out of stone, being capable of manipulating it to some extent. It was also gifted with the capacity to utilize so-called \"light magic\", along with a strange, unknown sort of flame.When our eyes on the scene arrived, we found the paladin Ms. Arya Shieldheargrievously wounded. She seemed to have (rather foolishly) engaged the beast on her own, and paid the price for her actions.  Mr. Maelik distracted the dragon while Ms. Lum'Valia took it upon herself to heal the aforementioned paladin. Mr. Maelik and the beast battled before a while before the dragon became sidetracked, going to chase the carriage that the Madame Treasurer was traveling in. It seems that it was interested in a child within this carriage, on which I will elaborate below.Several employees of the Black Tower showed up and joined the fight, while Mr. Maelik continued to disrupt the beast's efforts to reach the child. Ms. Lum'Valia took the time they bought to unleash a spell that all but destroyed the creature. Her blast revealed that the dragon's size was inflated by a sort of artificial shell, seemingly composed of the stone it was capable of manipulating. After that layer had been stripped away, the \"core\" of the beast, as it were, was a mere two or three meters long.Seemingly unrelated to the fight, another being of a draconic nature showed up after the hostilities were finished, seeming to spread life and foliage across the previously barren and shattered rock. The identity of this dragon is currently being investigated.I am communicating to you not only to speak of the specifics of the fight, but to share a few very interesting tidbits that the dragon saw fit to roar in the midst of the it. Most importantly, it called itself \"Rag'Novok the Shattered\", if the name is in any way familiar to you. If one were to listen to the beast, its age would be measured in millennium, and he insisted that he had walked both this plane and others in its time. In particular, he claimed that the Norkari mountains and the area around were once under his control, and he intended to douse them in fire to reestablish his rule.On to the child I mentioned earlier. A very young Orc was recently found on the streets of Isra and taken in by the Midnight Sun. This dragon seemed to sense the child within the carriage, oddly enough, referring to \u201cthe Orc child\u201d as \"Mathladeem\". He was angry enough to immediately break of the fight to pursue this child, seeming to believe that this little fellow had somehow \"humiliated\" him in the past. He gave no more information about this.At the very end of the fight, an extremely powerful stranger showed up. He hadn't much time to participate in the battle, but the dragon seemed to recognize him, calling him \"Syros\" and claiming that he had killed some of his \"wrymlings\" far in the past. This man wandered off after the fight without introducing himself or explaining the purpose for his timely arrival. Though the eyes on the field did not get a spectacular view of his face, I have included a sketch as accurate as I am able piece together.The last thing to mention was that this dragon, in response to Syros' appearance, labeled himself as the first of the \"Titans Reborn\". Though this could have been mere bravado, the potential that other beings as hostile and powerful as him exist or could awaken are troubling, to say the least. Included is a full list of the dragon\u2019s speech, to safeguard against  the possibility that I haven\u2019t seen something that you might, as well as a reasonable analysis of the effect the dragon\u2019s aura had on the surrounding terrain.I will continue to look into the matter of the dragons, his words, the Orcish child, and the stranger. If I should uncover any additional information, I will get in touch once more.Best of fortune,        Reese Cresno", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Late in the day of the dragon attack, a young messenger with the symbol of the a Midnight Sun pinned prominently upon the lapel of his jacket jogged up to the Citadel.

As the other children, Alden, and Thaelyn all approach and offer their gratitude, Naoki nods in response, and responds, \u201cWell, you\u2019re all very welcome- it\u2019s my pleasure, but I also haven\u2019t started yet.\u201d Offering a slight shrug, she adds, \u201cI request that all thank-you-hugs be saved for after the tour.\u201d\u201cHowever!\u201d Raising a single finger to point into the air, Naoki waits until she has everyone\u2019s attention before continuing, \u201cBefore we can begin, there are a few things that must be understood. First and foremost, this is The Citadel. Inside, government workers, politicians, and soldiers are all working, and the majority of their work is absolutely essential to the continued well-being of the state- very important! As such, our tour cannot disturb them, so you should all conduct yourselves carefully and respectfully.\u201d\u201cFurthermore, this is The Citadel. It\u2019s one of the biggest buildings in the world, and it\u2019s very easy to get lost inside, especially in the underground portions. I\u2019ll admit, I myself have lost my way inside before, on a few occasions. As such, you should stay very close to an adult at all times. Either your father, Ms. Thaelyn or myself. If you do get lost, you should, first of all, stop moving. If you wander too far, it will take longer to find you. Secondly, if you see someone who works here, you should- if you would feel comfortable doing so, approach them, state that you are a guest of Lady Naoki\u2019s, and request their assistance in finding your way back to the group.\u201dHonestly, between Alden and the possible assistance of Takhana, Naoki doesn\u2019t expect to have any issues with lost children but figures it prudent to give the advice anyway, on the off chance that it ends up being relevant at some point. Not to mention, simply giving the advice makes getting lost seem like a legitimate possibility, and serves to reinforce the suggestion that they stay close, which makes things that much easier.\u201cWith all of that in mind, let\u2019s start the tour right here.\u201d Pointing downward with two fingers to indicate the very ground beneath their feet, Naoki launches directly into it. \u201cThis is, as you might be able to guess, the gate of The Citadel.\u201d With a grand sweeping motion, she gestures to the structure of the gate towering above and around them. Each of the great doors is easily twenty meters tall, and though the doors stand agape, the whole thing lends itself easily to a feeling of silent, imposing strength.\u201cBack behind you,\u201d she continues, gesturing, \u201cthose steps you came up are very important. First of all- and most importantly, they keep my legs in shape, because I have to climb them each day to get to work. \u2026 Beyond that, they\u2019re also an important defensive measure. If anyone troublesome wanted to get into The Citadel, they would have to climb these stairs, which leaves them at the mercy of any archers up along the walls, up there.\u201d Pointing, Naoki indicates the crenelations high above, which are all but filled by soldiers, each maintaining a vigilant watch. Drawing the group\u2019s attention back downward, Naoki now indicates the Citadel Guards, standing at rapt attention to either side. While usually, they would only number perhaps twenty or so, today there must be at least double that, inside, outside, and around the gate. Some watch the group, others stare off down the steps, one fellow seems to be wrestling with deep-seated anxiety, and one guard even has the audacity to pick at her nose.\u201cThese fine men and women are members of The Citadel Guard, a special portion of Isra\u2019s military tasked with the important job of protecting The Citadel and ensuring the safety of those within. Specifically, these individuals are tasked with operating the gate, and making sure that only people who are supposed to can go through. And, as it so happens, we\u2019re loitering in the gate. So let\u2019s proceed inside- follow me.\u201dBeckoning, Naoki proceeds, intentionally moving more slowly than she might usually in consideration for little legs, and leaving her hands idle at her sides.

They sat in a circle around what would become the base of this hill, and wove \u2018A spell that will move stone and lumber and craft them together as though only the finest craftsmen and builders were working.\u2019\u201dNaoki\u2019s impersonation of Ildesias is, of course, on point, but still, she continues, \u201cIt was the first spell of its kind attempted on such a scale. Because it\u2019s one thing to build, a house, or a shed, or whatever, but it\u2019s entirely another to build something like this.\u201d As they step out into the courtyard, Naoki gestures around them. To every side, the towering architecture rises up around them. Though it has lost the majority of the novelty for Naoki, one can\u2019t deny that it\u2019s a damn impressive building, what with its spires, gates, fortifications, and purely ornamental statues. \u201cOver the course of a full day and night, Ildesias and the conjunction channeled immense amounts of mana into the spell, first raising this hill out of the land, and then utilizing stockpiled materials to build the structure you see today. As I hear, it was an amazing spectacle, to watch all of the  stones and bricks and such fly through the air and assemble themselves into the structure you see today. And if you\u2019ve ever seen a more mundane construction mage at work, you can sort of get a sense of what it must have been like\u2026 but still. I regret not being there to see it in person...\u201d\u201cAnd, to be fair, in the years since then, we haven\u2019t had to do much to change it. A few modernizations, regular maintenance, and repair, but otherwise The Citadel has been serving our needs well. We\u2019re only just now, with the increased size of the government, beginning to utilize the full extent of its facilities.\u201dWith this stated, Naoki opts to leave it at that for the moment, pausing off to one side of The Keep Hall\u2019s entrance to allow the group to look around and acquaint themselves with what\u2019s visible from the courtyard. All around them, individuals shuffle from place to place, in and out of the Keep Hall, toward The Enclave tower, and among the other various buildings and facilities. This flurry of activity is, of course, in preparation for the upcoming conflict, but Naoki doesn\u2019t feel the need to mention that to the children right now.", "link_list": ["/user/193"], "image_list": [], "html": "\u201cMhm.

You see, all this,\" Zemp waves a carefree hand around at the floor, ceiling, and surrounding soldiers, \"All this civilization and culture, some may think that you get quite a lot out of having a whopping big city and centralized government. When you have all this, though, you get used to things all conforming to the rules and regulations put in place to protect the ways things are. I cannot just waltz out of the gates and go for a walk. I have to have paperwork and forms.\"The tea is cleared away after Zemp nods towards the few guards hovering nearby. He smiles at Nit in an apologetic way as he shrugs. \"My highers up assumed you would be our primary contact for negotiations. Now that we have our relations clear, permit me to gather a few of my compatriots, and we can go meet your 'Legion Master'. Please, come with me. I will make sure that you are justly compensated for your time, sir.\"The small contingent of guards, having turned out the small room, rise to leave the room. Zemp insures that Nit is with him, close by, as they prepare to leave the guardhouse and return to the main gate. \"You and I, sir, will make our ways to the forward gate stables. I have a message off to be superiors requesting leave to go with you and meet your 'boss' for negotiations. As soon as I have permission to depart, I trust you will be willing to ride ahead and tell the Legion Master that I am willing to meet with them on neutral ground for negotiations?\"The elderly gentleman feels sorry for Nit. It is clear the poor fellow is completely out of his depth. Obviously, he wanted to get his gold and get on with his career, such as it was. There were a few ways of dealing with lackeys such as this, but Zemp never went in for verbally lashings underlings. Far more beneficial to treat them with the utmost civility. Even better was to expose them to the full weight and force of the most deadly force imaginable: bureaucracy.

He extends his thumb and forefinger, spinning the wrist about twice before nodding. The signal has the effect of slowing down the encircling guards, leaving five flanking on the left, and another five on the right. Gravel crunches underfoot as the small group maneuvers through the Citadel proper, and into the military grounds beyond. The path before the two negotiators is clear until the door of the guardhouse, where two soldiers arms with halberds stand watch. <br><br/>As the sun mounts higher into the sky, the city begins to fully awaken on all sides. The crescendo of cosmopolitan business cuts through the dawn. A backwards glance from Zemp towards his charge causes the older fellow to slow his pace to walk alongside the figure. They reach the guardhouse as one of the soldiers snaps off a salute before opening the door. Zemp enters, smartly touching two fingers to the brim of his cap. <br/><br/>Inside the guardhouse, the representatives of the negations make their way to the dining quarters, which have been converted into an impromptu conference room. One smaller circular table sits in the middle of the room, with two chairs sitting across from each other. <br/><br/>Once seated, Zemp begins.<br/><br/>\"I welcome you to our fine city. Would you care for a cup of tea, good sir?\" <br/><br/>Zemp nods towards an orderly, who brings forth a steaming pot resting on a large tray. Two enormous mugs, easily rivaling the pints served at the closest tavern, find their way near the elbows of Nit and Zemp. It is clear the offer of tea was a nicety, and that the beverage would be served regardless of response. <br/><br/>\"Diplomatic regulations require tea be served at all such functions. That is no reason to skimp on the quality however. Nor do the old rule books say we can't liven the tea up a bit, eh?\"<br/><br/>Zemp produces a small flask from somewhere in his coat, and pours a slosh of its contents into his mug, topping off the beverage expertly. <br/><br/>\"A charge of spirits, should you desire. A finely distilled sugarcane and molasses concoction. I find it to a powerful addition to the oil of bergamot found in this particular blend of tea.\" <br/><br/>He slides the metal flask over to Nit with a wink. The elderly man clears his throat.<br/><br/>\"I'm quite prepared to hear your terms, good sir, for the safe return of our mutual friend currently being held hostage by your compatriots. What would you require for her safe and unmolested conduct back to us?\"<br/><br/>[@huntinglegion ]<div class=\"quote_clear\"></div></br></div></div>Nit notes Zemp using some sort of signalling to his comrades as he was following him, but he is unable to tell what they mean or what they are for, either way Nit doesn\u2019t trust it as they travelled down the path. Nit follows his guide into the guardhouse, where he is met with a table and two chairs.<br/><br/>Nit stood for a moment as Zemp was brought tea. What kind of meeting was this? It as like they were scared of the mighty Nit! Or just wanted to be his friend. After a short moment of pause for Nit to process what was going on, he awkwardly takes his seat across from Mr. Zemp, clearly not accustomed to proper \u201cchairs.\u201d He then reaches for his assigned cup of tea, not wanting to refuse free drinks! But what if it was poisoned? Despite his suspicions of the warm liquid, he accepts it anyways. He was smart enough however, to refuse the \u201cspike\u201d he was being offered.<br/><font face=\"comic sans ms\">\u201cI\u2019ll try yur tea\u2026But no extra stuff please.\u201d</font><br/><br/>Nit begins to drink the tea best he can by weirdly fitting the majority of the mug in his mouth and pouring it down his throat. Joseph begins to then turn the topic back to why he was here, as he stopped chugging his drink. The Legion had a prisoner of theirs.<br/><font face=\"comic sans ms\">\u201cWell\u2026\u201d</font> Nit didn\u2019t know if now was the best time to explain he didn\u2019t exactly know what they wanted, <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-710 group-0\" href=\"/user/710\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@kiggy\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Legion Master Zhax</span></a></span>  wanted Nit to go fetch someone to make negotiations with him, not Nit.<br/><font face=\"comic sans ms\">\u201cNow, I dunno specifically what da boss <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-710 group-0\" href=\"/user/710\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@kiggy\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Legion Master Zhax</span></a></span>  wanted, cause I think he wanted to talk with you, he didn\u2019t tell me much, but I know that we were definitely gunna want some of dat gold you guys got.

Zemp is content to slowly pack his long piper and smoke while Nit becomes more and more distraught with how long things are taking to progress. This agitation is the only thing keeping Zemp from falling into similar distress.Finally, a haggard looking man sprints up to the stable master and presents her with a signed, sealed, and stamped document approving the usage of \"twenty-five (25) horses and one (1) cart for travel purposes diplomatic in nature\". There is a brief moment of panic when the stable-master tuts over the location of the signature on the third page. Someone in the foreign service signed slightly under, and not directly on, the line. This proves inconsequential after a hearty procedural debate.\u00a0 \"A reminder, sir\" Zemp says to Nit, \"We are to meet on neutral ground. I will await your signal when we arrive within a quarter kilometer of the position.\"With Nit ready to depart, Zemp holds back with his collection of soldiers to go over their plan one final time.\"Remember, we are playing this largely by ear. We are not entirely sure what to expect, so I do ask that we have calm and order and all times. As a friendly reminder, you are not permitted to use force of any sorts unless the express order is given. We all know the rendezvous point should things go against our favor.\"Zemp taps his pipe out and returns it to a small pouch on his saddle bag. Two stable workers help him mount his horse, and the company moves to ride out.

Then comes an individual that strikes the boy as odd in both movement and attire. Instead of the armor, uniform, or robes of most, this person wears all black, with a cloak that covers their face and pools at their feet. And instead of walking as anyone might, this person\u2014whoever they are, seems\u2026 stiff. Their limbs seem to have a full range of movement, so they lurch along, each step just the same as the last.

The boy, seated on his barrel, has nowhere to go, so he shies away, equal parts awkward and terrified. The figure, with Things to Attend To, moves along, but not before the boy spies something shimmering gold pinned to the cloak. Though he couldn\u2019t read the wording, the size, shape, and presence of inlaid rubies make it recognizable to the boy as a Sun Marshal badge.

On the other, that was one scary whoreson, and Sun Marshals are hardly shining paragons of virtue like Dawn Riders. The Sun Marshals do things no one hears about, the \u201cdirty work,\u201d and with that in mind, they are afforded the appropriate amount of respect.More importantly, however, thinking about The Empress and her gloriousnesses reminds the page of his job, of the scroll in his pocket, which is of utmost importance.

The page hasn\u2019t seen Mr. Fletcher and the taskmaster neglected to give him any clues, but the boy figures that only one pair of that description, with their uncommon hair colors and \u201creal nice knockers\u201d ought to come through The Citadel Gate tonight. If they come separately, the boy is worried that he won\u2019t recognize Mr. Fletcher. There's an awful damn lot of those Fletchers and this one doesn\u2019t even work in The Citadel.

The unlucky few outside internally curse their luck for having been assigned this miserable day to remain out in the elements.One large canvas tarpaulin stretches down from one side of the post down to the ground where it is fastened with several stakes. From underneath, a handful of guards play a languid game of dice at a table. Two other guards stand further away, each taking shelter under the small overhang extending out from the wall.

Both guards take notice of their visitor and return smart salutes.The one on the left speaks.\u201cAfternoon, young sir.\u201dWater splatters down, sending splashes of mud every which way as the rain begins to intensify. A low rumble rolls over the assembled individuals, causing more than a few to look out to the horizon. Dark clouds churn.

The leftmost guard lowers his head slightly as a fat drop of water falls directly onto his forehead.

Another hopeful suitor for the Empress, it seemed.Keph\u2019s information is recorded onto parchment and taken in to the longhouse. Off in one corner sits a brand new machine recently put together by the Isran Blacksmith Guild. The machine produces passes for all foreigners and visitors to the Citadel, giving them a temporary leave to go about the Citadel according to their purposes. Guards throughout the Citadel might request passes before allowing visitors into certain areas, or to check their purpose of visit to best help give directions. Violating the duration of one\u2019s stay was a serious offense, as was operating outside the defined purpose of visit given.The machine looked like someone had smashed a printing press and metal press into one upright device.  One guard assembled a collection of small, thumb sized metal stamps and inserted them into a large bar resting over top a metal plate. Each stamp clicked in with the satisfying snick of metal on metal. A tablet of steel, roughly the length and width of a oak leaf, rests on a mat directly beneath the metal press arm. Down comes the arm, resting atop the tablet beneath. Another guard comes over to help the first twist a lever sticking out from the press from left to right. The arm clamps down onto the metal tablet, impressing the young boy\u2019s name and purpose of visit into the surface. After several moments, the guards pull back on the lever and remove the tablet. Along with the paper records, the tablet comes back outside. Raindrops splatter the surface of the metal, pooling in the recesses formed by the press.Rodrick clasps the object between his hands and whispers a quick incantation. The water sizzles as the drops burn away from the heat. After a few seconds, the guard blows on the surface of the metal, cooling it down.\u201cHere you are, young sir, this is your safe pass to the Citadel. I\u2019ve enchanted it so that someone will always be able to scry your location whilst you remain here with us. Once you leave through any of the gates, the enchantment will break. You can hold on to your pass as a keepsake after that, if you like. Unless you win this contest the Empress has devised and remain with us longer!\u201dThe tanned, rough face breaks into a lopsided smile as the rain beats down as remorselessly as before. Drops cling to his short beard and eyelashes, forcing him to blink several times. After a beat, the guard holds the metal pass out to Keph.\u201cDo not go anywhere in the Citadel without this pass, understood?\u201dThe metal is warm to the touch. The impression reads out in crisp letters:Name: KephPurpose of Visit: Social/By InvitationPass Valid For: 5 days\u201cNow, I will take you into the lodge, sir. From there, we will have you set up with your accommodations for your stay. Welcome to the Citadel!\u201dThe guard motions for the two men on either side of the gate to open the wooden barrier before indicating that Keph should follow him closely.

The young lad pulled his hood over his head and grinned at the guards who\u00a0had returned his salute - they definitely performed it in a far nicer manner than he did.\u00a0<br><br/>As per usual, Keph dug into his bag to grab his notebook. The writing would be less neat than his usual writing, as the droplets that were gradually ruining the paper put him in quite the hurry to get his message out. Once done, he protected the notebook with his cloak and turned the message to the guard, which read (in bad, but still readable handwriting and a few blots of water and ink): <b style='font-family:\"'>\"Keph heard something related to the Empress receiving visitors from around Isra and he'd like to take part.

Granted, his only reason was clearly only\u00a0curiosity! Of course, he avoided explaining this to the guard, partially from embarrassment and also due to just wanting to get out of the rain soon.<br/></font><div class=\"quote_clear\"></div></br></div></div>"}, "post-84250": {"user": "The Isran Empire", "user_num": 1310, "timestamp": "1533059963000", "message": "Rodrick nodded and passed the completed forms for each of the gnomes off to another guard.

On the one hand, you had your standard tabby cats, your tom cats, the earthy cats of the street, as it were.  Then there exists The High Lady, Her Eminence. Rodrick remembers seeing Empress Naoki exactly once. There had been a parade on a splendidly sunny day. The procession snaked its way around the entirety of Isra, beginning and ending at the Citadel itself. No one had ever enjoyed sitting in the warmth of the sun as much as the Empress. The way she had moved, and the ears, a decidedly feline mind in the body of a human.But this: the mind of a cat in the body of a cat that spoke with the voice of a man. Not the worst thing to come calling, but just odd enough to give the man pause.

Her ankle cuffs seemed to poof out like a cone, drifting behind her, as she stood upon prussian blue platform shoes, with elaborate designs of silvery stars and moons dancing across.

When Alured had initially entered Isra, he had found its people a far cry from what he had been expecting. There was very little for he or his people to do here and while the Church of Varafel's popularity was increasing, it was slowly. Although certain steps had been taken to solidify a foothold here, it was simply too little. His elven heritage, coupled with magic given to him by the divine, meant that there was very little doubt in mind he would live long enough to see his plans come to fruition. That meant waiting centuries, perhaps longer, however, and while he may survive, there was no guarantee he would continue to keep the momentum of support alive. Human's lives were short, after all, with memories even shorter. That meant, unfortunately, that drastic steps must be taken. With total support from the throne, it would mean his goals could be met in a matter of decades. Those who followed him now, they may very well live to see the entry of a new era. Support of that level, however, only came with one of two stipulations: Either the Lady Naoki was a worshiper of Varafel (a fact he very much doubted could be achieved.) Or the simple idea that he was Lord of Isra. The Lady of Isra was playing with the idea of selecting an heir. It was an admittedly uneasy decision. However, despite everything, perhaps he could be suitable. Or, at least, seem to be suitable for a few centuries or so. The question is, how could he possibly convince her he was superior to her other suitors? He could use cold facts. Naoki had seemed down-to-earth. Calculating. Perhaps the iron truth that he was better than the competition would be enough to sway her. Or should he...woo her? He slowed to a stop, then, polished court shoes clocking on the cobblestone path as he considered it. Did he...even remember how to woo someone? How long had it been? The last time he had truly been with someone...he was a different person then. A different existence that what he was now. Shaking the thoughts away he smoothed out his court doublet (a modest affair several centuries out of style) and reached up to adjust his mask...only for his gloved fingers to touch his bare cheek. She likely wouldn't recognize him. The only thing that he bore that resembled his usual self, was the holy symbol on a chain around his neck and an aura of grim agelessness.
