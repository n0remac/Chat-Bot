From the fort on the Plateau, all outpost towers could be seen if a fire was lit or heard if a horn was blown. If I can remember right, there was travelers speaking of a poisonous desert on your northern borders. I presume that since Sinn came from this direction, The Phoenix State is north of here.

Thank you for standing by the word 'Free'.I believe outposts and joint force will be good for your land, regardless of what does or doesn't happen. It is a wise decision. Your walls will be crafted years from now, when as you said, it become a jewel. Not only will the outposts and fort help your land, but in turn would seem to benefit The Phoenix State, acting as an alarm if anyone came near yours. So if the supplies are there, let us supply your block and steel, since I noticed some it near the supply yards in the area dropped by The Phoenix State. And with regards to feeling as though you were being bought, if I was in your place, I would feel the same. There was nobody but myself and my people when I built my empire, and there is no better feeling for a nation when they do it themselves. So how about we reduce manpower, and simply drop steel and stone. In return, since I believe it is a desert, we will take wood. Instead of giving, let's just open a trade. Stone and steel for wood. We'll just give you a good deal on the supplies. So for every load dropped, we will take one load of wood. You've got the forestry, and you can broaden your plains. Does that make you feel better about it? To make it better, we'll supply manpower if you will feed them and shelter them. Then, when the main work is done here, we'll pay your people to come work for us. This would help people of either land could work here or there. This would make us completely open to each other, fueling your economy and ours, while ensuring our people can always find work. All these motions would eliminate any donations, taking the dependency off the table. All would be done through trade.

Many people left the tribe to parts unknown, and many more were killed, before finally a group of champions of our tribe rose up to restore balance and eliminate the threat.\"As a result, there was a major reformation in our people's views. We became more understanding of each other as human beings and we did our best to establish a harmonious society between our clans. We also performed a great deal of research in non-magical farming methods which helped maintain the balance of power among those with and without magic. There are still many mages who specialize in agriculture, but also many more who now specialize in other arts, such as combat.\"So, if we agree to become allies, we would be happy to share some of our agricultural methods as well as our knowledge of offensive magic, in the interest of benefiting both the Phoenix State and the Free City.\"A'Shen interrupted. \"Do you mind if I add something?\" After receiving the go-ahead from Yumi, he turned towards Zaltos and Ildesias. \"Our proposition would also help address a flaw which you might not have noticed in your current plan. You see, increasing your skills in magic and agriculture would help expand the economies of both parties and allow your people to trade more actively, because, and I say this with the utmost respect, your current plan is unsustainable. Eventually the forests will run out and the fortifications will be built, walls or no walls. After that there may not be as much incentive for your people to work together, and that is when the temptation for the Phoenix State to start taxing and establish a military presence in the Free City will begin.\"He turned towards Zaltos. \"I'm not suggesting that's what the Phoenix State desires, but surely there will be people in your government who will feel that the Free City 'owes' them. However, if both of you grow alongside each other and get used to trading with each other as equals, I believe that outcome is much less likely. We may be able to help with that.\"Jani decided to add one more thing. \"I'm sorry, I'm not as articulate as my friends back there. But I wanna say something too. I think... it's important for you guys to not just exchange economically, but culturally as well. In our tribe, members of different clans will go to each other to learn different... disciplines and form bonds. I think... both of you have a lot of people. 1.7 million and 700,000. Zaltos, the Free City is probably the single largest, um... entity, you've ever had to deal with. Don't you think there's a great deal you guys can learn from each other? Why not send each other's citizens, go to each other's schools, attend each other's festivals and holidays, really get to know each other's cultures?\"Finally, Hanso spoke. \"Heh, I'm afraid I'm the least... ARTICULATE, of all, but I get the gist of what she's saying. You two shouldn't become just allies. You should become true friends. Party together, fight together, INTERMARRY!\" He looked at Andraste and winked. Jani smiled and slapped him on the shoulder. \"Don't be rude.

It's just a matter of moving them to their designated towers, and ordering the construction of enough scorpions to line the top of the walls in addition to archers. I will also pass a letter to the city armoury and find whether we can find oil to defend the gates. Magic is a far more valuable resource than oil, and while we can set magical traps, we frankly do not have enough trained mages to rely on them. Oil, or any other sort of highly flammable sludge, is probably a far better alternative. Not to mention that burning oil has more of a psychological affect than it has physical. Soldiers will not willingly stand close to our walls once they are aware of what we have to defend it.

It wasn't the neatest writing, but he was filling the pages with information. \"I am going to make my own suggestion. There will be a total of twenty-four fortified towers surrounding the city, thus separating the walls into twenty-four equal segments of wall and acting as both storage for equipment and sleeping areas for soldiers. As of now, there are no further plans for the towers, for my suggestion is expensive enough that I thought I would seek the approval of the assembly before allocating funds: trebuchet's. Large and powerful enough that they are only used in extended sieges where there is enough time to build them on site according to the specifications of highly trained engineers. We, in defending our city, have the opportunity to place them upon our towers to meet any foe. A design draft has been submitted by one of the wall architects, depicting a trebuchet made of metal and steel. Larger and more powerful than standard trebuchets, it is capable of firing multiple ammunition types over extremely long distances and decimating foes far from our walls. The engineer expects the effective range to be almost 900-1,000 meters, whereas traditional trebuchets that are carried and built on site by attacking forces have a range of only 300.\"Ildesias could not help but smile at the images he had in his head. \"But there is more. The metal of the trebuchets, their equal spacing from each other and their height allow for the projection of a defensive dome across the skies of the city. If trained mages were to channel their magic into these conduits, together it would form a protective layer of magic to protect the city from attacks from the air. However, the dome would not cover the walls or the towers, and the mages would be rendered immobile. And if one these trebuchets were to be destroyed, it would open a hole in the protective dome that an enemy could easily exploit.\"He closed his book. \"Think on this idea.

I am Madame Naoki, Treasurer. I have additional information to share, regarding the effect this has on our economy, the closure of their borders and some information I received from another source.\u201d\u201cThe Medanese borders were closed last week, and all approaching visitors and trade caravans have been denied entry. From what I've been able to gather, they're denying entry to every single individual who approaches, including our traders, merchants, travelers, and also that of other nations, and independent parties. This is going to have a fairly major impact on the Isranian economy in that we used to import and export a lot to Medan on a very regular basis, and now all of that has stopped. I'm not sure yet, of the full impact this will have, but let it suffice to say that this is definitely detrimental to us, and there may be some shortages of certain commodities in the next few weeks. I'm going to do everything I can to dampen the impact and maintain the stability of the economy, but we've just lost one of our major trade partners, and there's a limit as to what I'm going to be able to do. The most major countermeasure that I think is worth mentioning now is that I intend to open trade routes with The Kingdom of Gauldin, and I believe in doing so, we can compensate in some capacity for the loss of Medanese goods.\"\"Additionally, they\u2019re building walls. Large, stone walls around their borders, and are manning them with soldiers. This information was provided to be by a trustworthy source of mine who is currently loitering a short ways away from the border. This is a massive step up from the previous border security of Medan, and I believe it is safe to assume that they are also arming themselves. I have agents passively observing from afar, but none within the borders themselves.\u201d\u201cAdditionally, I was approached last night by one of my acquaintances. Though I cannot vouch directly for the accuracy of this information, he told me that, according to one of his companions who is gifted in an esoteric form of srying magic, that there is \u2018great suffering\u2019 currently occurring within the borders of what we once knew as Medan, implying mass torture. Greater investigation will obviously be required before we go accusing anyone of anything, but my contact was very distressed, and attempted to convince me to take independent action against Goraria- which I have not. I have, so far, only dispatched scouts to observe the border from afar, and relate back any information they can gather from a kilometer away- information I will be swift in sharing with you all, as soon as I receive it. I have brought my contact, he who knows firsthand of the scrying magic, here with me today. He is @hyydra , a shaman of the orc tribe of Falkreath.

Not only does whatever power is at play over there have the ability to kill an entire city and reanimate the corpses as undead in the space of a mere twenty four hours, they also have the ability to raise other undead from above, through some magical mechanism that appears as rain. Impressive. Terrifying, but impressive. Seems like someone pissed off the wrong necromancer. After allowing all assembled to assess the reports in combination and form their own conclusions, Madame Naoki speaks again, addressing the room at large. \u201cThe situation in Aaedan is, I don\u2019t think anyone will challenge me when I say this, definitely a potential threat, and we should consider it as such. With that in mind, all that remains is deciding how to best address it, if at all. I would first motion that The Enclave of Isranian Magi   begin taking city-wide defensive measures to ensure that a similar magic cannot sweep through Isra in a similar manner. And that patrols and gate guardsmen take extra caution and keep their eyes open for undead, and those who show evidence or proficiency in necromancy. With a potential enemy as powerful as all this, we should not underestimate their ability, and should be cautious not to allow their agents to enter our city.\u201d\u201cHowever, the matter that is not quite so easy to agree upon may be who to send. \u2026 This man,\u201d she gestures to the rider, \u201cwould like to see us mobilize the army to quench the undead currently terrorizing their lands. Doing that would obviously mean sending our soldiers all the way across The Expanse into the core of this necromatic tragedy. Many of them might not return. But they would be the lucky ones.\u201dShe pauses for a morbid moment, casting her singular uncovered eye around the table, allowing her implication of fallen soldiers returning to Isra as a component of an undead army sink in. \u201cSo. With all of that in mind, our first real decision is whether or not to send the army to join Land Tillers' State   and The Kingdom of Belrow  in combating the undead that currently plague the lands of Aaedan. It is also worth considering, if we mobilize and deploy a considerable portion of the army, we would be that much more vulnerable to an attack.

I feel apprehension\u00a0about sending our soldiers to a battlefield where they will fall, stand again, and start attacking the men they once called brothers! I feel apprehension\u00a0about allowing a fearsome enemy to use our\u00a0soldiers, loyal men who have placed their absolute faith in you, against us! Am I truly that unfounded?\"Ryden's voice had once again reached that ringing sibilance he was so familiar with.\"Let us be honest, Madame, even with the forces of Aaedan and the Land-Tiller's state combined, we will still be able to stave off an assault on Isra. Our walls are tall and proud, and we would have our men more time to train. This plan of the general's is foolish in the extreme. You wish to offer our enemy some of the finest forces trained in the world for their own use, when we will suffer from their loss. You worry about the 'great machine' rolling up the Land-Tillers, well, what of our own people being made cruel puppets of this mysterious force's will?\"\"You ask me to come up with a plan to deal with this catastrophe, but the truth of the matter is, while I may have plans and ideas already, I can do nothing without more information from the scouts we have in the field. I am surprised that the High General attempted to make a plan without this crucial information, indeed. We must know the nature of these 'zombies', so that we may best formulate how to defeat them. Are they intelligent lifeforms? Do they retain their individuality to think and act as they did in life?  We must\u00a0know these things. Most of all, though, we must remember - the priority here should be preserving our own people's lives, not those of another entity. They must be prepared to defend themselves.\"Ryden took his seat again, passing the metaphoric baton back to the Madame for her answer.

I worked in the Treasury Department previously, yes? The way I finagled things following the coup that resulted in Goraia and lost us Medan as a trading partner, some eighty percent of foodstuffs imported into Isra on a monthly basis comes directly from The Expanse. That number may have fluctuated some in the last few months, but I\u2019m willing to bet- quite confidently, that it\u2019s a significant portion. More than two thirds of imported foods.\u201d \u201cWhich is, of course, to speak nothing of The Land Tiller\u2019s states other contributions, which are many and varied. I don\u2019t think we can justify to anyone simply standing by and watching the lot of them be consumed by undead. Between our relative strategic and economic reliance, and the long lasting semi-formal alliance between our peoples, I don\u2019t believe we can sit idly by and watch them be run down, if it comes down to that. I am no more willing to send our men to their deaths than you are, but defending The Expanse is akin to defending our eastern border. We cannot afford to let it fall completely.\u201d\u201cIt is worth considering that the forces of The Land Tiller\u2019s state are quite capable. Though the numerical value of their armed forces are quite small, they have all sorts of wyverns and powerful mages at the ready. It may be perfectly acceptable to sit back and allow them to handle their own defense. They maaay be capable of it. However, if they\u2019re not, not only will our eastern border be compromised, and not only will Isra struggle to feed itself, but those same very powerful mages will be blasting holes in our walls. I am of the opinion that if nothing else, we ought to ensure that The Land Tillers' State does not sustain casualties so great as to incapacitate them as a nation. It is of the utmost importance that they continue to stand, as they are one of the pillars that supports Isra in its current state.\u201d\u201cHowever, I agree.

It isn't\u00a0my home that is being attacked. My home was destroyed many years ago, in greater cataclysm than you face now. One day, my home, everything and everyone I loved and cherished was there, the next it was not. I had \u00a0no\u00a0chance to fight back, but even if I did, I would not have. I would not have, because I would have gained nothing by stupidly throwing myself against a force I knew I could not beat. And yet you and your legion, taken by ideas of pride, honour, and glory would rather send yourselves to your deaths and strengthen your enemy rather than possessing an iota of sense and retreating to regroup with a force like Isra, where you could meet the foe on common ground, not suffer the insult of having the lifeless corpses of your brothers- and sisters-in-arms returned to fight against you! Do you really think you could face that with fortitude? Do you really believe you could kill one of your band of brothers if they rose a blade against you? Because a flicker, a beat of hesitation would be all it took for them to kill you, and again you would be by their side, this time in death, working for the devious master who caused it.\"His tone hard, Ryden continued, not caring by this point if he offended the man. He was beyond that. \"I adopted this city of Isra as my new home, and I pledged to defend it. You say that you knew what this could become, and yet you did not act to prevent it as you should have. You took a foolhardy notion of glory into mind and made the enemy stronger. If you had thought about it, and retreated to draw the enemy away, you might have had a chance to defeat them. I do not wish to see the world burn, but I will do what it takes to protect those I have promised to. Pick your helmet up, soldier. Do not disrespect it and the legacy of your fallen comrades like that.\"Ryden turned from the rider, his furore falling away to the pleasant and impassioned disposition he reserved for political engagements usually. You could say many things about him, but nobody could deny that he knew how to pick his moments. \"As for the Lady, pleading the defence of the Land-Tillers' state because of food, well, Ministers, if she were to scrape the bottom of the barrel of excuses any further, she would get splinters under her fingernails! She has shamelessly manipulated her numbers to lead you to believe that we so greatly rely on them for food, when as a nation, we are so nearly self-sufficient that we should only need to rely on them for exotics that we could survive without! Nonetheless, I do still believe it is important we defend our semi-formal allies, as she says.\"\"The Lady speaks of justifying standing by, which is not what I seek to do. Which is not at any point which I have stated an intent or desire to do. I think, indeed, that it is more important that we protect our eastern border, but the solution to this is not, as I have said over, and over, and over again, charging ourselves into Aaedan, only to have our fallen rise against us. Without any supplementary evidence or information, seeing as we have not yet been provided with it, I would recommend to the ministers that we send our troops to fortify with the Land-Tillers on their borders. The information we have been provided with thus far indicates that the majority of the necromantic magic affecting Aaedan is only that - affecting Aaedan. If all forces present retreated to the borders of the Land-Tillers' State, a sufficient distance from the affected area that these reanimation rains would not reach, we could combat the dark forces effectively without the fear that our fallen comrades would be risen against us. It would also give us more time to use the scouting that the Dawn Riders provide to investigate the opposition further, and find any\u00a0more effective solution. This seems like the sensible and logical path forward, according to the information we have been provided thus far, and yet, Ministers, your Lady, Prime Minister, and High General broker for a solution that will inevitably end in the destruction of us all.

None of the soldiers I was able to speak with directly know for sure, and I can\u2019t quite tell, looking over their metaphorical shoulders with scrying.

However, for as much as you accuse me of manipulating the numbers, we are dependent on the Land Tillers for a great number of commodities. Isra is self-sufficient enough not to starve should all trade from The Expanse halt, yes, but what I said, that we would struggle, is true. The Free Plains are only capable of growing so many things, and there\u2019s a difference between living and living well. It would take another economic management miracle to re-establish the wealth of foodstuffs our citizens currently have easy access to. If you\u2019d like to visit the treasury department and go find out that it\u2019s seventy six percent of imports, or whatever the number is, go ahead, but Isra is mildly dependent on The Land Tillers' State, both strategically and economically and that much is not up for debate.\u201d\u201cStill, it seems as if we\u2019ve come to a conclusion. Send a force to The Expanse, have them establish fortifications outside the observed range of the magics. Provide to those who are in the process of fighting on the front lines a position to fall back to safely, and maybe send some supplies over as a show of good faith.

I hope you\u2019re not too attached to the current disorganized  and inefficient state of Isra\u2019s industry...\u201dStill focused on the documents before her, Naoki extends one hand out to grasp her cup of water. However, apparently her depth perception isn\u2019t quite all that, when it comes to grabbing things without looking at them. At least, when it comes to not having the things in question spill everywhere.Naoki herself is quick enough to stand and not allow any of the liquid to soil her garments, but not quite quick enough to save her precious documents. All she can do is watch, aghast as her painstakingly ordered sheets of parchment darken and meticulously written letters smear and run together. In a matter of moments, the entire stack is ruined beyond any reasonable hope of recovery. For a moment, she simply stands there, looking. As if staring at them hard enough would undo what has been done. However, an adept observer may notice the slight trickle of blood dripping from her upper lip as she struggles not to cry out in frustration. But there\u2019s nothing to be done. The presentation is ruined, and there isn\u2019t anyone to blame but herself. Leaving the drenched documents there on the table, Naoki moves off to go find something to dry the table with. After a short while, the Assembly meeting begins on time. Naoki\u2019s documents are nowhere in sight, having been discarded earlier as part of cleaning the table. However, her map display still stands in its place behind her seat, unharmed. After the standard pleasantries of beginning the meeting and checking to ensure that there are no urgently pressing matters to address first, Madame Naoki stands, taking the floor herself to begin the first matter of business.\u201cAs some of you who read today\u2019s meeting plan may or may not be aware, I am to give a presentation on my plan I had an  hour long presentation prepared for you all today, but in an uncharacteristic display of  clumsiness, I seem to have spilled my drink all over my notes, rendering them unfit for anything more than disposal.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019ll be getting the quick, purely oral version.\u201d\u00a0She punctuates this statement with a totally unrelated sensual licking of her lips, pausing for a moment before continuing,\u00a0\u201cTo get directly to the point, the purpose of my talk today is about making proper use of Isra\u2019s natural resources for the betterment of the city. This\u2026\u201dWith a gesture of her other hand, she indicates the display board, which is currently displaying a map. \u00a0\u201c...is, I hope at least a few of you are competent enough to realize, is a map of The Free Plains, and the areas surrounding it. We\u2019ve got the Norkari mountains up here toward the top, the forested border of The Expanse over there to the right, and so on. I should mention at this point- I\u2019m omitting the Norkari and the small villages and such. Their finances are not my concern. This area here, highlighted in blue\u2026 This is a rough approximation of where we farm things. Mostly in the large open fields to the south and west of the city, near to the river. We\u2019ve got a few artificial canals down here, that\u2019s all fine enough. We\u2019re using a few techniques taught to us by the Land Tillers a while back to farm more efficiently, but not very well, and not consistently. Some farmers are unaware, or are not applying the techniques properly.\u201d\u201cI have two plans in relation to farming that should be fairly non-conscientious. First and foremost, in an upcoming summit between Isra, The Kingdom of Gauldin  and The Land Tillers' State , I plan to suggest that The Land Tillers provide us again with their unmatched knowledge of coaxing the land into supporting life. Updated techniques, a reminder of how to practice the old ones, perhaps even some of their people to assist ours in setting up the requisite infrastructure. I\u2019m going to bargain for whatever I can get, and then attempt to distribute and encourage these advanced techniques as widely as possible across Isra\u2019s farmers. I figure it should go over reasonably well, because increasing their efficiency is congruent with increasing their gross profits.\u201d\u201cBefore I get into the second bit, let me first touch for a moment on the lumber industry. The areas in which Isran loggers primarily do their logging are displayed here in green. As you can see, the majority of lumber comes from up north, logging the forest that sits at the foot of the Norkari Mountains. The lumber is hauled south down this road, and into Isra.\u201d\u201cNow, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, per say. However, it is grossly inefficient. Look right here, look to the west. Look at the enormous forest that sits right across the river, that we aren\u2019t making use of. The primary reason this is the case is a mostly practical one. Consider, for a moment, your average lumberjack. What equipment does he have? An axe. Sure, that\u2019s implied. Probably has a few axes, speaking realistically. And then, presumably, a cart, on which to load the logs and haul them back to Isra. And then, perhaps some patterned shirts, or whatever else lumberjacks have. I haven\u2019t looked too far into the matter, to be honest.\u201d\u201cBut notably, not a boat. That\u2019s what I was getting at. The majority of lumberjacks do not own ferries. And as such, all of these trees over here\u2026\u201d she gestures to the woods to the east, on the opposite side of the Silverion River, \u201c...are inaccessible to them. They could charter some independent ferry to take them across and haul their logs back, or invest in their own ferry to do it themselves, sure, and a few do, but that\u2019s not the path of least resistance. The path of least resistance is to spend three hours each morning trudging all the way up to the mountains, logging there, and then another three hours trudging back. The same is true, to a more limited extent, of the farming. There are many more farms established on this side of the river than the other, because it\u2019s much easier.\u201d\u201cAs it stands, there are only a paltry handful of private bridges. None of them in particularly excellent locations, or both wide and strong enough to support the transport of substantial throughputs of goods. Most of them are tolled by their owners, as well. As such, I propose the following. The construction of a grand bridge, large enough to alleviate these issues of efficiency we face. Large enough to be incorporated into the eastern roads, large enough to allow the transport of lumber across it without issue, large enough to open up the entire eastern/southern side of the Silverion River for development and use.

His voice rang out across the chamber once more, as his eyes moved slowly between those of his contemporaries across the table. \"My fellow ministers, for those of you who I have not yet had the privilege of meeting, my name is Ryden Greyiron, and I have been duly appointed as the Judiciary Governor of Isra by Lady Naoki.\" A brief nod in her direction to acknowledge her was all that was given - Ryden had an energy and style that required constant engagement with his audience. He did not necessarily find it a privilege to meet the lethargic, sapping slobs who made up the majority of the Assembly, but if he wanted their support, had no choice but to play to their sympathies.\"The reason my appointment was so hasty was because of a disturbing prospect, one that I soon sadly found to be real and readily apparent. The Isran guard force was rife with corruption and bribery, perpetrated by an as-of-yet unknown organisation. Even more alarming, though, was the prospective thought that the rampant corruption ran high into the ranks - the captains, the commanders. In my thorough investigations of the hierarchy, it also led to me unearthing some interesting pieces of information about a certain member of the Assembly.\"This statement here was very calculated - Ryden watched each of the other ministers to see who blanched at the prospect of a secret being discovered. He would be having... discussions with those men later. \"Indeed, I discovered some most disturbing things about the past of one of our foremost leaders. In the process of my investigations, I found that our Prime Minister has no history dating back further than the foundation of Isra. While this alone is not cause for concern, the fact that I was undertaking a general corruption investigation led me to further look into this, and so I assigned one of the finest men on my taskforce, Inspector Deathforge, to probe into the past of the good Prime Minister, and he ascertained this.\" Ryden held up a sheaf of paper, tied together with 'Sephiran Investigation' scrawled on the front. \"This here is a signed affidavit that swears truthful the past of Tyrus Sephiran , and it contains some most terrifying things, chiefly among them being the fact that he was employed by the government of his homeland as a professional assassin. You did hear me right, everybody - our Prime Minister was a murderer, hired by the state to kill political targets. And this, ladies and gentlemen, forms the very base of the motion I wish to bring to the table today - I move no confidence in the Prime Minister of Isra, Tyrus Sephiran.\"Waiting for the shock and clamour from his announcement to die down, Ryden turned to the left, staring directly into the eyes of the Prime Minister as he continued to speak, his words clear and confident above the hushed conversation that filled the room. \"And while, ministers, I cannot say that the reason for this is because he is a murderer, for he has not been convicted, I will not say that it did not have any influence on my charge. In practise, though, I lay this argument on three bases - at the first, he is simply ineffective, at the second, he is incompetent, and at the third, even if we disregard the first two, there are still simply better alternatives.\"\"As much as I hate to speak poorly of the good Minister, he is quite simply ineffective. He does not contribute in a major way to the Assembly, the government, the bureaucracy, or the administrative functions of Isra, nor does he contribute to diplomacy or any foreign affairs. For someone who should be crucially important and vocal in our society, and in our politics, we simply don't hear from him. He resides in his estate and rests on his laurels, all the while the rest of us work hard to make up for the vacuum he leaves in the government. His unwillingness to do his job means that nobody else can, and seeing as this far he has been decidedly committed to proceeding the same way he has thus far, I think it is unreasonable for him to continue to take up this vital spot in our government.\"\"To add to that fact, every sliver of interaction I have seen of him thus far has rendered him in my eyes, and most hopefully in all of yours, incompetent. At the last Assembly meeting we held, an emergency sitting, he stood and endorsed a foolish proposal designed by the High General. When I accosted the Prime Minister about it, then gave an alternative plan, Tyrus back-pedalled on his words, leapt onto my ship and then tried to pass my plan off as his own! It only serves further to prove that his gross incompetence is preventing him from fulfilling his job to the high standard it must be.\"\"Finally, and perhaps most crucially, there are simply better people to do the job. I look around this great round table and I see many faces who could easily stand in the place of Tyrus and excel where he has not. I am aware of Tyrus' involved history with the city, yes, but that should be no reason to give him special treatment, especially when his time here has not actually benefited him, or us, in any way superior to that of any other. Ministers, as much as I appreciate how difficult\u00a0the role Tyrus plays in the government is, the simple matter of fact is that I have no confidence in his ability to lead this nation as a Prime Minister, especially considering that there are others who could do it considerably better.\"Ryden stood tall and proud for a moment more, gazing around the room to look at each of the ministers who sat at the round table, trying to gauge their reactions, before taking his seat as he continued his raking stare.", "link_list": ["/user/266"], "image_list": [], "html": "Standing, Ryden prepared to deliver his matters before any other minister was given the chance.

He was not sure where Ryden could have gotten such information, as Tyrus had traveled for nearly a decade to escape his past, but he had gotten it wrong. Tyrus was not about to give up his position, he had worked too hard to get this far and would be damned if this new Justice Governor was the cause of his political downfall. \"Quiet down everyone, there's no need for harsh words. I commend the governor in doing his job, but his accusations upon me are false and I shall deny them. This meeting was under the topic of industrial development, but it appears I must now defend my reputation. You began your supposed investigation under the guise of rooting out corruption, but your investment in trying to dig up dirt on me has been a waste. I have been a civil servant of this city since it's beginning and the people know me as an honest man. To accuse me of being a cutthroat is akin to calling the Grand General a baker, though I do not actually know his baking talents this is just a metaphor. I've operated for years as minister of foreign affairs and have cultivated fine relationships with each nation I've visited, and I had the pleasure of calling our former Lord Ildesias Xen Torsal my friend and colleague, his trust in me was for good reason as I was his right hand man. If he were here himself he would vouch for me, but he is not so I will have to rely on the good word of everyone else.\"Tyrus looked around at all of the fine men he's worked with for almost half a decade, he had become acquainted with most of them and many had voted for him in the election. As expected a large portion of the ministers nodded or said something in agreement, he'd continue after that brief moment. \"These men and women know me, including Lady Naoki as we were both senior cabinet members together for almost two years before her election where she defeated me in political battle. Despite my loss I supported her election and I even had her over for dinner that same night where I got to know her a little better and met her lovely daughter Skarlet. I was not a assassin as you claim, but a soldier in my old life, as were many of us here, we killed for our nation and there's no shame in that. I chose to leave that life behind when I came to the free plains and witnessed the raising of this citadel, I like many others saw the Free City as a chance at new beginnings; And so I got mine, replacing my sword with a quill and I have worked tirelessly in each role I have been placed in. Your slander toward me on how I'm supposedly incompetent and don't do my job is questionable as is the source of your information sir, for if you really had someone spying on me they would see that I, in fact go so far as to bring my work home with me even and give up the late hours of the night to examine proposed laws and policies with scrutiny making sure every t is crossed and each i dotted, every legislation goes by me before even being considered by Lady Naoki. I haven't even taken the time to start a family because all of my time is dedicated to my career.\"Tyrus gave Ryden a look of disgust, he had thought this new justice minister, or governor as it's called now, was a decent man upon his previous meetings of him, but apparently he was wrong. \"Your delivery of misinformation is either a testament to the failure of your spy ring, for if they were truly observing me they would tell you all of this, or you are purposely leaving out the truth while you tell your lies in an attempt to slander my name that I've made for myself these past four years serving Isra with my unwavering loyalty! For you and your spies to produce falsifications instead of actual results in your search for corruption, it is not only an offense to my pride but an offense to those who put you in your position! I do my duty for Isra, and I would expect the same from anyone else.\"The Prime Minister was finished with his defense. Everyone knew he had always delivered in his duty and he had never shown that his loyalty was to anywhere besides Isra and it's Lord/Lady. He combed back a stray lock of hair that had freed itself from his ponytail and seated himself once more. \"If we're done with petty politicking, I believe our Lady\u00a0has a vastly more productive issue to present.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Many ministers had something to say, some spoke of the possibilities of Ryden's investigation, others were in outrage at this insult to one of their most trusted officials.

I believe that the serious allegations and the motion of no confidence that has been laid before the Assembly are in fact the most important issue we face currently. I'm afraid you cannot get rid of them with a single speech.\"A few murmurs of agreement floated in from around the table - nobody was prepared to speak out against Tyrus the way they did against Ryden, but he would soon change that. He turned back to the rest of the Assembly from where he had been addressing Tyrus specifically.\"Ministers, Prime Minister Sephiran slanders me by accusing me of falsifying reports. I am the judiciary governor - quite literally an officer of the law. I have better things to do with my time than creating fanciful documents in order to convict one of our leaders, such as rooting out corruption, which is actually my job. Why, then, would I send one of my top investigative agents on a wild goose chase to make up said fanciful documents, when he could be performing a more reasonable, useful job? The simple answer is thus - I wouldn't. Which will draw you all to the logical conclusion that these reports are not falsified, and therefore completely true. I have multiple signed affidavits from the sir's homeland, swearing that he served as an assassin for the government, that I will make available to you all for perusal at your leisure. The short and simple truth of it is thus. He was an assassin, he killed people for money, and he did it on behalf of his government. Prime Minister Sephiran is right, though - I do do my duty to Isra, and part of it is this motion. We cannot allow ruinous, negligent figures to hold power in our country.\"Ryden paused briefly, his eyes flickering down to the documents that lay in his are of the table. The next points he had to address were scrawled across the right line, leaving him with a clear and logical flow of the argument he had to undertake.\"Ministers, the Prime Minister would have the motion of no confidence tossed aside because of his baseless degradation of my other charges, which we have already conclusively proven to be true. This, of course, is wrong, because as I said at the very beginning, his past forms only a facet of the reason I believe he should be removed from his position. I shall revisit those three points for you, summed up as briefly as possible - ineffectiveness, incompetence, and the existence of superior replacements. He has attempted to brush off the latter two by only addressing the first, something which I find treacherous and manipulative tot he extreme, and something that I hope you all bear in mind as we further listen to his excuses.\" Ryden looked around the table, hoping that he had further sowed some uncertainty as to Tyrus' integrity. \"Never have I at any point had somebody spying on the Prime Minister. That is something I will state with utter honesty. Yes, I have had a Inspector Deathforge investigate his history, but nobody has staked out his house, or any such nonsense like that. Still, ladies and gentlemen, I find it very hard to believe his claim of him needing to take work home or, heavens forbid, give up some of his 'late hours' to examine proposed policies, laws and legislation. No policy or legislation I have ever instituted has ever been passed through his hands, even though, if he had only asked, I would have happily gave them to him for perusal. In fact, I don't believe he would ever add to the scant amount of work he does during the day to his night hours, let alone crossing every 't' and dotting every 'i', and if his job in Isra only amounts to crossing 't's and dotting 'i's, well, it's little wonder I call him incompetent, if that is in fact all he manages to do. We do not need an overglorified punctuation examiner as our Prime Minister.\"Ryden managed to get a chuckle from a few members of the Assembly with that statement - they were beginning to warm up to him and his argument, and little wonder, considering that they were based on sense and reason. \"The Prime Minister speaks about all of his foreign affairs experience, and yet what trade deals or agreements has he ever brokered? None to my knowledge, and certainly none to written Isran history. It took our Lady, Naoki, only one visit to Gauldin to secure an informal alliance and a trade deal! Again, I find myself coming back to those two key reasons I established - ineffectiveness and incompetence, two values which I have demonstrated in Tyrus consistently. Perhaps last in this bout of statements from me, I personally find it dishonourable that the Prime Minister should bring Lord Ildesias into this argument. After all, he resigned because of fatigue. Why was Tyrus not undertaking this massive workload then in order to take some stress of the back of our great founder? Why was he left in a position where he had to stand down of fatigue, a most mundane cause? Perhaps, if the better alternatives I have spoken about were present then, Lord Ildesias would not have reached a state of tire in which he was forced to depart from leading the city he created, because he would not have been so stressed and overworked! Ladies and gentlemen, quite simply, Prime Minister Sephiran is incompetent, ineffective and overshadowed by superior alternatives, not to mention a government-hired contract killer. It's time for him to stand down, or be stood down.\"These strong statements from Ryden proved to be much more popular amongst the Ministers of the Assembly, especially the point about Lord Ildesias.

He went on to talk about all of the following: He was one who brokered peace and trade deals with every neighboring nation and even to those as far away as Iveria and Aaedan. Anyone who's lived in Isra the past 4-5 years would know all of this. All of what Ryden said was nothing but contrary to what the truth was. Tyrus had even brokered deals between other nations, when Land Tiller's State attacked Goraia, Tyrus was there to broker the ceasefire between the two nations. First contact with Aaedan and all trade following, peace with the Norkari and annexation of their territory, opening relations with Sactum Imperium Ivelius with lasting non-aggression and trade of exotic goods, friendship with the Land Tiller's State, continued trade with the Kingdom of Medan up until the point of Goraia's rising where all trade was cut and the nation went into isolation, First Contact with Belrow and following relations, Initial friendship with The Phoenix Imperium until they started getting shifty and Isra had to mobilize for defense.

The tables were set out in a randomised order, with the Isran in the centre of the front row, and the others arcing out from there. The outer two tables on the left and right rear arms were dedicated to spectators. Each table, sporting the flag of its' assigned nation as well as large pitchers of water and glasses to suit, optimally seated ten people, with ample room for taking notes or writing messages. These messages would be carried around the room by a team of page boys, who would also be responsible for the refilling of the water pitchers. The large, comfortable chairs that usually contained Assembly members would be arranged around these tables, in quantities as required.\u00a0Directly opposite from the Isran table, and set an equal distance back from the centre, was the area for the speaker, from where they would be able to address the room. A wrap-around table, with a lectern protruding from the front, it was designed for the speaker to be able to stand at and deliver with their notes set out around them. A small glass of water accompanied, which would be refilled between speeches. To the right of the speaker's dais sat the chairman's table, at which the Chancellor of Isra and host of the summit would be seated. Identical to the other tables in the room, it was emblazoned with the Chancellor's official heraldry, rather than that of any nation. Seated with him were three scribes, who would be responsible for recording of all events of the meeting, a duty that they were familiar with, having performed it for the Assembly since its' very inception. Joining them would be an Enclave mage who would be responsible for controlling the magical amplifiers each table was equipped with.\u00a0Around the room, while ensuring that the details of the wall were not obscured, the heraldry and banners of the city of Isra, the Lady, the Chancellor and the Assembly would hang suspended above the delegates below.Once all of this preparation was completed, everybody was escorted out by the Lord Steward of the Citadel, who afterwards locked the door, ensuring that the room would not be entered until the day of the great congress.

Black Tower international police, whatever you wish to call it, I am not too familiar with mainland politics so I only have hearsay and first impression here to go off of, while some nations may be totally willing to be part of it, others hold animosity toward eachother and likely do not wish to work together. As for my Aozora, at this point and time I do not have the resources to spare for such an endeavor, all of my funds are required for raising and training my men and I need my best fighters for my campaign.

She addressed the entire delegation, not just High Naoki and Jarkoopi.<br/><br/>If she was given the floor, she would speak. \"What if there was a provision which prevented any single nation from gaining dominance over all others? What if there was a provision to respect the sovereignty of all nations regardless of their participation in the international accord?\" Alanis' voice was soft, but highly articulate and measured, lending her the gravitas befitting a century old sapient being.<br/><br/>\"I can perceive immediately that both the High Lady of Isra and Goraia's champion both speak a degree of truth. Before this inevitably results in a breakdown of diplomacy, please allow me to impart what wisdom I can offer to this great council.\" <br/><br/><i>Oh boy here we go.</i> Jun and Raynor groaned to themselves.<br/><br/>\"You see, one of the most treasured virtues of the elves of the Expanse is <i>balance</i>. The various dichotomies of our philosophies and our natures, have evolved over eons, as we struggle to survive and thrive in the natural world. Violence, peace, individual sovereignty, and obedience and loyalty, even the male and female forms, are all part of this progression. As such, as sentient beings and even as entire nations, we often find it easier to embody a particular part of the spectrum. This explains the fundamental differences in the comportment of the nation of Goraia and of, say, Gauldin. I am not here to comment on how... optimal, these chosen natures are, but only to explain their existence.\"<br/><br/>After giving the delegation a few seconds to process Alanis' long-winded and overbearing speech (even Elder Havador had to suppress a yawn), Alanis continued. \"If we are to pursue a lasting peace, we cannot demand any sort of overt homogeneity between the nations. Every individual nation must choose its path, and we must recognize the merits and flaws of all our nations. For in our diversity we inherently\u00a0represent the balance of mother nature. Our international accord must respect and honor this balance. This is why I recommend a provision to protect the sovereignty of all nations and prevent a single nation from exercising too much control over all other nations.\"<br/><br/>After one more brief pause, Alanis added a closing summary. \"In summary, we walk on a thin bridge. And should we fall off either side, then we may face war. A lack of commitment towards peace from otherwise divided nations, as Lady Naoki suggests, will lead to war. But as Jarkoopi states, so too would a lack of respect for the individual sovereignty of our nations.\"<br/><br/>At some point while Alanis was talking, Jun would look towards the orb and wave shyly while smiling sheepishly. Jarkoopi was the first dragon she had ever befriended. The fact that they were on opposite sides of a major political issue was awkward to say the least. When she was done she poked her father in the shoulder, who was starting to nod off.<br/><div class=\"quote_clear\"></div></br></div></div>"}, "post-48830": {"user": "King Averin Arach", "user_num": 1234, "timestamp": "1473193331000", "message": "Averin listened to the entire debate between Naoki, Jarkoopi, and now Alanis.

In regards to those stone orcs, I\u2019m not proposing that we ask them to honor these standards, only that we hold ourselves- as governments and nations, to these standards. If you\u2019d like to defend yourself from those orcs, that would be fine- it would be preposterous to suggest otherwise. And likewise, if you need to remove them from an area because they are posing a substantial threat to you or your people, as so long as you\u2019re not overly cruel about it, that would also probably be alright. The only matter in which these guidelines might affect that situation is that you would presumably be discouraged from killing all of the orcs without reason. No genocide.\u201d\u201cAs for limitations on spells or weapons\u2026\u201d Naoki shrugs. \u201cI would think that they wouldn\u2019t be explicitly regulated, but rather interpreted.

Or a magic of the same sort that we\u2019ve recently witnessed, for that matter.\u201dNaoki punctuates this statement with a tilt of the head in Nyx\u2019s direction and a respectful moment of silence for the dead. After the moment, she continues, casually and with a shrug, \u201cWe may decide that such magics- if found, are illegal because the use of them would be in direct violation of the laws. And again, presumably. We\u2019ve obviously only just begun, I\u2019m only offering comments based on how I think these laws ought to be constructed- which is my personal opinion. All of this is here on the metaphorical table for discussion.\u201d\u201cHowever,\u201d Naoki continues, rounding to face Renaux and address his point, \u201cI think I may have been unclear again. To create separate guidelines in such a way would undermine the legitimacy of the concept I intend to get at. It isn\u2019t just that we- as governments, agree to respect individuals who are our own citizens, and the citizens of other nations who will, in turn, respect our citizens, but rather that we are respecting individuals, full stop.\u201dShe lets this point hang in the air for a moment before continuing, \u201cIt is my personal belief that all sapient individuals- while not perhaps precious or sacred, ought to be afforded some basic respects- and be offered some inalienable rights by the civilised nations of this world. The right to their own life. The right to be free, practice whatever religion they might care to, and not be sold into unwilling servitude. Things like that. I am not as idealistic or naive enough to suggest that we ought to end all wars forever and say that one ought not to kill even in self-defense. Simply that if violence is unavoidable, we ought to at least approach the topic of taking lives with respect for those lives we intend to take and the gravity of the action, and treat all sapient beings with some small amount of respect.\u201d\u201cAs such, creating separate sets of laws depending on to which nation- if any, an individual \u2018belongs to\u2019 is - beyond being a highly arbitrary factor to consider, completely at odds with the motion I am proposing, and as such, I am wholly against the idea. These laws we create ought to be international and the rights they give inalienable. They ought to apply to every individual- as an individual is defined, equally, without discrimination or distinction based on any factor.\u201dWith this statement firmly delivered, Naoki offers Renaux a nod- intending to show that she intends to disagree with but not disrespect him, and seats herself.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "As Jun and Renaux voice their input, Naoki shakes her head, indicating the negative.

However, as it seems that she\u2019s expected to take the floor, she does, standing silently for a moment before beginning- uncharacteristically hesitant. \u201cWell, I agree with Havador. What he said was entirely correct- we don\u2019t need to abuse basic rights even to do war. Furthermore, what sustains and legitimises these sorts of mutual agreements are the other involved parties. If one nation infringes upon the rights we choose as inalienable, it is the responsibility of the other involved nations to take action depending on the severity of the infraction. I don\u2019t believe that Isra would hesitate to.\u201dWith this, Naoki offers a small shrug. She doesn\u2019t quite understand what all Crovan is getting at, this seems simple enough to her, to challenge the very basis of it at this point seems out of place. \u201cRegardless, I think it about time that we sit down and begin hashing out the details\u2026\u201dGesturing, Naoki beckons the leading parties to the center of the room,  single unmarked table stands, adorned only with writing supplies.

Penned by Naoki\u2019s hand and broken into two portions, The International Accord of Universal Rights and Protections is born. It reads as follows. The undersigned delegates representative of all governments and powers present at this Conference, held on the Seventh of Winter's Heart do affirm and pledge their sacred honor to upholding the following statutes.Part One: Individual Rights\tArticle OneAll sapient beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. \tArticle TwoEveryone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, species, gender, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.  Furthermore, no distinction shall be made on the basis of the political, jurisdictional or international status of the country or territory to which a person belongs.\tArticle ThreeEveryone has the right to life, liberty and security of person. This includes security from acts including, but not limited to, rape, excessive torture, castration, and other such mutilations. \tArticle FourNo one shall be held in slavery or servitude; slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms.  \tArticle FiveEveryone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.Part Two: In matters of warEvery prisoner of war, defined herein as any combatant pledged in service to a country or nation who is captured by an opposing country or nation, shall be afforded several unalienable rights. These will be respected and protected by all signers of this document.1.) Prisoners of war shall not be required to surrender information aside from their basic identity to their captors. The usage of torture to involuntarily extract information from any prisoner shall not be permitted by any signing member.2.) Prisoners of war shall have their right to humane treatment reflected in their living arrangements. Running water, no less than two meals a day, and satisfactory sleeping quarters must be provided by all member countries and nations. The usage of solitary confinement for any period lasting over two (2) weeks constitutes a violation of a prisoner\u2019s right to humane treatment.     \t\ti.) In order to enforce this, an authorized neutral body must have free and unlimited     abilities to inspect any and all camps used to house prisoners of war.3.) Prisoners of war have the right to basic correspondence, limited to the sending and receiving of lettersi.) Captors retain the right to search and censor all communications, so long as such actions do not violate a prisoner\u2019s right to communication.4.) Attempts made by prisoners of war to escape their place of confinement must not be constituted as an offense deserving of punishments that would violate the prisoner\u2019s right to humane treatment.  The undue punishment of prisoners recaptured after an escape attempt, defined hereafter, constitutes a violation of a prisoner's right to humane treatment.\ti.) Torture or physical harm designed to impair movement.\tii.)  Removal of body parts.\tiii.) Mental torture designed to impair or afflict the mental capacities.5.) Prisoners of war hailing from countries or nations who have not signed this document must be afforded the basic rights as outlined above.Enforcement \tCountries and nations found to be in violation of any or all of the above shall be subjected to immediate expulsion from this body, resulting in the revoking of all protections provided by this document. Fines may also be levied, the amount of which will be determined dependent upon the severity of the transgression(s). The parties below agree to uphold the statements written above and serve as the neutral monitoring and supportive force to ensure adherence to the statutes herein.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Nodding slightly, Naoki finds that she doesn\u2019t really have that much to add.
