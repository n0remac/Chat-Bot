Its collection is not nearly as large of that of The Library of Isra but is still quite expansive in its own right. In addition to a large selection of \u2018regular' books, many tomes specifically related to subjects relevant to governance and the administrative functions performed at The Citadel are available for study here, in addition to a collection of rare books of which only a single edition has been made. Further, all laws of Isra and historical records are stored here, and available for government officials to access. The library itself is filled with only the finest furniture and kept clean by aides. Cushioned seats surround large hardwood tables, ideal for a group to sit at and discuss matters between themselves. Cubbies built into the walls have single desks for personal study, and there are even cushioned nooks for relaxing in. A fireplace in the center of the library burns continually, and its light is supplemented with sunlight streaming in through high windows, and candles mounted on the walls. Members of The Assembly often spend time here composing documents and proposals for use in their meetings. Military officers visit regularly to learn and improve their knowledge of tactics and grand strategy, studying accounts of historical battles and reading the words of great generals of the past. Further, this library is a common place for Citadel residents of all sorts to spend their free time, as a quiet and comfortable setting far removed from the hustle and bustle present elsewhere.
