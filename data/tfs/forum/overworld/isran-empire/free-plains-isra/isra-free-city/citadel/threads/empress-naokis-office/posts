For an important politician, she was dressed very modestly, in clothing that would be as suitable to an evening in a bar as it would in a diplomatic union. He would not judge, though, for his armor was hardly more purposed to diplomacy. He noticed her beauty, as well; while she was not possessing some of the qualities that he himself favored, he could see she would be very... popular amongst some, for those very reasons.

Well, I\u2019ve not the time to impart upon you the full history of Isra or the detail of its policies, but you should understand at least this abbreviated version.\u201d\u201cIsra, at the time, only called \u201cThe Free City\u201d, was founded roughly five years ago in this plain. It was founded by a mixed group of deposed leaders, merchants, soldiers, and other associated citizenry from all walks of life who were seeking a superior and more free life than they had been allowed in whatever land they had come from. I was among them, a hanger- on, without any particular significance.\u201dMadame Naoki selects from the items on her desk the quill that she had evidently been using earlier, the ink on the tip having dried by now. Between two of the fingers on her left hand, she begins to spin the quill about, causing the feathered end to bob rhythmically with the tempo of her speech. \u201cIn the years since, the city was named, Isra, and has grown into the highly populated and prosperous city we stand in today. Since its conception, Isra\u2019s primary governing body has been an Assembly, of one hundred Ministers. The current total is somewhat smaller- only eighty-three. Ministers are chosen by a combination of public elections, appointment by officials, and conscription by the Assembly itself in a complicated set of rules and ratios that I can\u2019t be bothered to explain right now. Regardless, it is through this democratic body of The Assembly that all major decisions must be made. My station as Lady only allows me a limited degree of direct authority over the high level administrative decisions of Isa. However, discluding the largest of matters, such as war, major changes to the governmental structure or laws, I am able to make mostly unilateral decisions, though they may be repealed or anger the Assembly later.\u201d\u201cAs far as policies go, Isra\u2019s focus so far has been most closely aligned with the concepts of freedom, libertarianism... tolerance, neutrality\u2026\u201d She counts on her fingers as she lists the concepts. \u201cAnd free trade, I suppose. There\u2019s more to be said about the nuances of each concept and how it is applied literally, but again\u2026\u201d Naoki gestures to the list, implying that she still has just as many things to do as when they started this conversation. \u201cOne of the concepts that hasn\u2019t yet been emphasized, however, is security. I\u2019m not sure how much time you spent observing the streets on your way in, or the roads on your travels, but there are far more threats to Isra and its people about than I would really prefer. Criminals, bandits, monsters, debatably hostile bordering nations, spies, the list goes on. On and on, longer than it really should be. And, to be fair, the city guard does an admirable job of keeping the worst sorts out, monitoring the road, and protecting merchants, but not as thorough a job as I would like. Our military is adequate enough that I don\u2019t actively fear large scale invasion or anything of that sort, but it is sometimes the death-by-a-thousand-cuts, or the issues that eat a nation from the inside out that are the most deadly. The sorts of things I can\u2019t sic a platoon of griffin cavalry on to make them go away.\u201d\u201cAs such, I\u2019m looking to find individuals to be part of a new department of the government. One primarily concerned with defense of the interior, criminal justice, oversight of other departments, and other similar sorts of tasks. A department to ensure that I can focus on the external affairs, rather than the internal threats.

But I believe you ask what justice means to me. And that, that is a kettle of worms in and of itself. I believe that justice is the what the law requires it to be. For a street criminal who stole a man's purse? We take back the purse, and take one of his fingers as punishment. For a street criminal wo stole my purse? Well, I'd want both of his hands, and while that may be just, it may not be a correct application of justice. I would thus define justice as however the law should define it. The virtue of being just, though, well, then, I believe it is what is right in the mind of the victim, not the government.\u00a0So I would ask of you this question, my lady. When you are look for a judiciary officer, what is more important - justice, or a capacity to be just?\"This was something that had occured as a thought to him on many occasions, but never before had he needed to express it.

In the intervening time\u2026\u201dPlacing the quill back down on the desk, she reaches next with her right hand to her left, placing index and thumb around her left fourth finger. However, there\u2019s nothing there to grasp at; simply a light crease suggesting a ring was once worn there.The habit of authenticating documents with a stamp of her signet ring is a habit that isn\u2019t so easily broken, it seems. And, until her new ring is finished, one that she won\u2019t be able to practice. Though she supposes that she could technically send for a traditional stamp bearing Isra\u2019s insignia, she cannot be bothered to do so, instead opting to simply sign the document with another flourish of the quill, before placing it on the desk before Ryden. \u201cTake this.

In Asgeir, a Buunvar is a massive beast; they're peaceful grazers and keep to themselves - but if provoked, no creature can withstand their ferocity.

Should a dragon come to burn one, the hide would protect it; in fact, Buunvar were once known to charge through the dragons fire, and ram their underbellies with sharp horns - killing them.  Buunvar were the first dragonslayers.\"  Aia said the last statement almost like a joke.\"Our ancestors hunted these beasts for their bones, hides, and meat; it was a rite of passage.  Later, when dragons plagued our lands, our heroes took the hide and created great cloaks to shield themselves from dragons fire.  This allowed our warriors to get in close and slay the foul beasts.  Now, I present the hide to you, Naoki.  For allowing my people to stay in the Free City.  You can cut it, dye it, tailor it - do what you wish to do with it - but as long as you wear it no fire shall ever harm you; not even dragons fire.\"The Buunvar hide would very well be decorated however Naoki wished; but the rough texture would always remain.

It\u2019s her opinion that anything related to fashion trends would hardly fall into Crovan\u2019s set of duties, but the essence of what Cassandra is getting at is clear enough. Here is an asset Naoki has yet to have the opportunity to make use of, a noblewoman. The majority of Isra\u2019s governmental officials have been present since Isra\u2019s foundation, members of that original group of refugees who possessed some manner of skill that would be mildly useful in such a context. Over the years, of course, some have come and gone, but only some. Of the current group, few could plausibly be considered noble, the most notable of which Naoki has put into place herself. Even then, there aren\u2019t enough to count on two hands, and only Crovan possesses something that could plausibly be categorized as a noble house. There is no noble class in Isra. Which is fitting and probably very intentional, Naoki supposes. She certainly wouldn\u2019t be one to start granting power based on bloodline, and it would be unacceptable to recognize some families as superior to others. But. With that in mind, cultivating a group of loyal, high-class families could be quite useful as another way to exert influence. But that would be a much longer term sort of plan. For now, Naoki resolves to begin by setting up Cassandra. \u201cI think that you may not immediately be well suited to a high office, as you yet lack most of the requisite contextual and leaderships skills needed to head any sort of department. You could plausibly do well not in a leadership position, but perhaps as a diplomat, but I\u2019m not yet comfortable enough with you to send you about to speak in my name. It would be best for you to begin by establishing yourself. You seek to make a way and a name for yourself independent of your brother, so why not begin by doing just that.\u201dUsing her free hand, Lady Naoki slides a blank bit of paper to sit before her, dips the quill she\u2019s been twirling, and begins to write as she talks.\u201cThere is no hereditary transfer of power here in Isra, only the opinion of the public. If you give the public a reason to dislike you, you will be disliked, and find it more difficult to accomplish your goals as a result. Begin to consider your actions through the eyes of the everyman, and be cautious not to anger him. If you are well liked and respected prior to attempting to, say, win an election\u2026\u201d Trailing off, Naoki raises her arms up to either side implicatively, letting the results speak for themselves. After a moment, she turns back down and resumes her scribbling. \u201cRight now, your slate is blank. Those with particularly strong opinions about your brother may associate those feelings with you as well, and those you\u2019ve already met will have their own opinions, but the public does not know you. As such, you\u2019ll begin by constructing a house here in Isra. Constructing, specifically, not purchasing, for two reasons. The first is that I don\u2019t believe there are any suitable residences current available, and the second would be to seed awareness of yourself. Ensure that the workers are treated well, come by to observe their progress a few times, and perhaps treat the lot of them to something at the job\u2019s completion to ensure that they come away with a positive impression.\u201d\u201cThen, once you\u2019ve moved in and properly established yourself in the city, begin to look into business. Ideally, you would learn to manage such things yourself, but you probably ought to hire an expert at least to begin with. I'll lend you some of my people to use until you find your own. Your first business goal will be to establish a reliable income for yourself. I\u2019m sure that House Winter will be willing to cover your expenses to an extent, and I may be persuaded to fund the rest, but you do not want to be reliant on the charity of others in the long term. One option is to purchase an existing business, the other is to create one of your own. Ideally, you want to get into a stable market, one which will always see business. Whatever you decide to do, you want to personally involve yourself in the business to an extent. Be present, be pleasant, and earn yourself the respect of your employees.\u201dPlacing her quill back into the holder, Naoki spends a moment looking over what she\u2019s written before turning up to look Cassandra in the eye and ask, \u201cAt that point, you will have accomplished your goal of becoming someone notable in your own right, and be in a good position to advance further.

I plan to increase commercial fishing, employing mages with ice spells to allow for long-distance transportation and sale. Also, we have a large population of whales off the coast, just waiting to be fished. They can be used for a whole variety of purposes, such as oil, whalebone, and ambergris.

I've noticed a large number of transient minors, what some call 'street urchins', wandering the streets of Isra. They're known by shopkeepers and business owners to cause mischief and steal small items to support themselves. Some are taken in by street gangs and unscrupulous businesses, forced into selling fairy dust or other distasteful things. The program will take these children off the streets and make sure that they are clothed and fed while providing housing and education (reading/writing, basic arithmetic, etc), all in return for work. They will learn valuable job skills, and be fully prepared to enter the workforce as skilled labor when they become adults. Crime rates will drop as the urchins are kept busy with useful, legitimate work, keeping them out of trouble and away from unsuspecting pockets. We can have them work in keeping the city clean, work in product manufacturing, or other such jobs that benefit from small hands. Life in the program would be much preferable to living on the streets, with warm beds, dry clothes, and sufficient food. It also gives the children a future to look forward to, rather than condemning them to life on the streets forever.\"He grinned. This was his master plan. A win-win situation for everyone, really.

So far as he was aware he was among the, if not the, longest serving consistent employee she had. Though he supposed he wasn't technically an employee anymore, he was a... Appointed official? Despite that, he realizes that he didn't think they'd once had a private conversation that was purely social. Oh sure, they'd had social visits with each other before but they usually involved others mostly his kids. They, however, had never simply had a chat he didn't know much about her and he wasn't sure how much she really knew about him. Mostly because for the longest time he'd simply viewed her as the boss, the place orders came from. It was only recently he'd started to realize people could be more than one thing. As his children grew he'd seen them develop into more than just, tiny things I must love and protect. They were becoming individuals and he found he enjoyed spending time with them because they were different from himself. This was something that had never really occurred to the former assassin and as he comes to her desk and she stands he realizes, that technically speaking Naoki was his oldest friend.\u00a0So maybe he shouldn't have been surprised when the empress got up and extended her arms partially. It was body language he recognized well, it was close to what his children did when they wanted a hug. With only slight hesitation he gives her a hug, once that is done he steps back. \"The children are good. Little Naoki finished all the books you sent her, she wants to know when she can return to the Citadel library.\" He chuckles lightly at this wondering how long that will last her. \"As for me, that is what I'd like to talk about.

He certainly hasn\u2019t softened in that regard, Naoki thinks. Feels almost like one of those statues from that one time. Bit warmer.In any case, what Alden has to say about the children is good, and of her namesake - amusing enough to warrant a few tasteful giggles, and she makes as much clear.

But this flame was quickly extinguished, smothered by the shieldmaiden's professional constitution.  \"Isra is my home,\" she said plainly, \"and you are its lady.  I serve you as is expected of me.\"Perhaps Naoki did not understand Aia's reply, or perhaps she did.  In either case, it was evident that the loyalty, honor, and sense of duty prevalent in Varan culture persisted even in those who settled abroad.  As far as Aia and her followers concerned Naoki was their High Queen, just as Ulfr was their High King back home.Lady Heijra crossed her arms and considered what she could possibly want from Naoki.  She had already established a permanent home for her people, and she was certain Naoki could be counted as their closest ally.\u00a0 There was very little the Varan desired, and so very little that Aia desired.\"Nothing,\" she concluded, quite plainly.  \"I don't want anything you have to offer.\"  If it were not for her otherwise friendly tone, one might think Aia's reply was rude and deserved reproach - but the lady meant nothing by it, as evidenced by her continued reply.\"You can, however, do something for my people.  The Varan are warriors, Naoki.  They will fight to the last man, woman, and child to defend Isra's high walls - but to sit behind them in safety will only make them weak and docile.  Give them fire, give them steel, and they will give you victory in the wars to come.  They are the Headsman's Axe; you are the Headsman.  And when the time comes, I shall lead them into battle for you, and to that end I suppose I should request a seat on your moot.\"Aia had one final theatric before she finished.  She reached behind her and unsheathed the ancestral sword which hung across her back.  The boar-shaped pommel, dark gray blade, and scattered runes set it apart from the meager steel sword at her hip.  Judging by its appearance Naoki could deduce the weapon was old, dating back to an ancient and forgotten age.  The runes which covered the entirety of the blade belonged to a mysterious, lost language.  It was quite a spectacle to see.But this was just one of many. Almost every warrior from Asgeir carried one.  It was their ancestral blade: honorary heirlooms to be passed down from father to son, and from mother to daughter.  They were rarely used, if at all, for no Varan dared to harm the integrity of the ancient weapons.\"Literature is a luxury that only nobles can afford, and so the commonfolk rely on oral traditions.  Over time, however, it becomes hard to discern truth from legend.  And there are some legends that speak of great warriors who wield the very Weapons of the Old Gods.  Stories of heroes and heroines conjuring fire, calling forth a storm of hail and lightning, or shaking the very earth.  But, as I am sure you know, the Varan cannot learn magic: we are far to resistant to the effects of the arcane arts.  And so our ancestors relied on runic magic.  But that art has been lost to us.  I regret to tell you that I cannot even read the runes on my own sword.\"Sheathing the blade, Aia approached Naoki with newfound interest.  \"For now, my people can serve you as mere infantry - and though it is a role they will fulfill dutifully and efficiently - it is only a fraction of what they are capable of.  Help me unlock the Gifts of the Old Gods, Naoki, to turn legend into truth, and I swear to you Isra will stand the test of time.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "A sense of price and accomplishment began to rise within Aia, like a fire beneath dry timber.

She shares characteristics with others who already work in Naoki\u2019s circles. Aia will be a capable general, Naoki has no doubt.It will be interesting to see, Naoki thinks, how her story will pan out. If she would have herself as a loyal commander, Naoki will have her, and be grateful for it. But she\u2019s the sort of woman, Naoki thinks, who would lead a revolution just as happily.

Because \u2014 among other reasons, every bit of power one bestows can be turned against them. This is especially true in matters such as this, matters of soldiers and politics.

Because if she isn\u2019t careful, Aia will develop into an independent actor with power, authority, and a following. The soldiers will not use their own equipment; they will use Isran equipment and look like Isran soldiers - because they will be Isran, soldiers, fighting for Isra. Not Varan soldiers fighting for House Heijra.The distinction is necessary, Naoki feels. The Varan, they will be Varan, certainly. Specialised. With shared heritage. But they will be Isran first. Their common background will not be used to distance themselves or draw lines. Their bond will be similar to the bond shared by soldiers from the same neighborhood put in the same cohort, not to that of contracted mercenaries. Lady Naoki will be keeping a close eye on this with the intention to prevent the formation of a subfaction. This is a one party government and it will remain as such.

A large number of tribal orcs crossed the Medanese mountains into the Free Plains and proceeded\u00a0to launch an unprovoked attack upon our defensive towers. The tower's alarms systems worked well and the 2nd Legion's 3rd Cohort\u00a0 was able to respond quickly, however without our general's orders. Two towers fell before our arrival, no survivors. We engaged the Orcish horde in a defensive nature, as they encroached upon our formation with crossbow fire. It did not impede their charge. After a few minutes of fighting it became clear that we could not win this direct confrontation without taking large casualties. Under the circumstances I took it upon myself to challenge the Orcish chieftain to a duel. The chief accepted and in a tough fight, was felled. Upon his death the Orcs retreated en mass. Troops were dispatched to ensure no stragglers\u00a0were harassing\u00a0the neighboring farms. With the confirmed retreat and securing of the southern border area, our forces returned to Isra leaving behind a temporary garrison in the sacked towers.\u00a0The injured and the dead, both Isran and Orcish, were properly returned to the city as protocol dictates.There numbers were as follows.\u00a0\u00a09 Isran injured of varying severity.\u00a027 Isran dead. 24 from the tower garrisons. 3 from the 2nd Legion, 3rd Cohort.\u00a023 Orcish dead.\u00a0In my personal opinion our defenses are highly inadequate to stand against raid attacks such as this one. A simple wall addition to the towers, and perhaps a nearby fortress could strengthen out southern defenses considerably by giving quicker aid and allowing the towers to survive a longer siege.John D.

Nothing of particular importance has yet come up today, and she\u2019s appreciative of that. No news is good news. Taking up the next bit of paper, it seems to be a correspondence of some sort.Exhalted Empress Naoki of the Isran Empire. We, the people of Libertalia, request an audience with the Isran leadership for diplomatic purposes. For too long have we stayed at arm\u2019s width, when both nations stand a chance to benefit one another. Since our nation\u2019s founding by Captain Francis O\u2019Malley forty years ago, we have watched from afar as the world has continued to grow around us, and we have been impressed with Isra\u2019s growth over the last twenty. We believe it is time to extend a hand to Isra and open our ports to your traders, so that we may both benefit from our very different nations.Libertalia recognises the reputation it and its people have gained among those on the open seas, one that may have rung true years ago; however, our nation and people are evolving beyond our original ill intentions as we bring ourselves into a modern era, an era with growing nations and endless opportunities, and we refuse to be left behind as many often do. We are no longer the band of pirates we once were, now we pride ourselves as a trade nation. Along with this letter, we have sent a gift to show our good intentions. Samples of spices from around the world, precious gemstones from the far south, and three barrels of Libertalian Ale, the finest on the open seas, all sold within our borders. We look forward to your invitation, and to expanding our relations with Isra and its people. Signed,Captain Joanne O\u2019MalleyThe Admiralty Council of Libertalia. By the time she\u2019s finished reading it, Naoki\u2019s eyebrows have nearly escaped her forehead; she doesn\u2019t know what to make of this. She\u2019s far from well-appraised as far as reputations on the high seas are concerned; her navy sails unchallenged as the largest and the finest; anything beyond that is below her notice. But if Naoki is reading this correctly, Captain O\u2019Malley here fancies herself the leader of \u2018Libertalia,\u2019 which she frames as a pirate den turned \u201ctrade nation.\u201d As such, she seeks a diplomatic audience with The Empress, such that they might negotiate some manner of a trade deal. Attached is a note from her staff that confirms that the letter did indeed come with the gifts outlined within.But without any further information, the credibility of this note seems rather suspect in Naoki\u2019s eyes. She is not at all attuned to gossip of the sea, and the names of neither Libertalia nor Captain O\u2019Malley have come across her desk in reports. And the tone she takes! Fluctuating between flattery, trying to pull the seniority card, and acknowledgment as a \u2018fellow\u2019 nation, it\u2019s difficult to discern what sort of position the Captain is trying to take. Shrugging internally, Naoki takes out a fresh sheet of parchment and begins her response.  Captain Joanne O\u2019Malley, If you would like to come to speak with me, please do. I can be found in The Citadel most weekdays, and usually meet with visitors in the afternoon.Nibbling on the end of her quill, Naoki considers what else could be said. There\u2019s nothing more she has to say or acknowledge.

It is one of our relatively far-flung provinces, down around not so far from Meridian. Self-governing, of course, but a part of The Empire nonetheless. A taxes-for-protection arrangement, mostly.\u201d\u201cYesterday,\u201d she continues, picking up a piece of parchment, \u201cI received this letter, which I will now read to you. It is addressed to me, from \u2018Lord Corbin Crema, son of Lord Bertrand Crema and heir to Castle Crema and its surrounding lands.\u2019 Which is to say, Darrie.\u201d\u201cHe-hem. \u2018Please allow me to get straight to the point, and forgive my bluntness: my father has passed. He had been ill for years, but had been rapidly declining for the past several weeks and I sat with him when he breathed his last. My stepmother, Iliana Crema, had taken on the responsibilities of the lord, ruling the castle and the villages as long as my father laid incapacitated. However, after his passing, the stewardship of the castle should fall on my shoulders, as is my birthright.\u2019\u201dThe Empress gives Helevisa a significant look. Provinces like these are permitted to keep all their laws, save for those that contradict Imperial Law. And Imperial Law does not speak on succession.\u201c\u2018Unfortunately,\u2019\u201d she continues reading, \u201c\u2018My stepmother refuses to admit to his death. She has kept his body in seclusion, letting nobody see it and preventing my dear father from resting in peace. She continues to preside over the lands, claiming that he is still alive, but merely ill. Please, Empress, I beg of you to send an official inspector to Castle Crema. Officially recognize my father's passing, certify my position as lord of the castle, and allow me to inter him in the family mausoleum alongside my mother. I cannot bear the thought of allowing him to rot away in that locked bedroom for a moment longer.\u2019 \u2026 And he\u2019s signed it, \u2018Yours faithfully, Lord Corbin Crema\u2019\u201dSetting the letter aside, The Empress looks to the Marchioness. \u201cHardly my favorite sort of mail to receive, but it is a manner that must be dealt with. I believe that you will be well suited to the task, so you will be traveling to Castle Crema to address this issue in my stead.\u201d \u201cHowever,\u201d she continues, raising one finger, \u201cThere is no assurance that any of this is fact, and it is not so easy as that to manipulate your Empress. It may be such that Corbin is a conniving bastard who aims to take advantage of Imperial power to steal the throne. It may be such that Lady Iliana is a witch, that Lord Bertrand is alive but imprisoned, or that there is no Corbin, and this all is an elaborate play to obtain a hostage for ransom.\u201dOne palm up, The Empress offers a small shrug. She doesn\u2019t know.\u201cYou are being sent by The Empress to investigate, and hereby have jurisdiction to do as you please within the context of your investigation. Lay your eyes on Lord Bertrand, unless he has already been interred. The Empress would like to see her vassal laid to rest with the appropriate level of respect, and the people of Castle Crema should see it done, by her order.\u201d\u201cIf Bertrand is indeed dead, his successor \u2014 whoever they may be \u2014 must come to swear fealty to me here in The Citadel. ... It is worth noting: I have no categorical issue with Iliana Crema assuming control of the castle, and you are not being sent for the purpose of enforcing Corbin\u2019s \u2018birthright.\u2019 The local law ought to apply, but above all, the next ruler of Castle Crema will be both competent and loyal to their Empress. If there is a dispute between Corbin and Iliana, I will hear the case here in The Citadel and be just in my judgment.\u201d\u201cIs all of that clear enough so far?\u201d Empress Naoki asks, one ear askew.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\u201cAh, Marchioness!\u201d The Empress sets her book aside and gestures for Helevisa to come sit in front of her desk. \u201cI have an assignment for you, though there\u2019s no hurry.\u201d"}, "post-94055": {"user": "Marchioness Helevisa Reinsel", "user_num": 3636, "timestamp": "1575751450000", "message": "Helevisa sat down when motioned to, twisting the ring on her finger as she listened to the  Empress\u2019 monologue.

The Empress nods, making note. \u201cAnd you survived.\u201dThis is stated as fact. The Empress looks at him over the desk and Simon swallows. Is he in trouble for that, or--\u201cI wish to hear about the attack,\u201d she continues. \u201cTell me about it. Take your time, and try not to sweat so much that it drips on the floor.\u201dThis prompts Simon to glow red with embarrassment and sweat even more heavily, but he launches into his story. \u201cWe were.. We were escorting the carriage, we always do, winding through the mountain passes, as you do\u2026\u201dThe Empress listens carefully, eyes and ears forward to follow the narrative as he tells it. Simon finds her scrutiny to be terribly uncomfortable but continues his tale. \u201c...And I said it didn\u2019t sound like no wolf, because I\u2019ve heard wolves and\u2026\u201d\u201c...and the bolts just bounced right off\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 and it bellowed: \u2019Surrender the gold!\u2019...\u201d\u00a0\u201c...then snapped it like it was a wee twig!\u201d\u00a0Simon goes on for some time but eventually comes to the end, \u201cAnd then it flapped a great big flap with its wings and took the entire carriage, horses and all!\u201d He pantomimes the flapping of wings for effect. The Empress murmurs acknowledgment. Putting a hand to her chin, she considers the matter. This is a new problem. In all her time, she has never heard of any green dragons in the Norkari mountains -- intelligent or otherwise. That means this one is either recently awoken or juvenile, and it didn\u2019t sound very juvenile.Lust for gold is common amongst dragons and requires no further explanation. But, she notes it was clever enough not only to selectively attack the tax carraige, but to attack on open ground, when the carriage was stopped, and do so at night, as to avoid Dawn Rider patrols. This attack was planned;\u00a0it would be fair to call it a heist, even.Taxes from the north only come in every quarter or so, on an irregular but not entirely unpredictable schedule. The next one won\u2019t be for a few months, so depending on how often the dragon feeds, it may or may not leave its cave for some time. Alternatively, it may grow bolder and strike out further. Taxes arrive in Isra from all of her territories, and they\u2019re all in more or less the same carriages. If it ventures any further out of the mountains it risks running into more patrols, but it would know that and plan accordingly. There\u2019s the matter of the endurance necessary to haul a carriage full of gold all the way back to the mountains from whatever road it is plucked from, but Naoki doesn\u2019t overthink it any further than that.This is a problem. A great big green, building-size, fire-breathing, heavily armored problem, that possesses human-like intelligence and also flies.\u201cHmmh.\u201d The Empress shifts in her chair to lean on the other side. Simon fidgets. \u201cOh!\u201d She remembers him and sits up. \u201cYes, yes, thank you Simon, that was very good. You serve The Empire well.\u201d He beams.\u201cYou\u2019re to take the next two weeks off and receive a bonus of, perhaps\u2026 250 gold. Remain in the city until further notice. Dismissed.\u201d She waves him away.Simon sputters his thanks, salutes, and makes for the door. With him gone, Naoki resumes her thought: a big green scaly problem...The first step is to post a notice. Something to the effect of \u201cA dragon has been sighted in the Norkari mountains. Travelers are advised not to travel north with large quantities of gold or other valuables.\u201d The people don\u2019t need to know that an entire carriage\u2019s worth of taxes were stolen, but perhaps such a notice will save some lives.The second step is increased patrols. More Dawn Riders near the mountains, especially at night, and watchtowers are to be on the lookout for shapes in the sky. Perhaps there\u2019s some manner of trinket or potion to see better in the night. Maybe she\u2019ll ask Daedalus about that at their meeting next week.The third step\u2026 The third step would usually be to hunt it. Hunting dragons is part of The Dawn Riders\u2019 heritage and there are dozens upon dozens of freelancers who have dedicated their lives to the pursuit. If she were to coordinate a focused, combined arms effort and leverage The Empire\u2019s full might, she could hunt down and kill this dragon, and potentially gain the riches of its hoard. She\u2019s been meaning to involve herself in more conflict and try out some of her new toys, and there are many who would enjoy such a hunt, herself potentially included.She could.But that would be effort, and that would be expensive. The lives of her people are infinitely more valuable than satiating bloodlust or flaunting her might. The dragon has not done enough to warrant such a response, and it would be poor form to send so many freelancers to their doom. (She still feels bad about the last time she did that.)No. Naoki shakes her head. If the dragon is so clever as all that and has decency enough to spare lives, she will attempt to liaise with it. The Fair Empress Naoki has a reputation to uphold and there is less to be lost in trying. If it won\u2019t negotiate, at least she will have tried. But how to do so...?

Thankfully, due to the height of The Citadel and the shot\u2019s level angle, there will be no mile-deep crater in Isra \u2014 only significant damage to The Citadel\u2019s walls. However, the incredible discharge of energy disrupts the time-trap, freeing those that remain. To them, it would seem the act of Naoki flipping off Pride erased the rotten bastard right down to the lower half of his boots. The Empress remains standing, a wicked grin on her face. The huge red gemstone is gone, replaced by an assortment of smaller ones held between her fingers. She isn\u2019t subtle about pressing more tiles with her foot, but this time the effects aren\u2019t as apparent. \u201cHaru is coming,\u201d she tells Alden, raising one hand toward Greed. \u201cThese two, then to your house, then the plaza for the last two.\u201dTo Torrin, \u201cThen deploy The Legion to retake the city.\u201d", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Empress Naoki squints, ears flattening.

Yet it spoke of such a potent and powerful malevolence that one might wonder if the voice making it had more in common with the formless entities of the void beyond the portal in the sky above the citadel than with humans. \"What did you think just because you cut off the legs of the serpent the plan would fall apart your eminence?\" The remains on the floor had caught fire, the robe burning away as it pushes what remains of its body up to look at her. The black skeleton that had lain underneath the robe until this moment now on full display as the obsidian mask drops from the bare grinning skull. The blast of the laser would have killed any living thing but Pride had been dead for a very long time, he had been dead since Alden had gutted him nearly eight years ago. But death was no excuse to stop conducting business. \"I figured you would have some kind of trap like that. Though I'll admit its efficacy was beyond what even I was prepared for.\"It didn't take a particularly large leap in logic to figure out just what this monster before her was. Pride was a lich, which meant that destroying his bones was more of an inconvenience than a debilitating blow. The skull looks over those gathered and he snorts. \"You can't escape your dilemma's so easily anymore your eminence. I was not here as a combatant, I was here as a distraction. Lust, Greed you have your orders. Capture the empress, get that crystal if you can kill anyone who gets in your way. But fight defensively.\" He adds a cruel chuckle entering his voice. \"With Alden here, I am not certain of your success but as long as you can delay him then we can secure the children. Envy and Gluttony are already entering his home it won't take them long.\"Then the skeleton collapses the bones falling apart as the animating force leaves the body. The obsidian mask explodes into splinters of razor-sharp glass. Lust doesn't hesitate he surges forward towards Torrin and his men. The royal guards had seen High Marshal Alden fight before and they knew that against an opponent of similar strength and speed their odds were slim.
