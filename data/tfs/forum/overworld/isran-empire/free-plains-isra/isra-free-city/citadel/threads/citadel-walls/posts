Looking over her shoulder to make sure no one could see her, she spread out her wings and flew quietly up to edge of the wall. The cloak billowed against her wings, but did little to impede her movement, and when she alighted on the wall, it closed back around her once again. Looking around, she decided to walk the length of the walls before anyone else. She turned left and began walking slowly, appraising the building's quality.After a quick patrol of the walls, which were very sturdily built, she took a moment to sit on the edge and appreciate the view of the plains from atop the fortifications. She would have sat there for longer, but what guards there were had begun to patrol the walls, and from what she gathered, they probably wouldn't appreciate her being there.

Artemis follows only a step behind, As they notice their unexpected visitor, the archers snap to attention, and attempt to pretend that they were paying attention before she arrived. Keeping watch, or whatever it is they\u2019re meant to be doing up on the walls. However, a dismissive hand gesture informs them- she\u2019s not here to inspect anything or receive salutes. That\u2019s what Ryden is for, she supposes. No, the purpose of her visit here is personal. Hands held behind her back, Naoki moves past the row of uneasy guards, and begins to meander along the fortifications. For as warm and high-ceilinged as her new office is, it\u2019s not quite the best environment for deep thinking. Or, at least, a change of scenery is sometimes beneficial, she supposes, internally justifying her escape.Having wandered a short way from the staircase, Naoki comes upon an open crenelle, and leans down into it, considering the city laid out before her. For a short while, she simply stands. Standing. Considering. Thinking. It isn\u2019t as if she didn\u2019t expect these sorts of thoughts. Related to responsibility and leadership and all that. Those are the sorts of things that are healthy to think about and consider rationally. It was the objective self-doubt that she wasn\u2019t expecting. Because, how is one supposed to justify Naoki as head of state? She has a bit more than ten years worth of life experience to draw on. That archer standing over near the stairs has double that, and then some! Wisdom comes with time. There is only so much one can absorb from books. Only raw knowledge, and that alone doesn\u2019t qualify an individual to make educated decisions. Well. Educated decisions, perhaps, but not necessarily wise decisions. All Naoki seems to be capable of is flying things by the seat of her metaphorical pants. Putting some marginal level of rational thought into how decisions will play out, and simply choosing the one that will most likely result in a state she is satisfied with. As of yet, there haven\u2019t been any additional, unforeseen circumstances that have thrown off this process. And as such, things have worked out so far. But as soon as something comes up. Some strange complication that throws one of these plans off kilter\u2026 Naoki shudders. A major misstep at this level would mean death. Perhaps not hers, but death all the same. Perhaps the portion that she finds most disturbing is that she would be prepared to accept responsibility for such a thing. Regardless, Naoki\u2019s introspection is interrupted; her earring glimmers in the sunlight as she receives a message. It seems as if someone calling themselves Emahra Untyrid  is at the gate, looking to meet with her. Assuming no trickery is afoot, that should be the strange elven woman from the previous night. Hm. Well. A bit of distraction never hurt anyone, Naoki supposes. That, and it should be interesting to obtain an understanding of the circumstances that apparently delivered the elf into Isra from some far off land. Perhaps she could be put to use, too. Naoki sends the order for Emahra to be sent up to the portion of the wall where she stands.

The news that Emahra hails from an entirely separate plane of existence is\u2026 quite an interesting tidbit of information indeed. Naoki has presumed that there was only long distance transportation involved, not inter-planar movement. To think that this elf, standing here speaking with her, was created and has spent the majority of her life in an entirely separate world\u2026 It\u2019s somewhat off putting. Somewhat scary, and humbling. Not only that, but she is living proof that other planes of existence exist, and travel is possible between them. The notion also spawns several sub-thoughts. For example, Naoki is able to understand Emahra with no difficulty. She has a touch of an accent, perhaps, but it would seem as if the spoken language is the same. As is etiquette. The concept of monarchy, being a heir, swords\u2026 The apparent similarities are present in each word. Are such concepts truly universal? Or are the circumstances that lead to their establishment in each respective plane simply that similar? The whole concept is worth deeper thought and further discussion at a later date, Naoki resolves. Regardless, here is yet another apparently incredibly talented individual come to offer their services. To be completely honest with herself, the frequency with which this happens to her is somewhat suspect to Naoki. There are presumably plenty of other individuals who would be able to make use of all of these people, and yet the seeming majority seek her out specifically. Perhaps there are greater forces at play, mandating this trend. Again regardless, here is yet another.

Absolute minimum, judging by the cleavage. Fifty years that involved probably not only high education, not only education tailored to statecraft, but also probably strong parental figures and suitable idols to attempt to emulate. Dead now, perhaps, victim of whatever war deposed Emahra to this place, but all the same. Watching that mop of blue hair fade down the stairwell, Naoki can\u2019t help but consider it with a touch of the greenest envy. This is a new flavor of envy, she supposes, but not an entirely new sort. As opposed to envy for those who have it better as far as lifestyle goes, this is envy for those who know what they\u2019re doing. Who think they know what they\u2019re doing, at least.

But at that point, Naoki\u2019s decision making process is already on its sixth iteration and is referencing the most basic of philosophical ideals to justify itself. Emahra\u2019s way is very much worth her envy, Naoki thinks. It would probably serve her well as a head of state, too. None of this internal conflict nonsense.A deep, rolling sigh is lost to the wind as Naoki turns back to the crenelations and opts to spend a while longer in aimless thought before getting back to thoughts that will have lasting repercussions on thousands of her citizens.

You\u2019re not prepared at all. You have no obligation to those two, no obligation to Votura, no obligation to me. If you accept this responsibility, it\u2019s going to be tough to put down. Ruling isn\u2019t all it\u2019s cracked up to be.

Taken by surprise the men do not even have time to scream before the thin blade of the naginata slips into the gap just under their helm tracing a thin line across their necks in a single smooth movement.Then he is off down the corridor the other two following on his heels. Lust was, like all members of The Set, an expert with his chosen weapon. Flowing like water around each group of guards they encounter. The Citadel guards that they ran into did not always die as easily as the first set. These were battle-hardened men, well trained, and with fine weapons and armour. But most of them came to the sword later in life and their training was harsh but reasonable and they had physical limitations. Against a group that had been trained like The Set, where the least brutal day of training involved starting the day with having a limb broken to learn how to fight with a handicap, and who were enhanced by magic? The guards could not stand for long. It took some time, and Greed and Pride had to move to intercept guards who tried to warn the empress they were coming, but they made it to her office. The person who had commissioned the set had their own eyes and ears within the palace and had confirmed this was where Naoki could be. \"Lead the way.\" Pride says to Greed as the last of her guards outside the office doors drop to the ground dead on the end of Lust's weapon.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"Time is not our alley and I doubt any guards remaining will be sufficient to stop us.\""}}
