Although he is not one to fret, he did find himself worrying a touch the following morning that his slip might cause him to be late, until Timothy, the Empress' loyal servant, had come to find the King himself.Timothy had led him and a pair of Dread Knight guardians back to the Citadel, though the guards at the Citadel gate were reluctant to allow the armed Dread Knights to enter. Ulfang, seeing no reason to fear the Citadel, sent them away, then, and went the rest of the way without escort, staying close behind the servant boy. On the way Ulfang found himself wondering on the usefulness of a servant that needs to eat and sleep. He probably even requires pay. He does seem quite proficient at his job, though he does nothing more effectively than a Revenant Steward might. Strange, the outside world's reliance upon the living for their menial labour. The Black Vale's way is far more efficient, by his reckoning.Lost in thought, he had nearly trampled the poor boy as he came to a halt before the Sudatorium and explained to Ulfang the protocol and etiquette of the place. Ulfang had thus entered the changing room and stripped unabashedly down to nothing before donning a towel wrap provided by the pageboy that was, decidedly, far too small -- though that's more an inevitability of his size rather than any fault of the servant -- and procuring a spare to lay below him so as not to sweat onto the wood.He ducks through the entrance into the Sudatorium proper shortly afterward, looking as comfortable in his own skin as he did in a suit of ceremonial armour the day previous. He is no less intimidating without proper armour or clothing, either; his fair, almost pale-skinned chest is broad and powerful and dusted with coarse white hair, he has a full set of taut abdominal muscles, and his biceps are about half again as thick as one of Naoki's bodacious thighs, firm as stone. His toned back speaks to a lifetime of heavy lifting and archery. His tree-trunk ropey legs are quite powerful as well, and ripple with every motion. His figure is not possessed of the lean, elegant and deliberate muscle of a nobleman, but rather it evokes the untamed power and savagery of a grizzly bear.His body below the neckline is yet further marred by battle and struggle than his face, with old nicks and gashes and tears criss-crossing his otherwise pristine figure. Most noticeably, a wide trio of thick, pink trails of scar tissue run from the center of his barrel chest to the right side of his lumbar region, apparently caused by the claws of some great beast. This looks the sort of barbaric man that would tear a girl like Naoki in half with his bare hands if given half the chance, and yet the graceful smile that crosses his features as his single good eye alights upon her belies his nobility.

The article only covers his flesh to about halfway down the thigh, leaving him barely decent, and this evokes a touch of irritation in him. It passes quickly, however, as few things are made for those with a drop of giant's blood, and Ulfang is no stranger to misfitted garments.\"The warmth of this place reminds me of the simmering hot springs of the Sable Bastion, one of the Ravenpeaks' tallest plateaus.

Pine forests make up most of the southern reaches, gradually giving way to an expanse of flat, fertile lands in the north before the River Reyk we call the Harvestlands, for that is where all of our food is grown.

My blood grants me mastery over death, but it grants me the ability to sense life as well, a talent which I have honed more precisely than my predecessors, as it has saved me from more than one assassination attempt. But my lady, I discovered a much more pleasant use for that power when I found this place. The vibrance of the life within those woodlands...it is nothing mere words can describe. I have found myself sitting within that clearing for days on end, simply enjoying the structured chaos of creation as it washes over me, through me, and I become one with the forest.

They're not fond of humans on the whole, though, and it's best to avoid them.\" \"So, too, can the titanic Ravenpeak Giants be found amongst the mountains, settled in primitive hunter-gatherer villages throughout the range. They do not possess our level of technology and magic is rare among their kind, but they stand at a height of about twenty fod, wield mauls larger than a man, and throw wooden javelins the length and width of pine trees. They are dangerous when roused, but the people of the Vale have a tenuous friendship with them. They allow my Revenant Cottiers to extract blackstone, precious gems, and metals from the depths, and their proximity helps keep Storm Dragons away. They hunt Storm Dragons ritualistically to appease their god, you see, and so the dragons tend to give them a wide berth unless angered. There are other beasts that roam the ranges regionally -- big cats, megaloceros, cockatrices, manticores, gryphons, etcetera -- but those two are by far the most widespread and prolific.\"Ulfang's eye rests back upon Naoki's, his face turned up into a content smile.

I was presented with the opportunity to assume management of a dingy little bar called \u2018The Midnight Sun\u2019, for reasons that remain unclear to me to this day.

It became a sort of a game to see how much gold I could make and how wide I could extend my influence. And what I found was that as I accumulated wealth and power, I was better able to provide for those fellow demihumans who found themselves much as I had. I inducted them into the organization, gave them jobs, gave them purpose, put clothes on their backs, fed them, and gave them a warm bed to sleep in -- all those things that were never given to me.\u201d\u201cI found all this to be immensely gratifying. It appeals to that base part of my psyche that compels humans to cooperate toward the greater good. I get off on receiving gratitude in that manner, and the associated luxuries were an excellent bonus.\u201d\u201cThe scope of those I took responsibility for continued to grow, as did my power to care for them. There was a point at which none in Isra could oppose me, and another where I effectively gained control of the city.

At that moment I became responsible for the lives of every man woman and child living in Isra, and I carry that duty to this day.\u201d\u201cSince then, I have dramatically increased both my power and the number of lives I take responsibility for, but my underlying motivations remain the same. Throughout my Empire, there are millions of Isran citizens who, whether they outwardly recognize and appreciate it or not, owe the very basis of their lives to me. They sleep soundly at night protected by the armies I raise. Their homes were built by the programs I organized. They bathe in the bathhouse I paid from my own pocket to construct, and I have even gone so far to provide food to those who have none.\u201d It goes on, but she doesn\u2019t.\u201cI have done good in this world,\u201d Naoki asserts, \u201cAnd I feel good about it.\u201d\u201cAt this point, it has become less of a choice and more of a compulsion, because I must continue to work as hard as I do to keep it all from falling apart, but I have become affectionate toward this Empire I\u2019ve built and these people I\u2019ve raised.

He wonders at that. It must be the steam, opening his pores and stimulating blood flow and such. Or perhaps it's just been far too long since he has last lain with a woman. He could likely bed any woman in the Vale upon request save perhaps his lieutenant, but he prefers a different approach than that. His preference is to sample and savour a woman's particular personality and flavour, like a connoisseur tasting fine wine, before partaking in the peak of her carnal pleasures. So why this reaction?He doesn't suspect for a moment that magic may be at play, and by the time he's once again focused enough to sense it, its signature residual buzz has subsided. Still, it has set off a chain reaction in his contact-starved body, and he finds his thoughts difficult to work through, harried consistently by a now-present undertone of physical yearning.\"Ah-hah,\" he coughs, a half embarrassed, half mirthfully amused grin crossing his features, \"my Empress, I do apologise. It seems your jest has affected me more than it should have!\"He has no shame in his body -- he is quite well-endowed, after all -- but even so there's a touch of embarrassment to be had when becoming so easily aroused in front of a fine woman, and royalty at that. Still, he supposes it's inevitable. The woman is a blasted monument to lust, after all. Every curve, every movement, every expression hints at it. What he wouldn't do to...But that line of thought is improper, and given Naoki's very light dosage of lust magic, he's able to rein his fantasies in and stow them away, although his gaze does finally drift below Naoki's neckline, trailing down to the exposed flesh of her voluptuous thighs, their smooth, supple, sweat-slicked flesh shimmering in the dim light of the Sudatorium. His heat-driven lewd inspection of her figure is finally overridden by his higher functions, and his gaze snaps back up to her eyes.

We went through plan after plan after plan, but every one we thought of was either too slow and would end with the Harenhalls captured by Maketh -- such as skirting the mountains to go around the harvestlands --  or would be overwhelmingly likely to end in both our deaths. But then, it hit me. In a fit of sleep-deprived insanity, a plan came to me. It was surely suicidal, but it was our only shot. Borog and I...we would ride a Storm Dragon.\"Pause for effect.\"We finally got some sleep and supper that night, and the next day we set out for the Ravenpeaks, to search the known territory of a massive Storm Dragon called 'Ranyaro', who the Giants had been trying to hunt for decades with little success.\"\"After two days of searching the craggy mountain passes and tracking the beast relentlessly, icecicles were beginning to form in my beard and Borog was on the verge of collapse. We were nearly out of will to continue.\"His tone becomes hushed, almost reverent.\"But then, a mass of thick, dark clouds passed overhead, and a great blizzard began abruptly. Darkness fell as quickly as if the sun had been blown out like a candle. We saw him then, the great beast, a black spot amongst the grey, barely visible through the whipping winds and swirling snow flurries.\"\"He dipped below the cloud cover for a moment, his silver-white scales shimmering as if struck by moonlight, great bursts of lightning following his path through the clouds like the wake beneath a ship. Naoki, let me tell you, he was a magnificent beast. So glorious was he that I nearly hesitated.\"\"But I knew what must be done. A great bolt of black magic formed within my hand and I threw it up into the sky. My aim was true, guided by the gods, and a thick black smog surrounded the beast, stealing the wind from below his wings and forcing him down to land before us. With a great, terrible roar like rolling thunder he faced us, electric blue eyes piercing our very souls with their enraged intensity.\"\"The beast must have stood at fifty fod at the shoulder, and longer than the towers of Harenhall were tall. Glorious, he was, and terrible. Borog brandished his great axe and I raised Fang, and we charged the beast, neither of us certain we could best the creature despite our dark powers.\"\"The fight lasted half the day. Wind whipped around us, lightning struck the ground near our feet, setting our ears to ringing. The beast took swipes with it's great razor sharp claws and blew blasts of impossibly cold air from its gaping maw that turned the earth to ice. But we were faster, and hour by hour we weakened the creature, taking swipes at gaps in its scales at every opportunity, barely evading its sweeping claws and whipping tail. The dragon nicked my back once, tearing through my armour like hot butter, but it only left a small wound. It's that shallow scar there,\" he reaches around to point to a light pink, jagged discoloration of his skin running along his lower back and wrapping about to his iliac region.\"We eventually exhausted Ranyaro to the point where he could not fight anymore, and thus began the much more difficult part of the plan: convincing a dragon to serve us.\"\"Surely we could have simply taken the dragon with a silver rope about its neck and bound it to our service, but as soon as we let it free it would have killed us. No, there was a more elegant solution to be had. Borog, you see, was a powerful diviner, a user of the mentalic arts. This allowed him to communicate with the dragon directly through his mind, as long as he kept physical contact. Borog touched his hand to the exhausted dragon's crown between four massive horns, and communed with the ancient beast for hours. I am still at a loss as to how he did it or what he said.

He leans forward a bit to give Naoki more room to operate and brushes his smooth, snow white hair aside to get it out of her way.Ulfang strokes his close cut beard slowly, regathering his thoughts. \"So, where was I...ah yes. There Ranyaro stood,\" he begins, \"head bowed to the ground to allow us access to step up onto his long, sinuous neck. Even with his accommodation, Borog and I had to boost one another to reach his crest, and neither of us were small men!\"\"That was the first time I had ever lain hands upon a Storm Dragon. Up close he was even more magnificent. His scales were warm to the touch, almost uncomfortably so, and felt as if electrically charged. As I sat upon his neck, just behind his titanic horns, he raised his head and I felt as if I could see the world for mil around if not for the maelstrom. Glorious creatures, truly splendiferous,\" enthuses Ulfang reverently.\"He took to the skies, then. I will not lie, it was a terrifying experience at first. The ground shrunk so suddenly that I felt as if I'd been flung from a catapult. It was not long before we had disappeared into the storm clouds and I could see nothing but grey in all directions, although despite the lightning that flashed all around and the violent wind that whipped about us, we were as the eye of a cyclone, untouched by the surrounding chaos.\"\"Borog and I had come up with an attack plan that Borog had then relayed to the dragon through their link: we would ride Ranyaro to the Crow's fortified peak and the dragon would tear it from its foundations stone by stone until there was nothing left. With the necromancer-giant exposed and a Storm Dragon to help us, we would destroy Maketh and bring an end to his tyranny. Our minds and wills set singularly on that goal, we flew north. Borog guided Ranyaro in the right direction, seeing through his eyes, those magical optics that pierced even the thick smog of the thunderheads, and their combined efforts made for a smooth and pleasantly uneventful journey.\"\"It would take a horse several days of running full tilt to reach the northern peaks from the reaches where we began, but on the back of the great dragon it took us less than two. We took only one rest-break, lasting but three hours, and it was an exhausting pace to keep. Not the least for the dragon, whose injuries, while relatively minor, were a draw on his body's strength. Still, we made it through, but not all was to go as planned.\"Ulfang pauses for a moment, rolling his shoulders and rumbling in pleasure as Naoki rubs a particularly tense spot from his back. He leans down to give Haru's belly a quick scratch, and then sits back up and clears his throat before starting back on the story.\"As we neared the southernmost border of the northern range, the dragon began to tire. It was not long before we were alighting back upon the ground in a most inopportune place: in an open field with no cover right before the towering Crow's Peak, overlooked by a great wedge-shaped ridge of stone. There a vast army of the dead awaited us. Ghouls, shamblers, ghasts, rotting abominations...they were like a sea before us. We were not to be able to lift off again, Borog informed me, and it was too late to turn tail; the army was already upon us. Borog and I stood shoulder to shoulder, with the great dragon stood behind, looming over us and the army. A thunderous roar rang out from the dragon's mouth, fangs the length of a man's leg bared at the advancing army. A wailing wind and cold, biting rain whipped about us. The army began their charge, and Borog and I raised our weapons to greet them with valourous cries of battle. And so began the legendary Battle of The Crow's Summit.\"\"We carved a bloody path through the scrambling mass of undead, and Fang delighted in their destruction. Borog was near as tall as me and just as strong, and his great battleaxe cut through those who I could not. There were so many. We wheeled about and dashed and tumbled to avoid the razor sharp, rending claws of the ghouls that leapt on us like snow leopards pouncing upon prey. We cut down massive swathes of rotting shamblers, but more always stood to take their place. Ranyaro's stormcalling saved us many a kill, great bolts of lightning crashing down to send clusters of the dead tumbling in all directions.\" \"Ranyaro was too large for the smaller creatures to even begin to trifle with, but the roiling flesh abominations, with their hundreds of bladed limbs and tentacles and guts the width of small houses provided more of a challenge, given their numbers. Ranyaro tore across the battlefield to engage them, creating a massive swath of desolated undead in his path, which we followed, grateful for the beast's assistance. Had it been only Borog and myself, we surely would have perished upon that battlefield, but with Ranyaro distracting the abominations and guarding our entire rear flank all his own, we could survive.\"\"After several minutes of fighting my armour was in tatters, the bladed claws of the ghouls and icy grasps of spectres rending it apart after repeated strikes. I received several of the scars you now see from that battle. Look here--\" Ulfang points to a long, deep-looking pair of scars that begin at the nape of his neck and end in the center of his back \"--here I was struck by a ghoul who somehow got behind me and leapt upon me, shoving me to the ground. Had Borog not noticed my plight and cloven the beast in two, I would surely have been executed then and there. A lesson in the fragility of life, I suppose. Thankfully, my ever trustworthy lieutenant was there to save me...but he could not save himself.\"Ulfang pauses for a moment, letting out a sad, wistful sigh. He collects himself with a slow intake of breath and begins again, planting his hand upon his knee and shaking his head side to side slowly.\"One of my greatest regrets. As he gave me his hand to help me up, he was charged from behind by one of the gigantic flesh abominations. I could have saved him, had I been a bit quicker, but before I could react or warn him, a long upward-curved blade of ivory attached to one of the abomination's disgusting rotted tentacles protruded from his belly and drew up his body, cleaving him in two from the waist up. It was a gruesome sight, and I was spattered with the blood of my brother in arms from head to toe. I could have saved him, but I did not, and his life was snuffed out in an eyeblink.\"\"Ranyaro went mad then. The dragon's pupils dilated as his neck whipped around to see Borog's collapsing corpse, and he let out a terrible sound the likes of which I cannot possibly do justice with mere words. It was like steel tearing, like an awesome lightning storm rolling over mountains, like the world itself shifting beneath you. I could feel it in my feet, as well, the trembling of an earth terrified of its own creation, and all was quiet for the space of a breath.\"\"In a whirlwind of activity, Ranyaro disemboweled fifteen of the abominations in a single swipe of his tail, and began rampaging through the battlefield. He was a force of nature when roused, a second wind inspired by rage allowing him to reach heights of power I had not seen even in my prolonged battle with the beast.\"\"It is then that Maketh himself appeared, standing tall upon the ridge of rock before his army dressed in cloaks of black that whipped about his body. It seemed then that all attention shifted to the dragon, and Maketh began conjuring a dark spell. That was to be my chance. I tore through the ranks of the undead with sword and spell, felling them like wheat beneath a scythe. With their attention off of me it was easy to wade through their tide, and I made quick progress as I closed the two hundred or so alen to the foot of the ridge. I could still hear the roars of the dragon, the thunderous explosions of lightning all around him, the cacophonous screeches of ghouls and spectres as they were disintegrated by Ranyaro's rage.\"\"I arrived before the ridge and began my long ascent, the handholds slippery with rain. It took what felt like a full hour. I was losing blood quickly and my strength was beginning to fail, but in one last push of will, I crested the side of the rocky ridge, but once again I was too late. I charged Maketh then, but the last word of his deathly incantation had been finished, and a great bolt of inky darkness descended from the skies and impaled Ranyaro through the back, cutting through his armoured scales like a hot knife through butter. Reddish-purple blood poured from a gaping hole in the dragon's chest as the lance of darkness vanished as if it had never been, and he stumbled forward, rocking with the pain of the strike.\"\"I do not know what spell Maketh used to accomplish this, but even his greatest dark power could not fully down the incensed dragon. Ranyaro slayed twenty more of the flesh abominations and countless more shamblers and ghouls before toppling down upon a group of them, finally succumbing to his injuries. Meanwhile, I was on Maketh, and I had caught him by surprise. With a sweep of Fang I tore into Maketh's hamstring and forced him onto a knee. He let out a hideous cry of pain and I leapt onto his back, running him through with Fang, the tip of my greatsword protruding from between his ribs and sending blood pouring over the edge of the ridge like a crimson fall.\"\"I fell to the ground from Maketh's back, then, and Maketh himself toppled from the ridge and fell several hundred fod to his death. I lay there, Fang still embedded within my enemy, disarmed and bloodied, as the storm clouds parted and the cries and groans of the undead began to fade. A ray of sunlight breached the stormclouds and fell upon Ranyaro's hulking remains, shining off them resplendently as I rolled my head to look over, as if the Gods themselves were blessing his passage with their light.\"\"I lost consciousness, then. I was found days later by the captain of my Dread Knights, who roused me with an essence transfer. I had been on the verge of death, so they say, and would have surely perished within the next few hours. I was incredibly lucky, so they told me. I was a hero, so they told me. But I reminded him of this: I am not the hero of this story. Borog, who saved my life in exchange for his own, is. Ranyaro, the great dragon who took on the army of the dead single-handedly and allowed me to approach its leader unnoticed, is. I am simply the wielder of the blade by which Maketh fell.\"\"The Vale had been ravaged by the Crow's undead army, and so I utilised my own army to help rebuild. It was a long process, but the reconstruction, and the story of how Maketh was defeated, helped immensely to return House Von Haren to the favour of the people. I have Borog the Strong entombed in the Crypt of Kings where the Von Haren monarchs themselves are usually kept after death, alongside a special chamber created specially for Ranyaro's immense body, united in death as they had been, however briefly, in life. They wait, there, to be called upon once again in the Vale's most dire time of need, but until then, they shall have their undisturbed, and much deserved, rest.\"Ulfang lets out a long breath and allows a period of solemn silence to fall upon the sauna, signaling the end of his story. He leans down again to scritch at Haru's belly, but says nothing, allowing Naoki to respond how she will.
