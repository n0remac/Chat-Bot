Formerly, guests and visitors found their lodging in the Keep Hall. A handful of individual fit in comfortably with the rest of the staff living out of the Keep, but this proved untenable for larger parties.As such, the Citadel commissioned a tavern, The Handmaiden\u2019s Basket, be built. In a move of deft speculation, Lucia de Kasbah and her husband Abdul el-Rahman, the former chefs working in the Keep Hall, requested to be posted within the tavern. Their deft sense of business and restaurant operations skyrocketed The Handmaiden\u2019s Basket to acclaim. Governmental officials have largely co-opted the dining room for their many meetings and celebrations, but the lodging remains the landing place for all outsiders who enter the Citadel. The location of the establishment provides easy access for the guards to keep close eyes on any and all travelers. A strict scheduling ledger, a massive vellum-bound affair, graces the front counter. It is this book that regulates what personnel from which office has what table at any given point. After several botched attempts to \u2018revise\u2019 or steal the book, it is now physically chained to the front desk, as well as charmed to prevent it from being removed from the property.The tavern is booked solid weeks in advance, with more senior officials constantly jockeying for the choicest of times to conduct business over pints of ale and rich, hearty food. Allegations of bribery, coercion, and collusion in relation to buying and selling reservations are taken only slightly seriously.

We have your preferred table selected for you Ambassador Iotapa. Right this way, if you please.\"The table, situated in the far right corner of the tavern proves a slight trek. Staff dance around each other and patrons, gracing each table with their orders, drinks, and a well-timed serviette or two as needed. The atmosphere is at once dignified and comfortable. A small stage opposite the grand hearth is empty, but a sign to the left advertises the rotating list of entertainment. Tonight there will be an up and coming singer-songwriter duo singing classical folk songs from the Far North.The students, having only heard of The Handmaiden's Basket as if it were a far-off country they might someday get to visit, gaze around hungrily. One man sitting at a centrally located position captures their attention for quite a few moments. He appears to be a laborer of some sort, sporting a tidy white neckerchief over a bright blue jerkin. He casts a few gazes over to the very corner of the tavern where sits an oil brush and can. Around him, his compatriots laugh and chat freely. Several students mentioned the term \u2018wall oiler,\u2019 prompting Iulia to smile.\u201cPardon me for one moment, if you would.\u201dIulia quickly strides over to the man and shakes his hand warmly. A signal given to an unseen member of the wait staff produces another round of ale to find its way to the table quickly. Iulia returns and launches into a quick explanation.\u201cThe Mason\u2019s Guild has a new hero today. He pulled off a marvelously tricky piece of work with an unwanted guest at the Citadel.\u201dMenus decorate the table. On each, there are exactly six items and six separate drinks listed. For every day, the menus change to reflect the available specials. Tonight, the theme is fish and seafood, freshly brought in from Port Silverion.Iulia orders first, selecting the Tilapia ceviche with Roma tomatoes and peppers and a white rum Mojito with guarapo, mango puree, garnished with a sprig of freshly picked mint.The students order next after some minor deliberation.The hostess turns her attention to Imisar and nods.\u201cI do realize that you might not eat in the same way that your average human may.
