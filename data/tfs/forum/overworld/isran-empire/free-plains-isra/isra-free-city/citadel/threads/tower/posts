It is, simply put, a crystal ball, a device attuned to divination and scrying magics, which can display visions of the future or show distant lands. At present, it shows a pair of dragons, one orange, one blue, flying above what would seem to be a somewhat mountainous region, and is, in reality, a portion of Central Meridian. The scryer operating the orb, a diminutive hooded Encalve mage of perhaps ninety, sits opposite Naoki, humming slightly as he maintains the image. Ringed around the table, warriors and officers of varying ranks and disciplines stand in a loose circle, having been summoned, but not having received any further instructions. Naoki, for her part, seems less than pleased. Her free hand rests on the arm of her chair, and the sound of her two fingers tapping seems to be the loudest noise in the room. Though it is partially obscured by her other hand, her expression is a scowl, as she stares at the dragon in the ball, unblinking. Though generally a rather compassionate and understanding sort, Naoki has not a smithereen of forgiveness for those who she believes to have wronged her, but especially those close to her. And this orange dragon, Trogdor, has done exactly that. Years ago, before Naoki possessed the means to do much about it, this dragon entered the city of Isra and happened across Kate Green. In the course of an interaction Naoki did not witness or receive the details about, he came quite close to harming Kate, and likely would have done so, if not for the timely intervention of a particular clothier and the subsequent efforts of Grandma, who was Isra\u2019s Head of the Justice Department at the time.After Grandma\u2019s very clear instructions not to return to Isra, the dragon did not, and though Naoki was quite upset at the time, she was willing to leave it be and go on living her life and such. But now, the dragon dares to return. Now, of all times, that it is well within Naoki\u2019s power to have it destroyed. Yet, it is associating with the blue one, Jarkoopi. Once a dubiously useful component of The Free City\u2019s government. Then a member of the Goraian regime. Now, he is an enemy of the state. His lair remains in Meridian, and he has slumbered within. It hasn\u2019t been viable to attack the dragon in its lair, and seeing as how he has not been bothering anyone, Naoki was willing to watch him slumber, and perhaps deal with him later.Now, according to reports from earlier in the day, the two are working together, and this does not bode well. As two male dragons, Naoki thinks it unlikely that their association is anything as benign as mating. (Not that she would mind or hold it against them if it were.) No, there must be something at play. Some manner of dragon business, a reason for the two to be cooperating, instead of fighting for the other\u2019s hoard. They aren\u2019t flying in the direction of Isra, or anything else of particular importance; there isn\u2019t any reason to waste lives in unnecessary conflict if all they\u2019re looking to do is leave. But regardless, this is cause enough to take other actions, preparatory measures. Naoki\u2019s earring begins to simmer in the dimly lit room as she issues instructions. Those standing around her start to disperse as they receive their orders, and before long, Naoki sits alone with the old mage, still drumming her fingers, scowling at the crystal ball.", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1694/post-first-merrimill-crossing?page=2", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/user/567", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/post/20235/thread", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/user/875", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/320/keep-hall?page=11&scrollTo=20591", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/user/102"], "image_list": [], "html": "Lady Naoki leans back in her seat, her chin resting in her palm as she observes the object on the table before her.

I am Freyja, Lady of the Moon, avatar to The Mother, and I am here to assist in any way I can. This force, this blight that we are dealing with today is called The Wyld. It is a consciousness of its own, locked away centuries ago by a coalition of brave souls which included myself and many of the mortals and immortals that walked the land during that time. Even now little is known of its origins, but The Mother has sent me visions from which I have gleaned some information.\"\"The Wyld does not wish for power, or domination. Rather, it sees sapient races as a disease to be wiped from the world without discrimination. It seeks to destroy organised society, plunge the world into a chaotic age of darkness wherein the only order is the natural order -- that is, predators feed on prey, the strong survive and the weak are weeded out without mercy. So, as you can imagine, there is no reasoning with this consciousness. I have been slumbering beneath the earth for a long time, so I am not privy to the advances that have been made since the cataclysm, but as far as I know, there is no way to destroy the Wyld through conventional combat. Nature magics simply bolster its strength. Fire can be used to beat it back temporarily but it will always overtake the flames eventually. Light magics hurt the Wyld as well, but even our most powerful magi could not destroy it in this way. The first time, by the time we were granted a way to defeat The Wyld, it was too late. The Cataclysm was already in motion, and the Wyld had done its part in causing that. But this time, we have caught it early. There is a way to win...\" Freyja pauses, as if for dramatic effect, although in truth she's looking over the conference to make certain everyone listens.\"The Mother, in those trying times, gathered Her strength and granted us a boon from the heavens. It is called the Stone of Sealing. It functions by tearing the veil that separates the material plane and what we called then the celestial plane, banishing its focused target to a place where it cannot escape...or so I had thought. I am uncertain how The Wyld breached the veil, but this is the only way of which I know to defeat this foe. It was stored away deep within the Moonlight Caverns eons ago, but its location is lost even to me. If we create a team of elite men and women to delve into those caverns, however, we may stand a chance at finding it. They will need to be powerful combatants; the Moonlight Caverns are filled with dangers large and small, visible and ethereal, even things not of this realm. The Mother considers it Her domain, but that will grant us little protection. The Mother sleeps; I have not heard Her voice in eons, and even since my awakening She has been silent. We will need to do this without Her intervention, this time.
