Any questions before we begin?\u201dFinally, as if the delusions of some weird shadowy man weren\u2019t enough, now there were humans! Again! Zhax was far from being in perfect shape, physically and mentally. But he wouldn\u2019t let down that easy! (Even if he was a bit bonkers, after all, he never was one with a strong willpower.)His head snapped over onto the inquisitor from his sitting position as he silently judged him with one yellow beady eye. He didn\u2019t like this guy\u2019s look, or attitude, so bland, just like his cell, and the spot of color on the roof, it was black and dark. He liked the color, not the attitude. Zhax turned his head to look back at the dark wall after the \u201cTapper of Metal Bars\u201d finished speaking to him. He was waiting for the shadow man\u2019s advice, should he ask questions? Should he cooperate? Were these questions and answers even going to mean anything? He didn\u2019t want to die but, death wasn\u2019t so bad after all, considering he\u2019d know about it from first hand experience.He glanced back at the inquisitor then looked back at the wall while he waited for shadow man to talk.\u201cCome on!... There\u2026\u201dHe listened to nothing, for a short moment before finally responding directly to the man.\u201cYeh, I\u2019ll help you out, it\u2019s what he\u2019s tellin\u2019 me to do, just get me outta here, just for a bit. I\u2019ve been sweet and quiet in this hole of mine, can I get a bigger hole when we come back? I really want a bigger hole. Not big enough to bury bodies in though, just big enough for me to move and kill a thing or two.
