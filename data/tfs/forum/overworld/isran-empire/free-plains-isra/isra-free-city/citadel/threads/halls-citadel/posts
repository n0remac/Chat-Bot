Some are furnished finley, with polished marble, padded seating, and exquisite candelabras. Others are simply carved stone passages, for moving from one room to the next.

In all the time since, the two gnomes had been hiding out in the Citadel, scampering through the corridors when there were no guards around, stealing scraps of food from the kitchens and sleeping in whatever nooks, crannies and closets they could find. Some of the closets had been quite comfortable, she had discovered one that contained folded up silken sheets that were likely destined for the empresses bedchambers. It had made a nice hidey hole for the gnomes until they had been forced to hide in there too long from some maids in the room outside and Lumpy had taken a dump in it. There were a billion other little places that gnomes could hide in though. Now, as Qelci poked her head out from a broom cupboard into one of the servants' staircases, carrying an armful of cheese rinds, she heard voices. They seemed to be singing seasonal songs. It could only mean one thing. She closed the door behind her again. \u201cLumpy!\u201d she hissed into the darkness. \u201cGuess what? Its Yuletide! That means \u2026 not only will they be cooking all the most delicious pies but all the big nobs like the fox-ear empress will be out on the streets watching a giant log getting burned, which means this is the perfect time for us to ransack the citadel!

Weeks? Months? Years? Maybe lifetimes? Ershadt could hardly remember what the sun looked like anymore since the empress had literally flushed him down the drains. It had been a fight to survive at first, the rats in the sewer-systems beneath the Citadel not giving their kingdom away freely - but after a long war they finally learned to respect Ershadt and now saw him as their mighty king. 'Ruler of Ratwood' was his newly given name - if the rats had spoken it or not or even consented to be his people using human words mattered not. It was a given and they had even kneaded a crown for Ershadt out of moss and some sort of long slimy fungi that grew down there. Well maybe he had kneaded it for himself, but nevertheless he was their mighty ruler and they were even practicing a new national anthem and one day... one glorious day they would march out and take the world above them by force! And then he would be emperor and she... SHE would be living in a sewer! Emperor Ershadt of The Overworld! Yes, he loved the sound of that - and so did his people always squeeking and egging him on in his quest to find a way out.It was one of his most trusted scouts that came with the news. \"W-what is it Greyfur? Did... did you say, that at one place the walls are so thing that you can hear voice through them?\" he asked enthusiastically. \"G-gather the army! We're taking the Overworld - and Isra will fall first! Speak to everyone and bring about the great news!\" Ershadt said almost jubilant as he would locate the place where Greyfur had told him the voices could be heard. Ershadt didn't hear them but then again Greyfur did hear a lot better than himself and as he started to dig away at the crevices around the bricks removing more and more until a few days later it seemed that only a thin layer of planks separated Ershadt and the final victory. Grabbing Fuzzyfur, Furryfuzz, Foxyfuzz, Furryfur and the rest of his generals and most trusted soldiers stuffing them into his pockets and holding them firmly in his arms he made a final onslaught on the wall barging through the thin wooden panel with his shoulder first and into... A closet.\"For the Glory of The Fuzzy Eeeempiiiireeee!!!\" Ershadt shouted as he crashed through the backpanel of the closet the rats squirming around in every direction biting whoever was in their way out of confusion and stress. \"Yesss..! Show them who's their new ruler my trusted elite troops!\" he called out victoriously as he lay inside the closet but started to notice that the shadows around him might be... quite familiar indeed.

The incident. Qelci's hushed words of Yuletide festivities woke him up from his light nap. For just a moment, Lumpy might have been overjoyed at the prospect of finally making off with their payday, but he didn't quite have enough time to ramp up his happiness before Ershadt came tumbling through the wall on top of him. Instantly Lumpy was covered in squeaking, scratching, biting rodents, and he pushed Ershadt and the rubble from the wall off of him and leapt to his feet. Lumpy swore, swiping and flailing to get the rats off of him, before finally delivering a kick to whoever had just crashed through the wall on top of him. He belt down, and grabbed the figure's shirt with both hands. With the very dim light coming in under the door of the closet, it took Lumpy only a moment to figure out it was their third lost gnome compatriot.\"Ershadt!\" Lumpy said in surprise. \"Kuh-Kuh-Qelci!
