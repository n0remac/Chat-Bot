However, its existence is something of a secret, shared amongst a small group of naturally-inclined, like-minded individuals who have befriended the gardeners. They often use it as a quiet place to eat lunch, gathering around noontime when the sun shines directly down from above. They sit in small groups at the tables, sharing light conversation before returning to their duties.Overlooking the courtyard are a number of windows belonging to The Empress\u2019s Chambers.

Another hand landed on her own, clenching tightly.When she looked up, Naoki, Alden the courtyard... it all disappeared, replaced by her: a woman with cheeks so pink they were tulips, and a smile so mesmerizing that it stopped time.

She stared at Kauri with eyes that reflected the turquoise waters below.\"My sister, Collette, and I decided to go on an adventure. We had braved mountains and forests in the past, but we had such wild, romantic thoughts about the sea. Rumors about Paradise was spreading around, though no one really believed it. Naturally, we took it upon ourselves to find it.\"\"Collete was pregnant, so she couldn't strain herself trying to handle the boat. I certainly couldn't do it myself, so, somehow, we were able to inspire a round up a few people to help us. We had quite the motley crew\u00a0comprised of a fae called Bora, a halfling caster by the name of Ilvey, and our elven captain, Clovis.\"\"We never expected to find it as quickly as we did. It laid itself out before us after a week of sailing, sun shining, sands gleaming, and so much fruit hanging off of the trees that the branches were bending! Goodness, it wasn't giving us any reason to sail away. Then we got closer and... and then suddenly a storm happened. There hadn't been a cloud in a sky but in an instant, the sky was dark and the waves began to knock the boat about. I lost my balance, hit my head and blacked out.

Ilvey\u00a0was the one that saved us from drowning, but she used up so much energy she wasn't able to make it, herself. Bora dragged Colette and I to shore, the only survivors. The villagers found us shortly after and took care of us until we were able to recover. We soon realized that it wasn't going to be an easy thing to leave, but we had come to the island to explore, so it wasn't a huge priority just yet. The villagers were a good start. We got so many answers to all our questions! But it wasn't enough. There was still so much that they didn't know that we just had to find out.\"\"Colette and I ventured far until she got tired, which happened sooner and sooner each day. Eventually, we began to notice little things changing about our bodies. Stripes were surfacing on her skin, and my eyes started to become yellow. We didn't care for this much, as the villagers told us that it was going to happen. No, what concerned me most was that Colette was getting so much more tired every day. Eventually... eventually she... she just... didn't wake up.\"The chimera tore her gaze away again, staring solemnly at a small, grey body. It was like looking at ashes of a raging wildfire. Somewhere within the debris, however, she found a dim ember.\"Somehow, we were able to save the baby. She was born a chimera, quite like the one I am now. I became her guardian and rarely left the village from that moment on. I eventually became a game warden for them, making sure the oxen we used for food didn't veer into other territories, or that another threat wasn't wiping them out. Things ran relatively smoothly for a while... until the attacks. I woke up and so many of the children were gone, including Poala. There was so much blood, so many bodies...\" Kauri shook her head, trying to shake the memory out of her mind.\"I looked for days to find the culprit, but that did nothing. We weren't able to do it on our own, and I'd known that from the beginning, so... so I prayed to the island, and asked for it to let me leave. I didn't think it would work but it did. That's when I met the Marshal and where that story starts.\"The pale woman was somber after her story. She had never told the story in full before.

It seems like she\u2019s hit a sore spot, though she didn\u2019t intend to. If it turned out that Selene was a member of some royal or prestigious family, that would be worth noting. Similarly, if she had a husband or children, that might turn out to be a bit of an issue for them.\u201cThere are many I consider as family, but in the legal sense of the word I have only Princess Skarlet.\u201dFollowing this, The Empress leans back to think. She\u2019s almost out of questions, Selene is getting bored, and she hasn\u2019t yet reached a conclusion on her suitability as a consort.Because on the one hand, if it works out, if she is loyal, Selene would make for a superb consort, perhaps more. She is competent, attractive, and if she is to be taken at her word, a good lover. She would likely bear children with excellent traits. Naoki isn\u2019t looking for much more than that. However, though she says she is \"tossing her card in the hat,\" though she offers to be arm candy, her intelligence shines through; Selene is Smart. Smart, with enough ambition to have achieved her current status. Becoming The Empress\u2019s consort would be an excellent way to grow her power further. Her aspirations aren\u2019t clear, but \u201cthe throne\u201d is a common one. The means and motive for betrayal are there. But more than anything, she reminds Naoki of herself, in that though Selene would be an excellent screw, it would probably be Naoki getting screwed in the end. To accept Selene as a consort would be a high risk, high reward decision, and it\u2019s not one Naoki is going to make right now. Not until she\u2019s seen more of the options. To this end, The Empress nods and says, \u201cThat will do for now. You\u2019ve made a good impression; the duration of your pass will be extended, and you will hear from me in the future.

Though she wasn\u2019t enthusiastic about the idea of choosing a successor at first, the idea of all this being someone else\u2019s problem is appealing. The more days that go by, the better the old days look in retrospect. Naoki didn\u2019t appreciate Emahra as much as she should have at the time\u2014a ready-made successor delivered literally to her doorstep the first night of her reign. It was supremely useful to have such a competent right-hand woman and to be able to delegate tasks of importance to her comfortably. Emahra is likely happier back home than she would be here, but Isra is worse off for it.Naoki sighs and removes something from her eye. Then, it occurs to her. She can\u2019t do anything about Emahra, but you know who she can replace, is Fornillian. After consuming so much lust it became impractical for him to remain in The Overworld, so he returned to The Circle of Lust. That was years ago; it\u2019s been far too long since Naoki was on the receiving end of some good tentacles. The same ritual should work again, and there are probably plenty of spare tentacle beasts lying around down there, doing whatever it is they do in their spare time. Theoretically, it would be easy to just... ask for another. A plan formed, Naoki smiles to herself. Getting pounded insensate should help take her mind off things.
