It's an absolute pleasure to have you all tonight as we open the first meeting of the Conclave, the first governmental body of its type, at least as far as I know. I can promise you that the existence of this revolutionary body will ensure that the most efficient and sensible choices are made for Isra, removed as we are from the bureaucracy of the Assembly. I have absolute faith that everybody present can put politicking aside in the name of acting in the best interest of these lands.\"\"After all, that is why we are here. Very, very few of us are career politicians by nature - among us we have necromancers, warriors, lycanthropes, and farmers, but to name a few - and it is this concept of diversity that gives us strength as a body, compared to the Assembly. We know how to cater to the best interests of this city, because as a collective, we know what it is like to exist in each and every part of it. From those of us who were born with titles to our name, to those of us who were born with no more than a few pennies, we have lived on every part of the spectrum.

I do, I have a matter to bring up.\u201dShe takes another half-moment to coalesce her thoughts, and form her primary train of thought for the small speech she\u2019s about to deliver. Presently, she begins, \u201cI have a man. Mr. Juan C. Ruben. One of Isra\u2019s more senior citizens. He\u2019s not a very charming man, speaking frankly. He\u2019s a bit of an addict, and that\u2019s an understatement. However, he is a brilliant architect, as well as a former Aaedanian.\u201dShe pauses for a moment, primarily out of respect for Aaedan, but continues shortly thereafter, her tempo increasing with each word, \u201cAs I was visiting The Sun the other day, he staggers down the steps and approaches me, one lense of his spectacles shattered, hair every which way, and smelling strongly of twenty different chemicals. He says to me, \u201cMa\u2019am, ma\u2019am, ma\u2019am, look. Loooook.\u201d Naoki\u2019s substantial talents of impersonation allow her to mimic the man\u2019s tone with an almost surreal degree of accuracy. The voice doesn\u2019t fit her at all, but seems almost effortless as she breaks it off abruptly and continues in her own speaking voice, \u201cAnd he proceeds to dump into my hands a crate, filled to overflowing with scrolls like these,\u201d she gestures to the scrolls sitting before her. There are five of them, rolled in a little pile, seemingly identical, each bound by a small red ribbon.\u201cThe undead are coming, ma\u2019am. They\u2019re coming. Comin- *hic* Coming to kill us allllllll\u2026\u201d and he reached over and snatched some poor woman\u2019s drink, downing it in a single go before continuing, \u201cThe walllllls. They\u2019re not e'nnugh! We need moah walls!\u201dShe even goes so far as to emulate the hiccup in the man\u2019s speech, lurching in her seat and gesticulating as he did to add a level of pantomime to her impersonation. \u201cAnd then he passed out on the floor, stone cold.\u201d With that said, Naoki proceeds to slide off one of the ribbons and unroll one of the scrolls, spreading it on the table before her. It depicts a building that seems strikingly similar to The Citadel, but significantly larger, and with heavier fortifications. Despite the apparent madness of their author, the plans themselves are immaculate, each line perfect to the point of seeming unnatural. \u201cHe\u2019s completed seven crates of iterations so far these so far, depicting The Citadel- both expanded upon and rebuilt, the city walls, watchtowers, outposts, forts, and probably other things too. I haven\u2019t looked through them all yet. Midnight is a powerful drug. He\u2019s probably revised his designs another crate\u2019s worth since I spoke with him this afternoon. And though I will be the first to admit that dear Mr. Ruben is stark raving mad, he does raise a point that I have deemed worthy of consideration. There are threats in this world. The recent catastrophe in Aaedan has established that. And while taller walls may not have helped in that instance, they most definitely would in others. Isra\u2019s fortifications- both of military installations and the city in general, are not all they could be. Not all we could make them to be.\u201d\u201cSome things are easy, such as replacing old guard-towers and seeing that the fortifications we already have are well maintained, and supplemented with the correct enchantments. I\u2019m not referring to those things. Such things ought to be considered standard. I\u2019d like to consider the notion of undertaking a larger project. I\u2019d like to consider the prospect of getting very serious with our static defenses, expanding the civilian, military and industrial-logistical infrastructure, and turning Isra into a fortress-city.\u201d As she speaks, she unrolls another scroll. Rather than the technical schematic of the previous scroll, this is more of an artistic rendition. It depicts the city of Isra from above and to one side, as if one is flying. The level of detail is incredible- each visible building is entirely accurate and depicted faithfully. A keen eye would be able to easily pick out such landmarks as The Ctiadel, The Midnight Sun, and other such landmarks. How he manages to do the shingles is anyone\u2019s guess. However, the most prominent features are the walls. Great, black things, stretching what would seem to be perhaps\u2026 a hundred? Two hundred meters up into the air? It\u2019s hard to say, the sense of scale is skewed. Regardless, massive walls, arranged in a pentagon around the city, broken at regular intervals by towers and topped with all manner of step-layered crenelations. It is truly a sight to behold, and after raising for all to see, she slides it along with the first scroll to the center of the table, to be viewed more closely by any who might choose to, either for practical reasons or ones of artistic appreciation. \u201cMy personal opinion is such that an operation of the scale I intend to describe will take years, and that we ought to start sooner rather than later. The treasury is in a fine state to support such a venture over the course of a few years, and in addition to the primary benefit of having the walls once they\u2019re done, building the walls will also serve to bolster the economy, creating a demand for jobs. Laborers, builders, supervisors, as well as all of the support staff involved in obtaining the materials and bringing them to where they need to be. I am in favor of the project, with the caveat that it be done carefully, properly, and not excessively quickly. I would like to bring this matter to the table, and hear any strong opinions held on it.\u201dWith that said, Lady Naoki slides back into her seat, finished speaking.

It took a moment more for her to perfect the idea in her mind. Finally the volkrim opened her mouth to speak, a suprisingly smooth and soft voice leaving her lips, \"Cyronin is right. The high walls and towers alone could stunt the city's growth and make her seem uninviting, this can be overcome however.\" She waited a moment giving people time to shift their attention to her. \"The project should go above and beyond the walls, as they are but one layer of defense against forces marching on the city. I think we would have to continue construction projects throughout the city afterwards with Naoki's proposed goal in mind... With the aid of magic and a few good engineers it is more than possible to make Isra a mountain on the plains; creating a tiered city. Multiple platforms overlapping each other, sepperated by gates and each tier having its own walls and defenses; such as high mounted trebuchets. It would truly turn Isra into a fortress city.\" The idea would surely be scrutinized but she continued, stopping only for breaths but speaking slowly and calmly to make sure that all heard proper,\" This solves Cyronin's problem with the city looking intimidating as if done correctly, we could make the city look both aesthetically beautiful and safe to merchants and immigrants alike. It also solves some issues that could arise from building such defenses... It gives the workers on the walls continued work after the project is completed. It doubles, perhaps even triples the available space behind the walls. And, in my opinion, most importantly it gives us the chance to repair, update, and in some cases build necessary infrastructure throughout the entire city.\" She paused letting her words sink in before continuing, \"That being said, it is perhaps an issue to discuss at a later date, the issue at hand is the walls. These wall are the first step in producing a stronger Isra that can stand the tests of time and war.\" Akai'a let it rest at that point.

The practical value of walls is undeniable. Unassailability is a wonderful trait to have, and that fact cannot be argued.

Such a sumptuous point to make. The thought brings a small crease to Naoki\u2019s brow, but she otherwise dismisses her irritation as Akai'a begins to speak. As she continues, Naoki begins to nod. An expansion upon the idea of simply walls. An engineering project on an even more monumental scale, to include expansions to infrastructure and introduce the concept of layered construction. Technically, Naoki supposes that it isn\u2019t quite the most practical idea. Given the size of the Free Plains, and how staggeringly much land exists in a state conducive to building, it would be far cheaper to build outward. Wide, not tall. But there is, again, the idealism of \u2018a mountain upon the plains\u2019. A tower stretching up to the clouds is more romantically appealing than cityscape sprawling all across the countryside.

His incredulous reaction to Naoki's proposal would be, he hoped, the only one of such nature during the meeting, but he very quickly and very painfully was proved wrong when Akai'a added to the proposal, with the far-fetched idea of raising a literal mountain from below Isra, seemingly without any regard to the structural integrity of the land, the potential risk to the existing buildings and persons of the city, the incredible\u00a0cost of hiring enough powerful mages to work such a feat, and the potentially immense ramifications it could have on the flora and fauna of the surrounding region.

I do enjoy working with all of you and would like to keep our relationships intact and free from scandal.\u201dZemp extinguishes his pipe and leans forward in his chair. From the topmost pocket of his waistcoat, he takes out a small pair of halfmoon spectacles and rests them on the end of his nose. Once everyone has their own bundle of papers, he begins.  \u201cTo begin, please refer to the first page of your papers. We have recently added the territory formerly controlled by the Gorian Regime to our own holdings. Medan, now called the Grand Duchy of Meridian by request of its new regent, is in the process of being fully admitted to our state. The newly titled Duchess Camilla Blake will preside over this holding. She will serve as leader during the time Isra works to help piece the land back together. Her service will continue so long as she decides to hold this position. I need not tell you the toll that the war took on both the infrastructure and people therein. The chief goal on our end is to support the Duchess in her rebuilding efforts, namely in providing capital for construction and infrastructure projects. More information can be found in your papers, or from anyone serving on the reconstruction commission.\u201dA few sympathetic nods acknowledge this reality while papers rustle and shuffle. \u201cThis council will receive updates as reconstruction efforts progress. The current plan is to have a task force report back to us here. With foreign affairs being my particular skillset, I would not be the one to ask for further developments on this front. We will all be hearing more details on this front from Lady Naoki as this meeting progresses. The naming of officials to this task force will be taken up at another one of these meetings.\u201d\u201cPage seventeen holds our next order of business.\u201d Zemp gives the council a few seconds to turn to this page before continuing.\u201cCompared to the matter of Meridian's reconstruction, this is a far more comprehensive issue. The scope of what is to come, and I do not mean to overstate this, will be rather daunting at first. In an effort to consolidate our various departments from The Conclave, Isra, and the fledgling Meridian government, all current agencies, departments, and divisions are to be restructured.\u201dMurmurs and whispered conversations briefly interrupt Zemp, causing him to glare over his small glasses around the table. One stateswoman pipes up, saying \u201cMr Convenor, a question for the current speaker.\u201d\u201cI will not yield the floor to any questions just yet, Mr Convenor.\u201d Zemp replies, \u201cAllow me to finish, then we will see if any questions remain. All agencies will be reformatted under a new banner, which is a purely stylistic change. Everyone will keep their current positions for the time being, I assure you, but you will have new faces in your departments as we onboard officials from Medan and other sundry places. Again, no one is being replaced. If you are uncomfortable with this aspect of the proposal, we can take it up after the briefing.\u201dAnother pause, this time as a page offers a small slip of paper to Zemp. He unfolds it under the table and skims its content.\u201cCorrect. No one will be losing their current position, but there will be a few title changes reflecting our reorganization. The biggest of these will be officially changing the name of The Free States. With our growing import in the world, as well as all our new territorial holdings, it makes little sense to continue to call ourselves simply The Free States, not when we have become so much more. We will be seeing a resolution to rename our happy little country from High Lady Naoki and her commision today, as well as a resolution to create these new titles.\u201dOut again comes the pipe and tobacco pouch while Zemp finishes his speech.\u201cAnd that is all I have for our briefing today Mr Convenor. With that, I yield the floor to questions.\u201d", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "After the formal introductions and commencement of the meeting, Chancellor Ryden turns to Josef Zemp and nods."}, "post-67573": {"user": null, "user_num": null, "timestamp": "1495421273000", "message": "Fairuz was content to chat quietly with Ganymede Galaii as the Minister took up her position right next to Grandma.

No, what made him feel especially uncomfortable was Zemp's role in the whole fiasco, and the rapidity with which it had occurred.

After all, if she lacked faith and trust in him, how could he expect to be able to discharge his duties with the necessary authority and freedom from oversight?However, that was a matter that would have to be resolved as and when any formal changes were cemented and decisions were made for the future of the city and the Free States.

It was a young nation, a very young nation. It would be unwise to grow complacent, to become satisfied with what they had already achieved. That was how weakness spread throughout a nation. So far Isra had been mostly spared the ravages of war, only a few events truly striking directly at its heart. Save for Goraia, Isra had managed to absorb several other nations without bloodshed. Isra needed to continue growing, but it was naive to assume their string bloodless conquest would continue on forever.These were the thoughts that had been troubling Grandma for some time, an irritation buzzing around in the back of her mind.
