The other portions of the room, including the floor, are made of a dark, finely carved and polished wood. Doors lead off this main hall to the left and right, while a staircase is present directly ahead. A grand set of double doors sit at the landing, and the stairs branch off to either side and lead up to balconies overlooking the entrance. On these upper platforms, doors mirror the ones below, and from either end, still more doors are present, leading off into rooms unknown.  From the foyer, the first door on the left leads into what is titled above, \u201cThe Lounge.\u201d The Lounge is a somewhat small and unique shaped room and is furnished similarly to the entryway. Shelves have been built into the walls, and upon them sit books, scrolls, small sculptures, and a small assortment of trinkets. At the far end of the room, a table stands upon an elegant rug, and two cushioned seats sit facing the windows. Through the windows, a courtyard is visible, in which there is a wide variety of flora.

It\u2019s good to be the king, but it\u2019s also stressful, and tiring to be the king. The weight of the free world has been feeling especially heavy as of late, with the ever-present issue of succession, Vortua\u2019s new Duke, suspicions that assassins may be at work, and The Ball tomorrow night. It's a lot for one Empress to worry about. After being a potato for a short while, Naoki sits up and begins undoing the ties on her sandals. It\u2019s times like these that lend easily to self-reflection, but she\u2019s really just not feeling it tonight. Instead, Naoki opens the drawer of her bedside table and moves a book aside to retrieve a folded piece of paper. The edges are frayed from handling, and in places drops of water have smeared the ink. Holding it up to the light, Naoki reads it again.Naoki turns it over to continue reading.By the time she\u2019s finished reading, Naoki\u2019s hands are shaking. Setting the note aside, she rests her head in her hands and does her best to keep it together.How many times has she read that letter, and it never gets any easier. A year and a half have passed, but time hasn\u2019t healed the wound. One year, six months, and five days, or 550 days in total, if you\u2019re counting \u2014 and Naoki is. 550 days, and it still hurts just as much as the first.The question plagues her: What could it possibly be that\u2019s been evading Kate for more than a year, that wouldn\u2019t be more easily found by all the resources of Isra, and is more important than she is?It\u2019s probably some damn plant, and the idea of that led to Naoki having the decorative plants moved from her office, just because looking at them for too long would upset her. They say that\u2019s better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all. But is it better to have loved and been left for some stupid plant, than to have never loved at all? Naoki wonders. Because it certainly would be nice not to have this loneliness, sleeping alone every night. Not to feel this anger, for having been left in the first place, or this frustration, for not being able to do anything about it. It\u2019s especially frustrating for Naoki, The Empress, Unquestioned and All-Powerful Ruler of The Free World. With all her legions, all her wealth, all her mages, and her allies in places both high and low, none of it can do anything to bring Kate back.Because she could find Kate \u2014 that\u2019s the second frustrating part.

Our children could transfer their own life to save their dying kin, or use the strength of enemy soldiers to turn the tide of a losing battle. A siege could be held indefinitely, and a siege defence would be made doubly potent by the ability of the Emperor or Empress to raise fallen men on a whim. They could enhance their living soldiers to the point where they would be considered super-human, and drinking of the blood of a Von Haren imparts some of its power -- as can be seen in my Dread Knights -- that they may use it upon the battlefield. Not only this, but my plan is very clear in specifying that you are guaranteed an heir. The firstborn will be yours, regardless of the child's gender.

You offer great power, but the power you offer is dark, profane, entirely at odds with the sensibilities of my Empire, and unnecessary on top of that power I already have.\u201d\u201cRegardless of your qualities, intentions, or what \u2018could be\u2019, the fact remains that your Dark Arts are exactly that, and reviled throughout the land. The people of Isra would not accept a Haren ruler in the same way they accept me. Scaring them into submission or ruling through fear is entirely unacceptable, and I ought to be proof enough that the ruler of Isra does not need that manner of personal power in any case.

Until now it had not occured to Ulfang that the people of Isra were unaware of Naoki's dealings with darkness, but her words make it blatantly clear. The question is: should he speak his mind on this, or hold his tongue? He has angered the woman once already, but...He decides to take the middle road.

Could she be a witch? Could Naoki have a Coven of Diviners of her own? Or, perhaps this old hag hides something greater behind her wrinkled skin. On further recollection, it seems that this woman hasn't aged any further than Naoki since he first looked upon her visage through his mind's eye. Could the two be connected in some way more profound than the eye can comprehend?\"Who...are you?\" he inquires, lowering his fists, although his attitude remains guarded.

He fancies himself her equal, and, not having refuted him, she supposes that she has made it so. At least as far as their conversations go.But what a discussion. It was only halfway through that Naoki realized that it reminded her of another, similar discussion she had with Archbishop Alured Norian, in the very same Sudatorium that she will be seeing Ulfang in tomorrow. Alured proposed to her a scheme along similar lines, where, posing as a solution to her \u201c\u201c\u201cproblem\u201d\u201d\u201d of not having yet chosen a sire for her children, he could do her that immense favor that surely no one else would be so incredibly kind as to do, and, in so doing, piggyback off her success and power to further his own aims. In that case, he was focused less on the child and more on the ramifications. It was an anti-undead, religious sort of thing, where he hoped to change Isra to impact his ideals upon the world. It was, somehow, more disagreeable than anything Ulfang brought up, due mostly to how keen he was on wiping Isra clean of the undead. That sort of low-key-genocide doesn't sit well with her, even if they weren't necessarily alive to begin with. Lots of Naoki\u2019s best friends are undead, so there was good cause to issue with his plan. She heard him out, entertained his proposal, but then when Naoki brought up Skarlet, he stormed out in a big huff and hasn\u2019t been heard from since.Now that she comes to think of it, the comparison between Alured and Ulfang is an interesting one. Both crusty old men at least three times her age looking to impregnate her and take advantage of her power. Both six-letter names beginning with a vowel followed by the letter L. Both with strong and strange opinions on the topic of death. Both quite tall, and rather intimidating. But Ulfang is muscly where Alured was lean. Alured styled himself as creepy but ultimately benevolent, but in reality had nefarious intentions. Whereas Ulfang outwardly appears not just creepy but downright evil, though it seems as though he has pure intentions at heart.Hmmh. Naoki sighs, and sips her wine.Still. It\u2019s a troublesome problem, the whole thing. Surrounded on all sides by people who want her to change for their benefit. Suitors, trying to wed her. Opportunists, trying to breed her, and others, maneuvering even now to position themselves favorably to take advantage of the power vacuum when/if she dies. And The Set, actively plotting to make it a 'when' in the near future. Even and especially: Grandma, pressuring her to Ascend and become immortal.After considering the matter for several moments, Naoki comes to the conclusion that it certainly would be fantastic if everyone could just piss off.Again, she sips her wine.And throughout it all, none to confide in. None to lean on in troubling times like these, and none that would be suitable to discuss her troubles. Those that Naoki can trust to support her have dwindled down to a paltry few, and even then they are far off, tending to their own matters. \u2026 It is during times like these, Naoki thinks, that she most misses Kate. What she had with Kate was pure and untainted in a way that Naoki doubts she will ever have again, especially considering recent events. She can relate to Ulfang and his dead wife, and sometimes Naoki wonders if...No! Catching herself, Naoki abruptly stands and stalks over to the window, her ears flattened in anger. Now is not the time for crying and self-pity. Now is the time to figure out what the hell she is going to do to sort out this flaming mess that her life has become. She will be forced to make a decision about succession eventually, and she must figure it out before that point....Scowling at the black feather sitting so arrogantly on her window, she huffs again and crosses her arms.

It would be easier and probably safer just to divest her of the anklet and send her on her way without so much as a glance from The Empress, but curiosity bade Naoki to see for herself. That was a few hours ago. And upon seeing her there in the cell, in such a sorry state, it was a combination of pity, loneliness, and common decency that compelled Naoki to recognize and tend to her. Now, or rather, in a few minutes, she is to meet with Andrea, and speak with her for the first time. Some words were exchanged in the prison, but this will be their first discussion, as kin.Standing there by the window, Naoki puts one hand to her stomach as she gradually becomes aware of a strange feeling.

How the hell did someone like her end up with so much? On the other hand, she\u2019s the only one she\u2019d met who is much like her, so who knows what had happened to the others, or what they had become. At this point? Probably dead. Strangely enough, Andrea considered herself one of the lucky ones. Still, she enters the chamber wearing a white, button up blouse with only a handful done from her waist up, leaving the top relatively open, and a pair of blue breeches, held up by a rather nice, but basic, looking belt. Andrea didn\u2019t much care for it, but the entourage had been rather insistent and she didn\u2019t really have much time to explore all her options. She\u2019d have to get the name of the tailor though, she could get used to being caressed by such fabrics instead of the cheap stuff she had been able to afford. Although now she\u2019d be lucky to afford a potato sack. The best part of her outfit, Andrea figured, is the thick socks and boots she had picked out. They were the first things she went for, before even picking out underwear, and in retrospect she figures she must have looked rather silly standing bare-arsed in only a pair of socks and boots, but damn it were they comfortable and warm. When you\u2019ve spend months trudging through the snow with one holey shoe and the other foot being bare, you grow to appreciate such things. For the first time in however long she\u2019s clean. Not a smudge or a spec of dust on her body, and the rosy glow had come back to her cheeks. Even her numerous freckles seem to have grown darker along with her olive skin, and her hair is freshly cut and brushed, no longer twisted, knotted, or matted in strange, gross ways. Her hair only went down to her chin, but it waved beautifully, a true testament to the royal barbers. Or the guy they had hired off the street to deal with that mess, but whoever it was they did a hell of a job.

Well soooorry, Your Highness. Where Lanne\u2019s from, pages are only found in books, and that\u2019s even if they\u2019re all there. She\u2019s read plenty of books where she\u2019s had to skip a few pages and just make up what happened in between. It kinda sucked being poor. \u201cRight,\u201d she says with a curt nod. \u201cBest of the best at procuring stuff. Gotcha.\u201d Her eyes suddenly go cross-eyed when she\u2019s booped, forcing her to scrunch her nose with a sniff. Whether or not its intentional will be her little secret, but it certainly brings a smile to her face. \u201cWell yeah, I\u2019m not some loser bumpkin who doesn\u2019t know manners. Its not like I spent all my time in bars getting hammered, I\u2019ve had to sweet talk my way through things plenty.\u201d Then she puts her hands on her hips. \u201cOh, and trust me, I know what its like to be the one handling food. Worked as a bar wench and waitress from time to time, and spit in food plenty of times. Assholes get what assholes deserve, eh?\u201d she asks, looking a little proud of herself. \u201cBut I get your point. Bring the hammer down with a smile.\u201d Andrea chuckles to herself as she follows her sister into the long hall she\u2019d come from. On her way down, she had barely enough time to admire the woodwork, let alone wonder what was behind the door. The escorts around here, and she means that literally, certainly don\u2019t wait around when the Empress wants something. Maybe that iron fist stuff worked? \u201cYour pages, your money, your invoices,\u201d she says, glad she could finally say \u2018invoices\u2019 in its actual sense for once. She looks to Naoki and smirks at that last bit. \u201cYeah, it would uh\u2026 be real weird if we shared the same courtesan. I know we\u2019ve only just met, but being sisters and all, yeesh.\u201d She knew the thought of that might excite some, but not her. \u201cAnd psh, I know they\u2019re people just like you and me, just less powerful,\u201d she says, pointing to Naoki, \u201cAnd less roguishly beautiful.\u201d Then to herself with a wide grin. \u201cBut, uh\u2026 I guess I\u2019ll get my own one or two or something?\u201d she asks, her grin morphing into a slightly quizzical look. \u201cNever really been able to afford one before. Got any suggestions?\u201d She raises her hands to cut Naoki off for just a second. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t mean to ask from your own experience like you have a little black book of hookers, I know you ain\u2019t like that. At least, not publically. I just mean from what you\u2019ve heard through the grapevine. Might be nice to have someone at my beck and call for that sorta thing instead of hanging out at a bar hoping for mr. handsome or lady luscious to walk in.\u201d Though she isn\u2019t likely to stop doing that. \"Maybe someone who can double as a... I dunno. Butler? Or do you have a separate one already that will work for me? Do I have to get my own there too? Can I?\" After Naoki finishes with the list, Andrea commits it to memory. \u201cLounge, latrine, guest baths, guest rooms, pages, tea rom, library - it\u2019ll be nice to have actual, full, not-falling-apart books for once, escape tun- escape tunnel?\u201d She looks at Naoki for a brief second and blinks. Wait, of course she\u2019d have an escape tunnel. How else would she get out of a raid or something? Barely gets use, she\u2019s sure. She won\u2019t have to use it... Naw, she won\u2019t have to use it. She shakes her head with wide eyes, then continues to follow along. \u201cUnoccupied. Gotcha. Guess one label will be mine?\u201d She walks forward and opens one of the rooms as Naoki describes them, then stops in her tracks with a muffled gasp as she places a hand over her mouth. Her eyes are gleaming and the size of dinner plates as she looks around the ornate bedroom. From the large bed with plush sheets, the bookcases (albeit largely empty for now), the expert woodwork on the furniture, and even a small fireplace. All for her? There\u2019s so much room to fill it with stuff! Stuff she could finally afford! Oh man, what would she get though? Books! Art! A liquor cabinet! Some instruments - oh how she\u2019s always wanted a violin! Could she play it though? Probably, didn\u2019t take her more than a day to play a lute well. One of her many talents is music, after all, unnaturally so. Her ears swivel and her tail flicks and swishes behind her, brushing parts of her breeches as it swings wildly. \u201cThis is\u2026\u201d she begins. \u201cThis is bigger than the biggest apartment I\u2019ve ever lived in,\u201d she manages before feeling the lump in her throat. \u201cDon\u2019t like them? Sister, these\u2026 I would be happy with a clean wooden crate, this is\u2026\u201d She can\u2019t finish her sentence as the overwhelmed tears begin streaking down her face again. Unfortunately for her, the mascara the wardrobe department had forced on her prior to meeting the empress had begun to run. Stupid makeup, she insisted she didn\u2019t need it, what did they know? The moment is so overwhelming, she doesn't even ask where her own bathroom is, all she knows is that the guests have their own. Before Naoki could say anything, however, she\u2019s caught in another tight sisterly hug. For a skinny, malnourished broad, Andrea still had enough strength to make it just that tiny bit uncomfortably tight without the taller sister realizing it. All she felt was the warmth of her newfound, far too generous sister. They say money can\u2019t buy love, but it can certainly make that love more obvious.
