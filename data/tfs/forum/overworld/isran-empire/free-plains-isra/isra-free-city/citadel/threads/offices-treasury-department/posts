This must be the place...Madame Naoki examines the plaque, noting its disrepair. Cautiously, she pushes the door inward, and peers inside. She is greeted by darkness. The room before her is pitch black, save for the block of light allowed in through the open door. Fumbling around in her pouch, Naoki selects a gem. A small orb of citrine. Holding it aloft between two fingers, she activates it. Piercing light radiates outward from the gem, instantly illuminating the room. Holding the gem such so that the palm of her hand is between her eyes and the glowing orb, she advances into the room, gazing around at its contents.Dusty shelves filled with scrolls line every wall of the room, and more loose paperwork litters every available surface. Tomes stacked upon chairs, crates of scrolls piled in the corners, bound stacks of documents littered across the tables. No evidence of regular  inhabitants or recent visitors is obvious, it seems as if the room is simply a dumping ground for any financial paperwork The Citadel happens across. \u201cIt\u2019s less busy than I thought it might be\u2026\u201d Naoki makes a dry understatement to the empty room, referring to the obvious absence of any employees or treasury workers, or indeed, any evidence of human interaction with the room, beyond the dumped paperwork.But wait. There, on the single desk situated in the middle of the room, atop a ledger, another piece of paper, with a short, handwritten message scrawled across it. Naoki plucks the note from its dusty perch, and reads it. Good luck.She scowls, and places the note back down. Apparently whoever had previously been assigned to managing Isra\u2019s finances had given up, perhaps overwhelmed by the sheer size of the task. She wanders over to one of the bookcases, and holds the gem up to examine its contents. After a solid five minutes of careful examination, she is unable to discern any sort of pattern or organization structure to the documents on the bookshelf, other than they all seem to be more than six months old, and the objects are all stacked in a very space-efficient manner. Spotting a familiar seal on one of the scrolls, she carefully pulls it out, causing a minor disturbance within the stack as the other scrolls tumble down to fill its place. Taking the scroll back over to the desk in the center of the room, she locates a half burned candle, and places the gemstone in the depression, allowing the candlestick to serve as a stand for her light source. Turning back to the scroll, she undoes the sun-symbol wax seal, and unrolls the scroll across the collage of papers on the desk. If the seal, sealed by her own signet ring wasn\u2019t enough confirmation, the document reveals its identity as last year\u2019s tax paperwork, witten in her own hand, and delivered personally to the Citadel gates just under a year ago. Apparently never, up until this point, even so much as skimmed by any treasury worker. Madame Naoki sighs deeply, fully realizing the task ahead of her. She had always assumed that Isra\u2019s success  had someone behind it all. Some little office of qualified and diligent financial experts, working away quietly to manage the nation\u2019s budget. But apparently, no such organization exists! Or perhaps there was, up until recently - or perhaps not so recently, judging by the dust on, well, everything. How does the country even function? She tries to imagine The Midnight Sun operating without her work on the finances, every first Tuesday of each month. She can\u2019t do it. The business would collapse in a matter of weeks as problems run unchecked and salaries go unpaid. Who even pays the city guards? The military, or the ministers? Apparently nobody is managing the money! With a small grunt, she lifts a stack of tomes off the singular, worn seat, and places them on the floor. Taking the seat herself, she lets fly another long sigh, beginning to consider how to best rectify this\u2026 situation. It\u2019s very much a \u2018situation\u2019, she thinks. Was Ildesias even aware of this? Did she seem like a miracle worker to him?As the beginnings of a plan begin to take shape, Naoki reaches across the desk, and grasps the note. Pulling it over to sit before her, she takes another look at its message, mentally thanks the author, and turns it over. Within the desk, she locates some rudimentary writing implements, and begins to record, on the back of the note, the steps she would need to take to save the city.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "A plaque on the door, tilted slightly to one side, reads \u2018Treasury Offices\u2019.

I- we- the Treasury Department, have a lot of responsibilities; including, but not limited to, trade regulation, taxes, the finances of the government, funding the armies, the possible creation of a national currency, the handling of government documents, such as citizenship and immigration papers, and dealing with other groups and nations to establish government sanctioned trade routes.

They are fairly standard documents of employment, and ask such questions as name, date of birth, place of residence, those standard sorts of questions.

He smiled and nodded.\"My apologies, yes, I have had the honor of going to The Midnight Eclipse before with my family, however, I enjoy The Midnight Sun slightly more.

All that needs to be done is for me to have a few people sign off on these papers, which I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be willing to do swiftly. And yes, I own The Midnight Sun, and its sister establishment, The Moonlight Eclipse. I own and manage both establishments and the organization of the same name.\u201dShe holds up her left hand, displaying the back of her palm, and the signet ring on her finger. There is but a single ring bearing The Midnight Sun\u2019s symbol, and Naoki regularly uses it to stamp documents and seals as a mark of authenticity in lieu of a signature. It is also a mark of her leadership, similar to how dukes and lords sometimes wear signet rings for the same purposes. Obviously, instead of a duchy or dominion, Madame Naoki instead controls an empire of the business variety.\u201cAs for the cat stuff, let me just go ahead and address this now. I have these ears, and this tail. Both features are fully functional and quite fuzzy. You can have a closer look if you\u2019d like, and I'm not opposed to the concept of some petting at a later date, but they are -as near as anyone can tell- essentially physical features that you might usually find on a housecat, except they\u2019re on me, and I\u2019m not a housecat. As you\u2019ve obviously noticed by this point, I have holes tailored into my clothing to allow my tail to swing freely.\u201dTurning about to face away from Poros, Naoki bends over slightly, waving her backside slightly to display the mentioned hole. It is a small, hemmed hole in her skirt, just above the waist, from which her tail protrudes. If Poros could see her face, he would be witness to the smirkiest of smirks; she is enjoying herself, toying with him in this way.\u201cI also don\u2019t generally wear hats, as they tend to interfere with my ears in a rather uncomfortable way. I don\u2019t have any fangs, whiskers, or any other cat-features beyond the ears and tail.\u201dTo showcase this, she stands upright once again, approaches Poros, and flashes her best smile, even going so far as to wink as she does so. Indeed, there aren\u2019t any fangs in her mouth, simply regular, well-cared-for teeth, and no whiskers are visible on her cheeks. Before anyone gets any ideas, she moves back, and seamlessly transitions into answering his business query, tone swiftly shifting to match the more serious topic. \u201cThe very first thing we\u2019re going to be doing is sorting this all out.\u201dRaising her hands, she gestures to the mounds of paperwork that surround them. \u201cThis is the accumulated financial documentation of Isra over the four years of its existence. We need to sort through it, categorize, and organize it all into a way that makes it useable for us. The government owes some people money, and is itself owed money by the people. We need to obtain all of the information we can from these documents, and create a functional understanding of what we have to work with. Who owes who what, and the true state of the nation\u2019s economy as it stands before we begin the bulk of our work.\u201dWalking over to take her bag from the pile near the door, she places it on the desk, and continues to speak as she peers into it, ensuring she has everything she needs.\u201cFrom there, the next thing we should do is create a system- a series of connected systems, for keeping track of information within the Department here. We\u2019re going to be collecting and processing a massive amount of data, and it would be nice not to have to do it all by hand. To help with this, I think that we might go and approach the mages of The Conjunction, and ask them to assist us by creating some magical artifacts and devices for our use. There are all sorts of things that talented magical practitioners and artificers can do to a book and quill and it would be very convenient for us to have magical ledgers that sort themselves onto shelves, and quills that write of their own volition.\u201dTaking the near pile of completed documents, Naoki carefully tucks them into the bag, still speaking.\u201cNext, after we\u2019re finished establishing ourselves, we will need to go and collect the information we don\u2019t have. We don\u2019t know how many people, exactly, live in the city, what their holdings are, or what they should be paying in taxes. This makes it impossible to accurately tax anything. So we\u2019re going to do a massive census of the whole city. Go around, figure out what everyone has, and record it in our ledger.\u201d\u201cThen, we\u2019d cooperate with Ildesias and the Assembly to create some reasonable tax codes approved by the rest of the government. The ones we\u2019re currently operating under are very vague and don\u2019t take a lot of things into account that I think they should. There\u2019s a lot of leniency in collection, and nobody really checks to see if everyone is paying the correct amount. A complete reform of the tax system is required,  so we\u2019re going to do that. Also budgets. The government is currently operating without a budget of any sort. That needs to change as soon as possible, and it\u2019s our job to do that.\u201dIt's evident, as she continues, that she's put a lot of thought into this, and is vocalizing plans she had conceived previously. \u201cBeyond that, there are also a lot of smaller and side projects I\u2019d like to work on, like reformatting and expanding upon the citizenship process, creating trade pacts with other nations, and instituting beneficial economic policies, but those sorts of things will have to wait until we\u2019ve gotten the Treasury Department into a reasonable state, and until we have time to do them. I realize that this seems all like a very daunting task- and don\u2019t misunderstand me, it most definitely is, but we\u2019re going to do it, and make it work. It\u2019s going to take a while, and it\u2019s going to be difficult, but I\u2019m going to see it done to a satisfactory level of completions, and am happy to have your assistance in doing so.\u201dMadame Naoki nods to Poros, an indication of respect.\u201cNow, unless you have anything else you\u2019d like to mention before we depart, let\u2019s do so and be on our way. There\u2019s a lot to do, so we should get started, starting with finding you a place to live. Like I mentioned, I own a lot of property around the city, and I have a few places in mind you might find suitable.

The meandering hallways and walkways to the treasury department were like a maze to Kargth. Although at several times they exited into the outdoors as they passed balconies or pathways Kargth could never get a clear bearing of where he was. He would need a guide to leave this place as much as he would to enter it, he mused. When they eventually made it to the treasury department itself and he was told he was to meet with their queen instead of the leader of trade, Kargth regretted not bringing Cyrene along to help with his speaking. All those thoughts left him when he gazed upon the queen herself after being ushered in by the small child. A soft woman faced him, sitting behind a stack of books which she half-heartily tried to push out of her way. She had the look of a person use to a lavish life-style, her eyes said otherwise though. He would have to speak carefully with this one. He looked at the chair she offered him and after a moment of thought, spoke. His voice deep with the tell-tale slight echo. \u201cI would rather stand.\u201d He took up position a respectable distance away from her and began to speak, choosing his word carefully and with great concentration.\u201cI come from a land far to your north.

It was used as a safe\u2026path for transport of\u2026illegal things. The people who lived there\u2026corrupt or too scared to\u2026act.\u201d He looked around the room, observing the luxurious furniture. \u201cWe do not\u2026have much. What was worth money, was taken long ago. Since my\u2026arrival I was able to\u2026 build a small\u2026 militia of volunteers and we have\u2026removed most of the\u2026 bandits from the land. I wish to\u2026 rebuild the people.\u201d Kargths paused, correcting himself.  \u201cMy apologies, rebuild the lands. Our forest\u2026contains strange trees. The soil rich and\u201d Kargth struggled to find the word, looking at his hands as he tries to remember, \u201cdifferent.\u201d They trees are\u2026dozens of men tall.

A lot of what she said was true, life was hard in the Forgotten Forest as the locals called it, a self-deprecating joke in a way. \u201cThe main village of the area is home to a small\u2026 port, and fish is taken from the main river that flows through the \u2026valley which helps support the hunting and foraging. Grain was purchased at an\u2026 exurbanite rate from the bandits in the area, as a way for them to control the towns.  Without the bandits there, \u201cKargth shrugged. \u201cThe access is greatly \u2026 decreased, for the moment we can make do, but come winter, which is harsh, I do not know. Kargth continued to explain, showing a bleak outlook on the current situation.\u201cThe reason why we had to go through the \u2026mountain pass other than by boat is simply there is not enough local \u2026 craftsmen to build the barges. As well as the presence of smugglers and slavers that use the river. We are forced to use the mountain path for now until they can be \u2026 removed. Quite simply \u2026 Empress, we\u2019re too poor to do the easy way.\u201d He paused to let the last sentence settle in the room before continuing.\u201cAs far as processing the wood is \u2026 concerned. Teams of five or six men work to fell the tree, it can take almost a whole day to do so. It is worked like stone, it is more \u2026 fibrous of course. But most \u2026 debarking is done by hammer and chisel not by saw. In a way it is more like mason work then woodwork. The villages use it for many\u2026 different purposes, as the frames for houses that are almost \u2026 inflammable. Support structures for water work, as it can take many years for \u2026rot to set in. \u201cKargth looked at the previously offered chair. \u201cEven furniture that could hold \u2026immense weights unlike normal woods. In \u2026 essence it has many of the qualities of stone but it does not take away \u2026 heat, does not require \u2026 dangerous mining and also can be dyed and treated, slower yes, but gives the same affects as any other wood.\u201d", "link_list": ["/post/89891/thread", "/user/607"], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/jxxfhPa.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@madamenaoki\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/89891/thread\" timestamp=\"1556786392\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-607\" title=\"Empress Naoki\"><img alt=\"Empress Naoki Avatar\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/jxxfhPa.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/89891/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1556786392000\" title=\"May 2, 2019 0:39:52 GMT -8\">May 2, 2019 0:39:52 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-607 group-0\" href=\"/user/607\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@madamenaoki\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Empress Naoki</span></a></span> said:</div>\u201cHmmh.\u201d A huge amnesiac in full plate has come to sell her strange trees. \u2026 It isn't the most bizarre thing to happen this week.<br><br/>\u201cFair enough,\u201d The Empress waves a hand. \u201cThere are some I understand, is why I ask.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cIn any case, if you\u2019ve brought some of these strong trees with you, you must have brought them through the mountain pass...\u201d She trails off, considering. <br/><br/>\u201cYou\u2019ve experienced the difficulty involved with moving material goods through the mountains firsthand, and considering that, I\u2019m unsure if this would be a good deal for you,\u201d she muses. \u201cBut you probably don\u2019t have but so many options.

Her eyes flit up and down the parchment she\u2019s scanning, deep in thought. At one point, there was theoretically some manner of reason as to how things were arranged, but that was some hours ago and things have since devolved. On the desk before her now is a mess of scrolls, ledgers, miscellaneous documents, and bits of scrap parchment covered in varying numbers of numbers. Because today is Gold Day, and The Empress has spent the better part of the morning reviewing The Empire\u2019s aggregate financial records from the last quarter. Earlier there was a break for brunch, but now she\u2019s back it, reviewing, tabulating, analyzing, and making sure all of the numbers add up in the way she\u2019d like them to.Managing the finances of the entire Empire is a herculean task, and arguably not one The Empress Herself should be burdened with. Though the Treasury Department\u2019s staff handles much of the tedium, The Empress has refused to appoint a Treasurer or delegate the task to someone like Robert, insisting on doing it herself. Because way back when, once upon a time, Madame Naoki was The Free City\u2019s Treasurer \u2014 and The Empress is not so foolish as to relinquish the purse strings she herself pulled to gain control of the state. Gold is society\u2019s lifeblood; controlling how the gold flows in The Empire is to control The Empire itself \u2014 Gold is the essence of power. To appoint a Treasurer \u2014 even a trustworthy one, would be to cede much of her power as Empress and make a coup that much more plausible.No, The Empress balances the books herself and likes it that way. Right now, that means reviewing The Enclave\u2019s proposed budget. It\u2019s four times what it was last year, and she suspects that to be a bit egregious, even considering their recent restructuring.As she is considering the bulk purchase of alchemical reagents, Naoki\u2019s ears perk at the sound of footsteps in the hallway. She removes her spectacles, and when the pageboy knocks, she bids he enter.His message: \u201cKeph is here.\u201dNaoki\u2019s eyebrows rise in surprise; she wasn\u2019t sure if Keph would return or not. He certainly has the very best of reasons to, but Naoki admits she may have gone the slightest bit beyond what might be considered reasonable during their last meeting, and she wouldn\u2019t have blamed him for fleeing Isra as soon as he could walk straight. The fact that Keph has returned is very interesting indeed \u2014 a pleasant surprise.The fact that he is here now is less immediately pleasing; she\u2019s right in the middle of this. She has no reservations about having him wait like any other guest, but this will take the rest of the day. Empress or no, that\u2019s colder than Naoki would like to be toward Keph. The rest of the work will keep until tomorrow, but she at least needs to finish what she's doing.After a moment more of consideration, The Empress decides. \u201cBring him here, would you?\u201dThe pageboy blinks once before nodding. \u201cYes, milady.\u201d It is unusual that she would receive a guest in such a place, but then Keph is not a usual sort of guest.After the pageboy leaves, Naoki replaces her spectacles and picks up where she left off... with a request for fifty barrels of pixie dust.
