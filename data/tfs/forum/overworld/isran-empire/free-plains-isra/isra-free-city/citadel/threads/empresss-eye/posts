A thin layer of glass was all that prevented someone from stumbling into one of the several blazing infernos that lit the room. Despite the numerous fires, the room proved to be entirely smoke-free. Standing in stark contrast to the floor, the walls were entirely constructed of an ivory colored marble that glistened in the light of the open flames. Golden symbols that were reminiscent of runes adorned the walls, forming various abstract patterns.Move a bit deeper into the chambers and Iulia would find a half circle of steps that spanned the entire width of the room, resulting in half of it being elevated. Dead center in the elevated half of the room was a desk of mahogany. Taking up the same space as three average sized desks, several stacks of paper, a bundle of scrolls, and a few quills rested on it. By now, it was likely Iulia had managed to hear the sound of running water over, a bit quieter than the roar of the flames but present nonetheless.The source of this water would become clear to Iulia as soon as she turned her attention to the wall opposite her. A bit more than halfway up the wall were a pair of fountainheads. The fountainhead to the left was the head of a sheep, while the one to the right was the head of a wolf, both were fashioned or at the very least plated entirely in gold. The thought was likely to come to Iulia that this entire room was nothing more than an extravagant display. After all, who needed an office so big when it had only a single desk in it? Why was it lit with pillars of fire as opposed to the far less unobtrusive lighting magic used in the rest of the citadel?After a few moments of pondering the rooms impractical and extravagant design, Iulia would likely take notice of the figure sitting behind the desk. Given the sheer scale of the room, the figure behind the desk was almost an afterthought. No one had entered the room with Iulia and the doors behind her had already been shut. The distant figure behind the desk didn\u2019t address Iulia in any way.Assuming Investigator Iulia took an action appropriate of her station and moved towards the figure, Iulia was likely to recognize who had called her here.

There were measures for conducting communication between both the offices of Investigation and of Surveillance, and these did not include issuing summons for a rank and file Investigator to be asked to give an informal report to an administrative official within a separate office. There was clearly some reason for circumventing the usual channels. Iulia bristled internally at the breach of protocol, but held her tongue. To the Vizier, Iulia simply met her gaze and nodded. \u201cYour words are kind, Vizier. I simply do my job and seem to have proven quite good at it. So long as my efforts help bring justice to Isra and her people, I am content.\u201dNow, to tackle the core thrust of this meeting. The Vizier had an angle here, but Iulia could not envision what it was she wanted. Surveillance should have sent for an official report from the Commissioner. Yet they had asked for Iulia Iotapa. The best course would be to tell the truth. No harm there.\u201cSo far, we\u2019ve made the most success in our investigations into the nature and cause of the explosion. From this, we can construct a specific profile of our attacker. The explosion was caused by a highly complex device, some sort of alchemical distiller that imbued the payload with extraordinary levels of potency such that a massive bomb was not required to cause the extreme levels of damage we saw at The Midnight Sun. Such a device speaks either to a competent artificer, or someone with connections to an artificer.\u201dOut comes a small, ragged notebook. Its pages are filled with line after line of rather messy handwriting, a few small sketches, and what appear to be more than a few dried splotches of blood. Iulia flips to a dog eared page near the very back.\u201cNow, The Guard has paid visit to every artificer, alchemist, tinker, or even tangentially related craftsperson, both the legitimate and less legitimate ones. No luck here.\u201dThere were still a few small avenues to pursue here. Iulia deemed it unnecessary to go into further details regarding the possibility that the explosive device came from outside Isra. That had little bearing on the overall case. All evidence pointed to the attacker being someone who currently resided in Isra, not a foreign agent sent to cause chaos.\u201cWe are still working from the understanding that our attacker is Isran, or at least familiar with our politics enough to bomb The Midnight Sun at the same time as the Summit in order to send a message to the Empress. Nothing has given us reason to doubt this. Judging by the fact that this has, mercifully, been a single attack with no subsequent bombings, demands, or follow up, we can also determine that the attacker acted in isolation. Furthermore, the attacker may well have died in their own explosion, or else was seriously injured, or otherwise put off from attacking again.\u201dA pause. Grey eyes shine slightly as Iulia peers into one of the nearby fireplaces. The magical flames give off no heat, but Iulia still feels her mouth go dry as she remembers the scene at The Midnight Sun. As the fires lick away at the false logs, the smells of ash and burnt flesh seem to waft through the room. \u201cIt is odd that an act of such brutality and destructive force would happen once without any sort of context afterwards. Assuming a single attacker, we can rule out a madman or someone out of their senses. So we are left with either an injured bomber, a dead one, or, probably the worst of all, someone content to play out a very long game.\u201dAny tone other than a polite or respectful one was likely to backfire significantly here, so the Investigator chooses her words carefully. In her prior life, Iulia would feel more at ease addressing the strangeness of this meeting. Yet Investigator Iotapa is just a small part of a well tuned machine. There is no purpose in questioning the orders that brought her here today. Not yet, at least.\u201cNow, if your office has anything to add that would aid your fellows over at Investigations, Imperial Vizier, I welcome the knowledge.\u201dIulia places her notebook on the edge of the desk in front of her and pulls a small handkerchief out of one of her many pockets.

Each tray has two cups on it, one filled with water and the other some manner of red wine. Having been knocked out for a rather long time, Leiko was already salivating at the feast placed before him.

It wasn't the major score she'd been hoping for, but the payout might just be enough to keep warm food on her table for at least another week.Some hours later, Str\u00e5lende sits in her cozy little cellar, picking at a plate of shepherd's pie from a baker's stall sat on the ground before her. The gemwork and precious metals that the ring were made of had gone for more than Str\u00e5lende expected, and so she has a fairly hefty coinpurse with which to feed and clothe herself for the next little while.As she eats, she ruminates on the events of the day. That woman from her dream didn't turn out to be much of a saviour after all. Trying to recruit her into an army of magical child soldiers, if that really was the lady's plan, was incredibly skeevy at best, and the only incentive she'd gotten was an appeal to Str\u00e5lende's pride! How foolish did the Vizier think she was? She didn't get this far by fighting every guard who called her a worthless street rat. No, she'd even taken \"worthless\" as her last name, in Varan. That someone so worthless could give the guard so much trouble was a dig at their own effectiveness, if anything.Still...if she examines this opportunity through her anarchist beliefs, it could be a great way to infiltrate the Isran government, maybe cause some chaos from within. And besides, she's sure she can best whoever that old bat can throw at her. Easy.In that case, she should make sure the Vizier's claim is legitimate. Can't go walking so willingly into a trap. Str\u00e5lende sets down the wooden fork she's been digging away at the shepherd's pie with and focuses upon it, closing her eyes.She reaches out with her mind in a way she's not totally certain she ever has before -- surely not intentionally, anyway -- and all at once she can feel the floor, the fork, the pie...everything in the room, in a deeper sense than even if she were making physical contact. She focuses her mind upon the fork, and wills it to rise. She feels the vibrations of the particles as they struggle to defy gravity, and then feels the air above the fork part as it begins to slowly, steadily begins to levitate until it's eye-level with the thief girl. She's doing it! She's actually doing it! Maybe there was something to all that magic talk after all.Then, the vibrations reach a peak and the fork bursts into flame, causing Str\u00e5lende to leap to her feet in a fright, and kick the flaming piece of wood across the room, where it bounces off the wall and into her wash basin, staining the water black as the fire is extinguished in a puff of smoke.Well, that would need some work. But still, it's an exciting development, and if she works at it, she's sure she'll become the best magical person ever! And maybe even make some great scores along the way.

Despite this, however, Nine was somewhat nervous it wouldn\u2019t be enough - she hadn\u2019t slept very much the last couple of days. She spent most of her time watching the commotion of the city from where she stayed in a small, but well furnished room, high up in one of the towers of the Citadel. Nine had never seen a city before and marveled at the sheer amount of activity that went on - before a few days ago she had only seen at most twenty people together at once. Now, however, she found herself in the same polished stone room as Leiko, though she stood at the far end of it, isolated from the other groups. Her eyes scanned around the room, careful not to make eye contact as she did and her ears listened, eavesdropping on whatever conversation she could. The others seemed to be around her age and to Nine, this is where the similarities between her and them ended. Through her eavesdropping she could hear some of them exchanging names, or talking about various topics Nine could only guess were related to living within the city. Nine took in and processed all of this, her mind chugging along at a frantic pace to devise several scenarios of what could possibly happen should one of them approach her - most of them just seemed like various worst case scenarios. One thing her thoughts immediately went to were the names. She had heard a few of them, and none of the others' names were just a number like her's. How would they react if she told them her name was Nine? It didn't even seem like a name, but her old home was so different compared to this place that she had never thought she needed a better name than Nine until now. She wondered if they would make fun of her if she told them her name... and if she should try and make up a different name if they asked, or maybe she should say she didn't have one? No, bad idea. Maybe she could try and think of a name before that happened? Maybe that would work\u2026 and then her mind veered off on another path now frantically turning over many possible names she could go by from here on out - but then she realized she hadn't a clue of what made a good name. The others she grew up with in her old home... their names were numbers too after all. After a few tense seconds, Nine concluded - she couldn't possibly think of a name that wouldn't sound stupid, and any moment now someone might wander over and try and talk to her.
