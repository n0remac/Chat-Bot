If she wanted to allow him to just roam as he wished, she could just tell him he was welcome to, but she didn't! Was she just taking a gamble and hoping that he might actually prove useful while on his urban exploration? Was she just finding an excuse so people wouldn't question why he was there when others were probably not allowed within fifty feet of the Citadel's walls?

The wolf's eyes turned to look at Koitika then Naoki, growling softly in distrust, but he stopped as Deidra set a hand on his back and with a heavy exhale set to his task. The wolf bowed forward slowly, crouching as if he was about to play and pounce on the empress- especially as his maw opened showing rows of teeth. Before Naoki would think she probably ought to call for the guards, a bright light erupted from the wolf stopping just short of the dais in a swirling mass of light. Slowly, an image took form of an enormous island, starkly different than anything that Naoki would have seen in her travels.  Surrounded by leagues of water full of creatures swimming and lurking below, their light images almost brushing along Naoki's feet. But the island proper attracted more attention. Below was what looked like a massive cave system with shifting indistinct shapes, dark even in the light projection. Above the land was distinct and varied. Ice capped mountains to one side, deserts and plains to another, rich lush forests colonizing yet another corner. But in the center the earth was raised- looking as if the earth had fragmented and a floating bustling city sat there. Massive ships drifting along on wind currents came to the floating city, docking at the ports. If Naoki looked even slightly above, she could see a city above the island, winged creatures of all types soaring in the sky. Deidra smiled softly as she looked at the image fondly and Koitika from her place inhaled sharply in recognition. \"....This is my home. Edan.\" She spoke almost reverently as she walked forward passing through the light projection. The look in her eyes could only be described as longing. It had been far too long since she had been home \"... Longer ago than either of us could possibly comprehend, the ancients created Edan. They foresaw what is known as the Cataclysm's arrival and wanted to create a kingdom safe and apart from the rest of the turbulent world. One to foster and conserve all of life in it's many forms in case life did not remain in the event's wake. Ancient wards keep us hidden from the rest of the world as  well as those of the kingdom of the deep... dissuading those unwanted from growing near. None without the blood or blessing of Edan can find our kingdom or hope to survive the trek to it. It was to insulate life from the chaos that built away from us...\" Deidra paused then before looking away from the floating city to Naoki again. \"But the times of chaos are far behind us. I have seen your country. You are not the barbarians you once were-if the tales of what the mainland were even accurate. Our citizenry have visited your country and done well and returned with great stories and new perspectives simply not found in Edan...

The biggest is trade protection, an' we do this with the help of the native Dwarven population.\" Fontaine soon produces a sketching of a room with a large stone tablet in the middle. \"We have runesmiths working around the clock, monitoring all the ships that want t' call Libertalia home. Each one is marked, and if one gets too close to a trade route, they get watched. If they come to my port with fresh cargo? Well, considering Ol' Ogden was about to be keelhauled, you get the picture.\" She hands the diagram sketch to Naoki to inspect.

We're an industrious sort, and our Island provides a decent amount o' natural resources. Our mines produce top quality minerals, mined by some of the most experienced dwarves on the planet. We also use our mines as quarries for all sorts of stone.\" \"Then there's the forests,\" she continues. \"Our wood further inland is sturdy, sturdy enough that some o' our newer ships and homes are made from it. Even my father's manor is, and I'm quite comfortable to call it home.\" She opens the book and begins flipping through pages. \"We also brew our own ales, and we're expecting to start fermenting wine in the coming years. You'll get a taste for our goods once you try the samples we brought, im sure.\" She looks up with a smile before she goes back to the book. \"And ships, of course. Our shipwrights usually made ships for my fleet, but with international trade coming in, we are open to the idea of building top quality ships for our partners.\" She closes the book and also offers into Naoki. It seems to be the condensed version of Libertalia's production ledger. Some sort of catalogue, really. \"But we also make our money by being a trading hub,\" she says. \"Merchants from all over sell their wares, and we sell it forward. Just about anything goes through our ports, if you need it we can provide. Of courses the spice trade is incredible this time of year.\" \"In reality, Empress Naoki,\" she says, crossing her arms. \"Libertalia's ports aren't much more dangerous than your own.

Your system seems robust and is very much required.\u201d \u201cBut when you say you\u2019d like to open trade relations, I assume you mean trade, as it is perpetrated by traders \u2014 merchants. The owners of ships who make a living buying goods in one place and selling them in another for profit. The well-to-do sorts who live in large houses, dress in fine silks, and often congregate in The Moonlight Eclipse. It\u2019s their moving of goods that allows producers in Isra to export their wares overseas, and it is they who bring exotic items from abroad to be sold in the markets.\u201d\u201cAnd, with no disrespect intended, they don\u2019t care how \u2018fun\u2019 Libertalia\u2019s port may or may not be. I might for the purposes of visiting, but they make their decisions on the basis of risk versus reward \u2014 on cold, hard gold. Most of the time, seeing as how they value their lives and their ship is the sum of their livelihood, they\u2019ll choose to take the safe routes that net them a tidy profit rather than risking it all for perhaps a larger payout. These aren\u2019t grizzled captains coming together to exchange the goods they\u2019ve appropriated, these are members of the gentry \u2014 soft, portly, and risk-averse.\u201d\u201cAnd why should they visit a port that that harbors criminals in the most literal sense? They would be standing shoulder-to-shoulder and interacting with the very same who practice piracy on the open sea. Perhaps not on them, perhaps not near the port, and perhaps not as a majority, but piracy all the same. Even if it is absolutely certain it will not be eaten, and even if it knows there are carrots there, how many rabbits do you think would venture into the wolf den?\u201d\u201cIf all I tell my people is that there is legitimate trade to be found in Libertalia, yes, a few will go. But then all goods that they may bring back are automatically of questionable legality because it\u2019s entirely possible that those goods, perhaps though the hands of a middleman, were once owned by a trader just the same as themselves. If you\u2019re only enforcing the most basic laws of decency, follow logically that Libertalia is the premier location for pirates to offload goods under the pretense of 'legality', because it's not illegal if no law exists to make it so.\u201d \u201cNot only that, but you can best your last silver that Isran traders will return with illegal goods hidden in among the lumber and minerals. Visiting under the pretense of legitimate trade will enable the more mischievous merchants to import huge quantities of whatever they can buy in Libertalia, completely compromising all of my import restrictions and supplying the blackmarkets of Isra as they never have before.\u201dEmpress Naoki shrugs. \u201cI\u2019d like to work with you, and I may very well take you up on that offer to visit, but based on what you\u2019ve told me so far, I truly don\u2019t see why opening for trade with Libertalia would be a good idea for Isra. There exists the potential for a few people to make a lot of money, yes, but the decision-making apparatus of The Isran Empire has successful businesses of her own and sees no justifiable reason to support yours.\u201dAgain, The Empress shrugs, palms up.

We ourselves do our checks on every ship to ensure nobody is carrying the one commodity that is punishable by death.

That would be a world wide manhunt, and I don't see that as a wise investment.\" \"But you know all that,\" the Captain says. \"You'd be a bad leader not to, and I've heard otherwise. If the issue really is your fat bourgeois traders\" - a word she had added to her lexicon after a fairly odd 'for the workers' fellow came to Libertalia - \"Then I can only say that they would be highly protected in my waters. Trade is our lifeblood, it's no longer the pilfering ways of the past. They'd likely be as protected in our waters as they would yours, as they would in our ports as well. It's the only way we can maintain our paradise.\" \"Anything that leaves our storehouses with the Libertalia seal is legitimate, that I can personally guarantee,\" she continues, trying to remember the main points of Naoki's arguments. \"But the rest, we know when a shipment has been stolen, and when it hasn't been. My father used to be the king of stolen goods, we can often see them a mile away. The vast majority that we receive are from legitimate independent traders, not corsairs, probably the same traders that trade in every port.\" The woman smiles again, however, undeterred by her disappointment. \"But I think I've made my case clear, and if my word is not enough to at least make y' consider the notion of trade, then I doubt nothin' more will. You've made it clear that you understand what we're tryin' to become, and you have my respect for that.

The fact that you\u2019re legitimizing the place and turning the focus away from crime is good, but you\u2019re not changing the premise upon which order in its society is based.\u201d\u201cThe people of Isra don\u2019t commit crimes because they know that the law will be upheld throughout the land and all who commit crimes are justly punished for it. Crime still happens, but by taking away the reasons to and giving very good reasons why not to, the overwhelming majority never even consider crime in the first place, and order is achieved. If an assassin were to kill someone here in Isra, Isra would disseminate wanted posters and the assassin wouldn\u2019t be able to show their face anywhere. The people do not want a killer running around, but they do want the reward money. Sending wanted posters to Libertalia is a waste of time, because you do not enforce the rule of law and the people of Libertalia have no issue with having a killer in their midst \u2014 because many of them may very well be criminals of some sort themselves.\u201d\u201cIf I endorse Libertalia and make it easy to get there, I would be endorsing a refuge to escape my own law \u2014 easily, without suspicion, for the low low price of passage on a merchant\u2019s ship. An assassin could ply their trade at night and catch a ship out the following morning, escaping as soon as the ship sets off.

If hostilities are initiated by either party toward another signatory or their allies or trading partners, this document will be considered null and void.The ratification of this document allows for immediate and unrestricted trade between the merchants of the Kingdom of the Black Vale and the Empire of Isra, provided the merchants are under the control of the Von Haren estate and Isra-controlled trading companies, respectively.Upon ratification of this document, an embassy of the Kingdom of the Black Vale shall be established in the Free City of Isra, staffed by the Kingdom of the Black Vale, and under the sovereign control of the Kingdom of the Black Vale. Emissaries shall be granted diplomatic immunity from the laws of the Empire of Isra. Violations of Isran law shall be reported to the Kingdom of the Black Vale to be dealt with under Von Haren legal guidelines, although the Empire of Isra reserves the right to expel emissaries at will.Finally, this treaty obligates the Kingdom of the Black Vale to assist the Empire of Isra in its management of the blighted lands within the Eastern Forest, so long as this treaty is in effect. Black Vale quarantine outposts will be established at regular intervals of one-hundred (100) meters around the quarantine site, to be garrisoned as the Kingdom of the Black Vale sees fit. Regular culling excursions shall be made every two (2) weeks into the quarantine site by Black Vale forces, until such a time as a permanent solution is found.This document shall be signed in the presence of emissaries from both the Kingdom of the Black Vale and the Empire of Isra and copies produced as requested for viewing by the King Ulfang von Haren's court and the Empress Naoki's bureaucracy.There is a blank space large enough for two signatures at the bottom of the document.\"It is distasteful for me to admit, but I require material help in rebuilding the Black Vale.
