A few light squeezing motions are employed to loosen up the shoulders, before Naoki\u2019s hands slide their way back down Liz\u2019 spine in one fluid stroke.

Another predatory sort of grin crosses her face as she finishes rubbing the oil into her hands. To begin, she places her hands on the sides of Liz\u2019 waist, giving a few experimental rubs but really just testing the waters, feeling out the shape. Gradually, her hands slide down. Down to the hips, and even lower than that in rhythmic, curvilinear strokes, carrying Liz\u2019 underwear down with themWith the posterior presented, Naoki\u2019s hands stroke upward and toward the center, rendezvousing in the small of Liz\u2019 back before again going their separate ways downward. Using primarily the palms, Naoki makes long, fluid strokes down from the lower back to the buttocks, and back up again. Eventually, she transitions into kneading motions focusing on the bottom. Here, the flesh isn\u2019t quite as pliable as one might like. Some combination of muscular tension and tone. This elicits a soft sort of chuckle from Naoki. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of tension in here; your butt is saddle-shaped, Liz.\u201dNaoki begins to apply petrissage to remedy this. Forming an angle with one hand and her other thumb, she kneads the tissue, squeezing it, pressing it, and rolling it about beneath her hands. Each motion is very strictly centripetal, intending to aid the flow of blood up and out toward the heart. She debates utilizing tapotement to more thoroughly work the soreness out, but decides against it after glancing up to see Liz\u2019 facial expression. One of complete submission. Yet another carnivorous sort of smirk crosses Naoki\u2019s face, and she debates cutting the massage portion of their time together short, but again, decides against it. It isn\u2019t as if either of them have anywhere else to be. Instead, she shimmies downward once again, bringing her knees to a stop on either size of Liz\u2019 feet. Reaching upward, Naoki prefaces the third stage of her massage by finishing her removal of Liz\u2019 underwear, sliding them all the way down and off around her feet. They, too, are tossed off unceremoniously to sit with the rest. Then she begins. Starting with upward, flowing strokes starting at the ankle and going all the way up to the thigh and back down again, Naoki moves from the outer legs to the inner in tandem, bringing the tips of her fingers to brush tantalizingly against the erogenous zone between Liz\u2019 legs at the height of each motion. Each consecutive upward stroke is applied with more gentle pressure than the last, and the rhythmic motions seem unending.However, she does not dwell there. Leaving the honeypot untapped, Naoki moves all the way back down the legs, focusing her attention next on the feet. After taking another moment to re-oil her hands, Naoki addresses both feet simultaneously, switching from her palms to the pads of her fingers to make small circles of pressure just beneath the toes. Gradually, she slides upward, around the arch of the foot, up over the heels, and then addressing the ankles. After repeating these motions a few times, Naoki\u2019s hands begin to move once again up the legs, still maintaining that slow, steady rhythm. Then she begins the downward strokes. Starting at the inner thigh, Naoki\u2019s hands slide their way down all the way down to the soles of the feet before sliding their way back up. With each downward rub, the pressure increases slightly before easing off for the gentle upstroke. After a few repetitions, Naoki figures that Liz\u2019 legs are about finished. With a mildly pleased sort of grin on her face, Naoki moves back, disengaging herself to sit properly on her behind near Liz\u2019 feet. Reaching a hand over, she jostles Liz\u2019 behind with a playful shove- really more of a slap, and speaks, \u201cThat\u2019s it for your back.

As Naoki's hands traced the outline of her erogenous areas, Liz gasped and gripped the sheets, the thrill of it sending shivers up her spine and she squirmed a bit under the pleasure. Naoki's touch would elicit a rather, noticeable reaction that blended in a bit with oil. Liz was unaware of that particular reaction, but she was feeling very flushed and was momentarily unsure of how to respond to the cat-woman's request.\"Ummm...yes...yes of course milady.\"Her tone was a bit unsure as her divided brain continued to fight against itself, but again the pleasured part won and Liz found herself rolling over at Naoki's request.

Whose skills, both martial and in command, played a significant role only days ago in what would have been otherwise another great cataclysm. Blushing wildly, absolutely submissive, totally naked, lying on her back, oiled up, and all but begging to be ravished. And, while Naoki\u2019s benevolence is often limitless, so too is her capacity to tease. Standing from the sofa, she sheds her robe, taking a few steps up toward the head of the seat. Moving back up again onto the sofa, Naoki kneels with her knees to either side of Liz\u2019 head. As she reapplies oil to her hands, Naoki looks down to make eye contact, flashing a cheerful smile that contrasts wildly with the tenderness of her motions as she sets in for the third stage of the massage. Sliding her hands around the upper chest, Naoki again appraises the area with experimental rubs and presses before beginning properly, starting with the shoulder well. Between thumb and forefinger, she applies pressure to the point in the middle of Liz\u2019 tendons in the base of her neck to release another node of tension. However, she dwells here for only a moment before moving on down around the shoulders to the clavicle. Pressing gently she spends a moment tenderly stroking at the erogenous zone just below Liz\u2019 collarbone before moving downward once again, sliding between Liz\u2019 breasts to pause upon finding the slight indentation just above her heart in the center of her chest. Here, in this intention, Naoki applies pressure with two fingers from each hand, draining the tension in Liz\u2019 chest up, into her warm hands, and away. For a handful of moments, the ceaseless ministrations pause as Naoki continues to apply pressure, simply breathing in pace with Liz. Presently, she removes her hands, and sits back up. This time, the oil is applied directly to Liz, poured across her chest. While it might be a bit cold at first, Naoki\u2019s hands set in once again to spread their warmth, starting around the shoulders before using a connecting stroke to slide her palms down the chest, and up across the breasts. A few full-handed grasping and kneading motions gradually transition into a gentle caress, and then light pinching, rolling the nub around between forefinger and thumb, always careful not to tug too hard, or push too far. After a few sensuous moments of that, Naoki withdraws, coming back up to the neck and head.  To begin the fourth and final stage of what can plausibly be called a \u2018massage\u2019, Naoki\u2019s hands make long, smooth strokes up Liz\u2019 siders to her shoulders, continuing up to use the backs of her hands to stroke the neck and chin. Moving up once again, the pads of Naoki\u2019s thumbs move in small circles as they slide from the shoulders up the neck to the base of the skull.Running her hands up the neck, Naoki cups Liz\u2019 head lightly in her hands, lifting it slightly off the sofa. Using her forefingers, Naoki presses into the small hollows where skull meets neck, moving in small circles to stimulate the erogenous zones there. Presently, she gently allows Liz\u2019s head to rest back on the surface of the sofa, bringing her hands back up to massage the temples with firm, circular strokes. Next, Naoki lightly traces the outlines of Liz\u2019 jawline, forehead, and nose, before moving to apply pressure to the center of the forehead, another point of tension release. Finally, to conclude the massage, Naoki begins to stroke and rub at Liz\u2019 ears, one of the body\u2019s more sensitive organs. However, like all good things, the massage draws to a close as Naoki removes her hands and sits up again, idly stroking at Liz\u2019 hair but not otherwise continuing the massage proper. For a moment she simply sits, allowing Liz to revel in the relaxation of the completed massage for a handful of moments.Naoki could opt to simply allow Liz to pass into unconsciousness. Goodness knows she needs some rest after all that. But they both know that Liz needs something else even more. Again Naoki stands, making her way back down to Liz\u2019 feet. However, instead of straddling, Naoki assumes a prone position, resting on her elbows and facing Liz.. Naoki uses her hands to part the feet before her, and with them, Liz\u2019 legs. Shimming upward, Naoki moves her body up to occupy the space between the parted legs, tracing one oiled finger up the inside of Liz\u2019 thighs. Wordlessly, she flashes Liz another predatory grin, and begins to address the one portion of Liz\u2019 body that was not covered in the so called \u201cfull body\u201d massage; the part that is most in need of a loving touch. Sometimes, the best way to deal with accumulated stress and tension is to build it up. To bring it all up, gathering it in one spot, in the forefront of one\u2019s mind. To bring it all to balance on the point of a needle, on the crest of a wave. And to leave it there, perfectly balanced, leaning neither here nor there, simply resting at the precipice. And then, just when it seems as if it can balance no longer, to allow it to escape, in great, cascading waves that seem to have no end. Waves enough to wash over one\u2019s entire body, to wash away all coherent thought, leaving one in a nirvanic state of bliss. Freedom of form and mind, oblivious to all external circumstances, simply riding the endlessly cascading waves of pleasure from one climax to the next. And sometimes this isn\u2019t enough. Sometimes this procedure needs to be repeated upwards of twenty times over the next three hours. Which is exactly what Naoki proceeds to do.When Liz comes to, she might notate that a few things have changed. First and foremost, she\u2019s lying on an entirely separate section of the seating area, and is covered from the waist down with a blanket. Instead of resting her head on a pillow, or simply the surface of the sofa, Liz\u2019 head is sitting squarely in Naoki\u2019s lap, who still hasn\u2019t located any clothing to replace her robe. One of Naoki\u2019s hands idly strokes at Liz\u2019 hair, as if her head is some small animal snuggled up between her thighs to be petted. Her other hand holds a book open for her reading. From her position, Liz may be able to look up and read along, and would find it to be a book about military logistics, of all things. Some light reading, apparently. A look toward the window would betray the fact that the sun has long since set, and the coolness of night has once again settled over Isra. Additionally, Liz\u2019 clothing is nowhere to be seen.If Naoki notices when Liz wakes, she doesn\u2019t say so, instead continuing to read away, studying the proper ways to supply an army.

I like your butt. And the way that you\u2019re muscled and well toned, but offer no resistance as I explore your body.  And the way you moan, and the way you blush when you\u2019re embarrassed, and the dichotomy between how you\u2019re always so serious, so stony and whatnot most of the time, but like putty in my hands, so sensitive, and receptive to each and every touch. I\u2019ve found a new side of you that I doubt anyone really suspected you had, and simply thinking about that, I\u2019m finding, is a big turn-on.\u201dAlmost unconsciously, Naoki\u2019s tail finds its way up between her legs, where it begins to stroke idly.

I have too many people I\u2019d like to spend time with, and too many responsibilities, and not enough time in each day to do everything I want to. My thought patterns are becoming increasingly related to schedules and time allocation. Like, after you fell into your peaceful slumber, I considered leaving you with a note. In the hours you were asleep, I could have been doing any number of things besides providing my thighs as your pillows. I decided not to, considering the impression that would give, and how important this conversation is in my eyes, but the fact that I considered it seriously\u2026 I don\u2019t like it. Even with the reduced workload I\u2019ve engineered by delegating so much to Ryden and The Conclave, even with the ability to communicate telepathically with the majority of my closest associates, I still don\u2019t have enough time to do everything I\u2019d like to, fulfill my responsibilities to my best capacity, and take time to myself.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s irritating. Foreseeable, but irritating, in that there isn\u2019t much I can do about it. So I\u2019d like more time, on a day to day basis, to do what I\u2019d like to. Or the ability to be in multiple places at once, accomplishing multiple tasks simultaneously. Or some equivalent. I\u2019m not sure.

Grumbling quietly to herself, Naoki slinks over to the sofa where Liz is lying and assists her by removing the dirty shirt, which she proceeds to utilise to wipe the majority of the sick off her face. Afterwards, the shirt is dropped unceremoniously to the floor beside the chair. Without any further procedures, Naoki turns about on one heel and proceeds through the curtains at the back of the room into the area beyond. There she remains for the space of a few minutes before returning, a few items in hand. The first, a simple wooden cup, halfway filled with a funny sort of off-whitish liquid. The second, a small, well made but otherwise unremarkable wooden box, of the sort that one might expect to find jewelry or other small items in. Seating herself on the arm of the sofa nearest to Liz\u2019 head, Naoki proceeds to eyeball Liz. After a minute\u2019s worth of ogling, Naoki decides that Liz isn\u2019t nearly as cute when she\u2019s drunk as she is when she\u2019s embarrassed, and resolves to attempt to dissuade her from further drinking in the future. For the time being, however, it doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s going to be waking up. With this in mind, Naoki proceeds to open the box with one hand and dip the other finger in the cup. One would find- if they would care to look, that the box is segmented into four portions, each filled with a different color of some manner of clay. One blue, one red, another yellow, and the final black. Dragging her wet finger across the black portion, some of the pigment comes off, clinging to her finger. Very carefully as to avoid getting it on herself, Naoki then drags her finger across the area between Liz\u2019 nose and upper lip. Two careful strokes later, Liz is now the proud owner of a painted-on-mustache. Next, Naoki dips her next finger first in the cup, then in the blue, and moves downward to Liz\u2019 upper chest.

Healing magic isn\u2019t quite as rare as all that, among mages. I think that in reading a report last month, about seventy percent of all the mages of The Conjunction are competent in some form of healing magic, and a fair number have specialized into it. I\u2019ve heard that basic healing magic a fairly easy and practical thing, so I can see why.\u201d\u201cBut the thing about that is that I\u2019m already trying to minimize loss of life.\u201dHere, she pauses, fixing Arya with a somewhat flat look before continuing, \u201cThis war has been in the making for months. I\u2019ve already scoured Isra for any and all who are willing to utilize their skills of healing- magical or not, to assist the wounded. Some were willing to go directly into battle, and are actually enlisted with some of the legions. They wear green armbands to distinguish themselves. Other individuals were not willing to risk their own lives, and have joined the Medical Brigade, which is part of the greater Logistical Sustainment Corps.\u201d\u201cSo, you\u2019re going to have some difficulties if you intend to run around Isra to recruit for your organization, and I\u2019m not willing to reallocate any of the Medical Brigade to your command. Most of them wouldn\u2019t be exceptionally thrilled to be ordered to heal soldiers that- after being healed, fully intend to get back up and go run an Isran soldier through. Some of whom may be friends of relatives of the healers in question.\u201d\u201cBeyond that, it also seems somewhat counterintuitive to me\u2026 If you hypothetically have enough resources to heal both parties in an engagement and allow each of them to get up and go stab the other party until they end up back in your hospital, you would just be prolonging the engagement. \u2026 I could see it if you were going to charge the soldiers- because that would be business, but then that sort of defeats the purpose of a humanitarian organization.\u201d\u201cAs another thing\u2026 if you do do that- heal Goraian soldiers and allow them to get back up and continue fighting, you would become a target.\u201d Tilting her head downward, Naoki fixes Arya with a sober, humorless look, intending to convey that she is not being facetious at all. \u201cHowever!\u201d she cuts in before a response can begin, \u201cAllow me to state this, to clue you in, as it were. \u2026 This isn\u2019t a war against Goraia or the people in it. It isn\u2019t a war against the people of Medan or even the Goraian army. You may call me a politician for saying this, but this is liberation. Ideally, the only individuals who would even be so much as captured are the high-ranking figures of the Goraian government- those who have ordered the atrocities to happen.\u201d\u201cBecause the people- they\u2019re not bad people. It hasn\u2019t been very long. Most of the people, most of their soldiers, don\u2019t believe in it- believe in the state. They don\u2019t have any loyalty to the government or their superiors. They\u2019re fighting because if they don\u2019t fight, they\u2019ll be imprisoned, tortured, killed, or whatever else.\u201d\u201cAs such, this war, this liberation, this endeavor won\u2019t be nearly as difficult as it would be otherwise. The soldier to fear is the one who defends their homeland to their last breath, because if they don\u2019t, their wives, families, and daughters- the things he cares about, will be taken away.\u201d\u201cAlso to be feared is the he who seeks vengeance against those who have already taken what he cares about away, such as the Medanese refugee, but that\u2019s beside the point. What I\u2019m working my way around to is that in orchestrating this war, I\u2019ve given very specific, nonstandard orders. For example, before every battle begins, we will be announcing something to the effect of \u2018If you surrender, we will treat you properly.\u2019 And then we will. We will take captives wherever and whenever possible, and will heal them all, regardless. We will make it very easy for defectors, and difficult for their commanding officers. Ideally, this would be a bloodless liberation, but I\u2019m not idealistic enough to believe that. I have done what I can do and will continue to do what can be done to minimize loss of life and damage to Medan, but when one\u2019s opponent makes use of mind magics and threatens their soldiers into fighting, there\u2019s only so much that can be done.\u201d\u201cSo I\u2019ll offer this feedback, and then give you a few suggestions. First of all, I think it would be exceptionally foolish for you to travel into Goraia alone or unarmed, regardless of your intentions, and even more so to take a bunch of non-combatant healers with you. Odds are, based on what I\u2019ve heard, you\u2019ll be enslaved and forced to do as they bid- healing, or comforting the soldiers in other ways.\u201d This is offered in the most serious tone, with a cautioning and concerned look. Even though Naoki isn\u2019t particularly close to Arya, she still wouldn\u2019t like to see her among the rescued sex slaves. \u201cAnd, even on the off chance that they allow you to do what you intend without molesting you, you\u2019ll be working in indirect opposition to the goals of my legions, and that\u2019s simply not wise.\u201d\u201cFurthermore, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll have much luck trying to organize the sort of thing you\u2019re describing, mostly because all of my human resources are already in play. You\u2019re not really going to find many qualified and willing individuals in Isra. However, if you can assemble the sort of thing you\u2019re suggesting, perhaps by enlisting the aid of Gauldin or The Land Tillers where I have been unable to, I am willing to support you financially out of my own pocket- under the understanding that you\u2019re not going to needlessly prolong the hostilities.\u201d\u201cBeyond that\u2026 It\u2019s a little bit late for this sort of thing. As we speak, scouts have entered Goraia and have begun to relay data. The First Legion and Second Legions have already been deployed, and are en route to their respective destinations. I myself will be departing via teleportation tomorrow morning, and I expect the invasion to begin properly later that day.\u201dOffering a small sort of shrug, she continues, \u201cSo, I think you\u2019ve got a few options. Firstly, you could go try to petition some other nation or a private organization to provide the healers you need. If you do, I\u2019ll see to it that you get the other things you need, and are assisted however possible. Secondly, you could simply come with me tomorrow, and practice your healing individually, on the spot, with the healers I already have. Doing that would probably offer you the most opportunities to save lives, including those of the captives we take. Thirdly, you could also go join up with the Medical Brigade as they come along behind the legions, and fix up soldiers that are sent back, and see to it that the captives we take are treated well and kept in good health. To be completely frank with you, the current manager of the Medical Brigade is a bit of an idiot, and I don\u2019t need to justify staffing decisions to anyone.\u201d A not-particularly-subtle offer.

Reaching around with her own hands to begin massaging Arya\u2019s breasts, Naoki leans forward to smother the paladin's lips in her own as the seventh appendage makes its presence known between Arya\u2019s legs.Over the course of the next couple of hours, Naoki would continue with what she would call \u2018the massage\u2019.

It\u2019s quite gratifying, Naoki is finding, to make use of these gifts to make Arya, with her purity and chastity and whatnot, moan in such a manner. Additionally, with her \u2018aura\u2019 on at its theoretical maximum (How did that happen?), these activities ought to be generating quite a substantial amount of harnessable lust for The Demonlady, The Circle, and Forni, Naoki thinks.Speaking of Forni, he is, for this time, left largely to his own devices. Naoki is somewhat preoccupied and assumes that he will have the best sense of where (and into whom) to insert himself for maximum effect, and so only gives him very general instructions.Only after Arya stands on the brink of unconsciousness and her legs have given out does Naoki feel that she has completed the massage. After bringing Arya all the way up, holding here there for a few minutes more, and then bringing her down once more (for good measure), Naoki brings her down in a literal sense, placing Arya very carefully onto the cushions in the depression located in the center of the Den.

Sliding her sinuous tentacle over to the left, it slips under the hem of the blanket and into its destination. Naoki bites her lip in an attempt to stifle a moan, so surprised by the intensity of the feeling.All still in the interest of mutual gratification, Naoki tells herself. Still mutual. Perhaps a bit biased toward her own, in this case, perhaps, but she was doing all of the lifting earlier. Arya won\u2019t mind this, surely. Not when it feels this good.And in this manner, Naoki does her best to see to it that Arya\u2019s sleep will contain only the very best sort of dreams. Naoki does, of course, take care to see that such things are done about as discreetly as they can be, and hopefully do not wake Arya or otherwise interfere with her much needed slumber.However, Naoki herself does not sleep, as sleeping would mean stopping, and if these magics allow her to continue tirelessly, why shouldn\u2019t she? Her tail dangles off the far side of the cushion, the tip twitching occasionally. On the occasions that Forni growls particularly loudly, Naoki\u2019s ears turn to investigate, before going back about their business. In the hours that pass, Naoki idly contemplates a few matters (most of which are entirely indecent) and silently experiments with what sorts of exotic things she\u2019s able to do with these appendages of hers. If she can sense Arya beginning to stir toward wakefulness or otherwise suspects that Arya might be waking up, Naoki would slow before fully withdrawing.

He is also a very enthusiastic and caring lover, perhaps surprisingly, and while he is perhaps not as well-versed as Naoki in the art of lovemaking, he is still clearly no beginner.
