She sighs and stands, turning toward her armoire, viewing herself in the mirror upon one of its doors. She looks terrible; her hair is disheveled and she has black rings under her eyes from lack of sleep. After an hour, however, she looks as lovely as usual, her tiredness covered with makeup and her hair brushed into shape.

Orgath didn't actually know the more intricate details of his master's origin, he was but a servant and the need for this information had never risen before. \"He served faithfully, but when his ambition clashed with that of his superiors, he was forced to lay waste upon them and their legacy. He set out to rule the mortal world from whence he had came, and returned with an ambition to dominate all life\". Orgath paused, almost awkwardly so. \"He came to the king's of old and instated himself as their ruler. The king of kings. Those who opposed him learned swiftly that his offer was non negotiable. It was half a millennium of peace before he discovered new shores to conquer, he encountered a society of elves that would ultimately lead to his fall.

They had their three most powerful wizards join forces and then do battle with him. The fighting went on for a week, but eventually Al M\u00farin found himself defeated.

Do not leave anything out, or I will know. I wish to see what others have to say about this Al Murin before I think about the terms of our arrangement. Go, now.\"Andraste dismisses the wraith with a gesture, and returns to her desk, reaching under it and removing the crystal from a heavily warded secret compartment invisible to one who isn't looking for it and nigh-impossible to open for any but its owner. She rolls the crystal around in her hands, studying it once more. Its dark, shimmering surface is strangely compelling to her. She decides to probe it mentally, and suddenly, she establishes a connection with it, and it begins to glow. Now, she's getting somewhere. She decides to begin the contract despite not yet having worked out the exact terms. It can't hurt to just restore a bit of its energy, after all.She cups her hands into a small fleshy bowl, holding the crystal within as she closes her eyes and concentrates, focusing on the link between herself and the crystal. Mana begins to flow through her and into the crystal, her palms suddenly beginning to glow, thin, sparking tendrils of semi-translucent magenta light trailing from her fingers into the crystal. Almost as a dream, she begins to slip away into unconsciousness, the crystal hungrily absorbing all the mana she channels into it, filling its empty depths with power.What feels like a few moments later, she jolts back up, panting heavily and blinking down at the crystal, severing her link with it. When had she started sweating? More importantly, why does she feel so weak? Mana exhaustion. It must be, she thinks. Despite the magnitude of power she channelled into the crystal just a moment before, nearly exhausting her reserves, the crystal glows only slightly brighter, although Andraste can sense how much more powerful it truly is. She'll have to be careful with this one, she thinks as she turns it around in her hand once again, studying it one last time before a trembling arm reaches beneath her desk again and stores it away. She struggles to her feet, her knees weak, walking toward the door to the side room with the bath and stepping through the doorway.It's been almost half an hour since Andraste was left by Vain, what seemed like a few moments to her in reality quite a stretch of time. She moves over to Vain and nearabout collapses into his arms, breathing heavily. \"Mm...the wraith is dealt with and my work is done for the day...we may relax, my dear Vain,\" she murmurs, her voice tired, but also somehow tinged with excitement. It feels good to be pressed up against the daemon's strong chest, wrap her arms about his warm, powerful body.

Wickan propaganda has spread quite quickly, much faster than Konrad anticipated I see.  I'd very much like to find out who spread the rumors that we killed innocents.\"Adrian switched his stance, as if preparing to give a lesson, but spoke with honesty and in a friendly manner.  \"Do you even know why the order was founded?  To protect Angelists in Eastwick, the home of the Wickans.  It was the Wickans who kidnapped the Vessians and burned them to the stake before their own idols.  It was the Wickans who killed the innocents and burnt our villages - not the other way around.  It was in these Wickan raids that claimed lives of our Hochmeister's own kin.  Konrad then rounded up his closest friends, all of whom were knights, and brought them before the Vessian Emperor and the High King of Asgeir.  It was there he announced his goal: to form a knightly order whose intent was to protect Angelists, stop Wickan raids, and rescue our kidnapped kin.\"\"The Wickans do not have a standing army - only men and women who skirmish within the safety of their forests, before retreating back to their villages.  We suffered heavy casualties, but in the end we rescued many innocent men, women, and children who had been kidnapped and enslaved by the Wickans.  Unfortunately, the large majority of them were mass slaughtered as sacrifices to their gods.  The knights themselves were captured at various points, and were roasted in the very armor they wore.  Bodies of our kin, our brothers and sisters, hung in the forest on the paths to each village, an intimidation tactic.\"\"As the Wickan skirmishers retreated back to their villages, it was very hard to determine who was innocent and who was not.  So we'd take them by surprise - appearing the dark of the night, rounding them up and demanding to know who the killers were.  When none answered, we began executing the ones who owned bloody swords and newly-made weapons in their homes, as they were the likely perpetrators.  After a few executions, the Wickans confessed, and we rightly punished them - the same way you wanted to do to Red, no?  We then relocated the villagers further towards Vessia, under the watchful eye of our strongholds.  They were given farmland on important trade routes, and allowed to trade with the Vessian citizens.\"\"One day, Andraste, I hope you have to face similar circumstances.  Just imagine, every day someone new is missing.  Every day, a village is burned.  Every day, the remains of your loved ones are returned to you - charred like a badly roasted boar.  Would you sit idly by and let this happen?  I don't think so, not a powerful woman like you.  You'd find the people who did such a thing, and you'd punish them, just like you was going to punish Red.  The only difference between my order and everyone else's, is that we gave our enemy's family land to live on; we didn't leave them in the dust of some pointless conquest.  Everywhere we've been we've built hospitals for the sick and wounded, asking for no payment in return.  We've built orphanages, accepting lost children whose parents have been killed in the pointless conflicts that occur elsewhere.\u00a0 Because of us, you don't have to worry about all the boys and girls who's fathers were killed by the Bottle Demons and by Red.\u00a0 Because of us, you need not worry about the injured men and women of the Free City.\"\"So please tell me, good lady, what has my order done that makes them evil?

Your Varan allies murdered an entire village full of innocents in our lands for hitting their leader in the eye with a pebble. This is not how The Free City treats its citizens.

Innocent women and children have died at the hands of your cruel knights. You would hide behind your vaunted achievements, your precious orphanages and hospitals. They are nothing more than a front for a band of criminals and terrorists. How many children have been made orphans by your crusade? Are those 'heathens' welcome within your orphanage walls?

And your jagged side makes your words useless.\"There's a fire in the sorceress' eyes that is startling to any who know her calm and passive demeanour, but she quickly hides it when she's finished with her rants. She turns back to her desk as she continues to speak. The edge in her voice has given way to her placid, soothing voice once again as she continues, \"Your aura would seem to indicate your intent is pure. If you truly wish to see the light rather than wallowing in the darkness of rhetoric, ask your Hochmeister why he has done nothing to stop the sadist's killing spree. Dietrich is an attack dog that your Order can level upon the innocent who would try to hold onto their sense of dignity, their ancient heritage, instead of bowing to your oppressive ways.

The entry hall of The Enclave is much like the foyer of a library, in that is a large, tall-ceilinged room whose walls are covered in bookcases and shelves. Directly ahead upon entering through the tall double doors, one would find a sort of reception desk, though it isn\u2019t tooled for reception as much as it is for assisting young acolytes in finding what resources they require. And indeed, there are a handful of relatively young individuals- presumably acolytes, standing at the desk, consulting their more veteran peers. One of them, a woman of apparently perhaps forty, makes a beckoning motion, and in response, a particular scroll dislodges itself from a bookcase some thirty feet overhead and floats its way down into her hand. She, in turn, hands it to the young man before her, who was presumably looking for it. All around, such casual displays of magic are practiced in such number and with such a blase attitude, lending a somewhat surreal factor to it.

He would show it to the elf, and she would be able to see it seemed to be a rather ordinary marble, no runes or any other such things etched into it. It was made of glass.\u00a0\"I will toss this marble up into the air, and I will complete my demonstration before it hits the ground,\" he said calmly. There was a noticeable uptick of mana in the immediate area then as Daedalus\u00a0drew the energy to fuel his next spel. He held up the hand he was not holding the marble in then, his pointer finger outstretched and glowing with mana.

Daedalus had closed his eyes at some point during this process but would now open them to look at the female elf that stood across from him, his eyes which normally glowed faintly with a golden light now glowed much brighter due to the amount of mana the spell demanded he channeled.\u00a0\"It is about ready now,\" he said, and then he tossed the marble into the air, \"Ruluausu.\"The marble would seem to move in slow motion then, its trajectory through the air slowing down to a snail's pace, though Daedalus and the elf would remain unhindered, \"Time is slowed in this room now, for everything and everyone but you and me unless I say otherwise, as I specified while casting. So now I have a few minutes before the marble touches the ground.\"Daedalus would lower the hand he had previously used to draw the runes with, though his eyes still glowed with the same golden aura caused by the channeling of mana, he would then utter a few words to what was seemingly a much simpler spell, which caused a parchment of paper to materialize in one of his held up hands in a shower of golden bits of mana that coalesced together into the object. The same mana would burn some more runes into the paper before he let go of it.The paper would flutter through the air, apparently under the effect of an animation spell. It was also not affected by the time-altering spell. The paper would stick to the nearest wall before burning up, leaving a portal roughly the size of the paper in its wake. This portal would quickly expand to a circular portal about two feet in radius. Through the portal, one would be able to see an empty grassy field.The grassy field would change soon enough, however. Daedalus would turn his head to look at the elf now momentarily, \"I needed a slightly bigger area to do my next demonstration.\"\u00a0The marble reached the apex of it's trajectory, and would begin a slow downwards descent.Turning away from the elf to face the portal, Daedalus would begin channeling mana through both of his hands, no longer drawing any more runes or chanting. Instead, the magic he cast seemed to be a bit more primal in nature, and the coloration of his mana reflected it. The energy that now gathered in two glowing auras cupped in his hands as he held them up was an emerald green in color, as was the energy shining through his eyes. Inside the portal, a tree began to grow in the field, and would in no time grow to be the size of an ancient oak, standing alone in the field.\u00a0The marble continued to fall, about three-quarters of the way to the ground, it seemed the demonstration was almost over.\u00a0Daedalu's mana would change in coloration once again, turning to a bright orange that occasionally flickered to a fiery red. The energy he channeled seemed to be a bit more chaotic and the words he chanted seemed to reflect it,\"Tirm vuud emsu kera omd amarsae em om emksoms,\" he spoke, as the mana he channeled darkened in color ominously, his eyes still focused on the tree through the portal. The tree seemed to be completely unaffected, though, until Daedalus uttered the final word in the spell, \"Raraoka.\"The tree instantly disintegrated in a huge firey explosion, sending burning debris flying throughout the entire field through the portal. The shockwave did not seem to reach the two of them in the room, however. In fact, not even the sound made it through as they witnessed the silent destruction. \u00a0The marble hit the floor then, the sound of its impact marking the end of the demonstration and the end of the time spell, as the marble bounced and rolled normally after the initial contact. The portal would close as well in the same moment, and Daedalus would turn to gauge the elf's reaction then, the magical aura in his eyes and hands fading. \u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Daedalus raised one of his own eyebrows slightly.

Not that it couldn't see Jun without it but it could see her better or more specifically her magical aura. The gaze was oddly... nothing new. She might've felt a second \"pair of eyes\" staring at her from behind Keph's and this is clearly what it was.

Yes, she could sense a pull, but it wasn't a malicious pull. The creature didn't angrily hoard the magic around it. Instead, the pull was slow and steady, almost like a feeding animal. The entity seemed to need ambient magical energy in order to sustain itself. By extension, this meant that the creature wasn't as adapted to living in this realm as the other two void entities she had met, Xel'rath (who only ate things when it felt like it) and Grandma (who could actually produce magic on par with the greatest of sorceresses). Perhaps this creature, as far as void creatures go, was relatively young? A sort of void child? Maybe even an infant?

We should probably take the semi-magic elevators. I don't like stairs any more than Keph does and you might make the teleporting platforms malfunction.\" Jun lead them through a straight path between some of the bookshelves, where Rara would get a better look at some of the objects. Indeed, it wasn't just books, but scrolls, strange crystals, glyphs carved in stone, and about a dozen other types of fascinating, esoteric things. \"You can't see it from here, but sections of these bookshelves form a sort of maze. If you can sense magic it's much easier to navigate. An ordinary person might get stuck for a few minutes though. I think it's a sort of security feature.\" At the end of the path was a doorway with a brass covering, that led to a very tiny room lined with glyphs. The room was just small enough for Jun and Rara to fit in (along with a very confused and frightened little witch who magically disappeared inside her hat upon seeing the creature). \"She'll come out eventually. Anyways...\" She seemed to look up at nowhere in particular. \"Training Room B please.\"The brass gate closed, and the floor they were on lurched as they started moving up further into the tower.

Come on.\" Jun would lead them down the hallway, nodding politely to the mages who made eye contact. The mages nodded back and did not seem interested in crossing the two (Jun had a reputation among them). They stopped at Training Room B. She opened the door.\"Welp, here we are. Feel free to float around a bit.\" The room was large, about the size of a basketball court. The lower half of the walls, as well as the floors, were padded with a bouncy white material, like a gym.

Anyways, darkness is closely related a person's sense of identity, a person's uniqueness. And it's that same sense of self that drives people to find and befriend things that are, well, different, like Rara or Blackbean.

A chaos mage's magic has a unique energy that can touch all the spectrum of elements. All magic is kind of the same to them. It has something to do with a chaos mage's sense of self too. They're usually... um... very enlightened people. It's how they can talk to all the elements, if that makes sense.\" She pointed to the scroll. \"The tell-tale sign of a young chaos mage is having an affinity for light and dark simultaneously, which is otherwise very rare.\"She put her hands down. \"My grandmother was the last chaos mage. So I know quite a bit about them.\" She raised her hand and grinned. \"Don't get ahead of yourself. You're not a chaos mage. If you were you'd have a strong affinity for magic from a young age. You'd probably be throwing fireballs just out of instinct. You'd probably be even stronger than me already. But, your friend Rara seems to... how do I explain it? It eats all magic, and that weird beam it fired, it didn't seem to have any particular affinity. So I think Rara might be related to chaos energy. It's sort of a... a universal affinity.

The issue is that he could be self-centred and selfish, he had and would no doubt in the future sometimes put his interests above that of others.

Yet, he wasn't above taking unsupervised coin from that wealthy merchants, and occasionally being mischievous and using his abilities for personal gain. But Jun was being extraordinarily nice and helpful when she didn't need to so he was trying to keep his more mischievous side quiet.Seeing as the young lad was leaning on Jun and using her for support, he was close enough that it wasn't difficult to notice that brief look for... horror maybe? He gave a little frown, unsure what was wrong. It quickly vanished from her face, cause only doubt for Keph.\u00a0Now... for the question of dinner, it was truly a difficult decision! The young lad tapped his chin with his pencil, staring at Jun while he considered his options.

This script is undeniably beautiful, pleasing to the eye in a way one finds difficult to explain, its lilting, curving calligraphy gloriously elegant, while being inexplicably simple in design.Unlikely as it is, if Cassandra can read the script, she'll see that it says, \"Le nathlof h\u00ed.\" which translates roughly to \"We welcome you here.\"The mage studies it with a scrupulous eye for several moments before nodding in satisfaction and terminating the beam of light with a single, whispered word. She returns the token to Cassandra and gives the first smile since the beginning of their interaction.\"Welcome, sister,\" she lilts, \"to the Enclave of Isranian Magi. Keep that token on you at all times, it identifies us as the Order of Healers to one another. Follow.\"She beckons to Cassandra, before leading her up the massive, winding staircase that wraps about the central pillar of the tower. It must be twelve stories before they arrive at where they're apparently supposed to be, and the mage woman steps onto a ledge, guiding Cassandra through a tall pair of oaken double doors. After a few more dashes down winding hallways and labyrinthine corridors, they've arrived at a small, unassuming door of redwood marked with the same Elven script as before, and below it, the name Julane Gael.The mage woman knocks twice, and Julane's soft voice carries through the door.\"Coming!\" calls the muffled intonation, and several mysteriously loud thumps can be heard as the patter of Julane's feet approach the door. Finally, the door swings in and Julane's rudy face appears, seemingly winded but smiling, before the pair.\"Lady Winter! I am glad to see you,\" she exclaims, thumping her redwood staff upon the ground for emphasis.\"Thank you, Aetheria,\" she then says, turning to the mage woman and bowing her head in respect. The mage woman returns the gesture and scurries off, presumably to return to whatever she was doing before being put on door duty.With Aetheria gone, the Grand Healer turns her full attention to Cassandra, giving an uncharacteristically excited grin.\"Lady Winter...or should I say, Initiate Cassandra Winter, are you ready to begin your training? There is a long, difficult road ahead of you, and one that will likely be a great deal different from your life up until this point,\" she exclaims, though her voice is still its soft and soothing alto despite her obvious elation at having a new apprentice.\"I will not lie, it will be hard, and it will be dangerous, but you will learn more here than anywhere else in the world. Still, I would not blame you if you were to run away now, fly back down those steps and never look back. I hope, though, that you do not.

As soon as the pause presented itself, she had too many to ask, and had yet to decide on one when Julane opened the door. \"It's good to see you as well!\" She said brightly, grateful for a slightly familiar face. Cassandra listened intently as Julane spoke, before offering up a reply.\"My whole life I have done things the easy way. Buying or flirting my way out of any problem, no matter how trivial. This has left me with a deep sense of dissatisfaction in my own life, and I want to remedy that. I want to do something with my life, no matter how hard it is.

I am certainly glad to hear it,\" replies Julane with a bright smile. Then, her expression turns more somber and she starts to murmur an incantation in a pleasant, lilting, flowing language reminiscent of a bubbling creek or a gentle, cool summer breeze. At first, nothing seems to happen other than the Grand Healer keeping hold of Cassandra's hand for an uncomfortably long time. Then, as her chants continue, a low white glow appears upon the back of Cassandra's hand, growing slowly in intensity.The heat between their palms begins to grow as well, increasing in small increments until it's a searing, blistering heat that feels as if she's holding her hand in a fire, although if she attempts to recoil she'll find Julane's grip to be more than enough to hold her in place, surprisingly strong for such a slim woman. Julane's chanting grows in tempo, though her voice is still soft and soothing, and the glow of their entwined hands grows to such an intensity that it's nearly blinding, forcing one to look away lest the image is burned into one's retinas. Finally, it culminates in a brilliant flash, and the heat, as well as the intense light, have vanished, replaced instead by a rock hard, bulging weight between their hands. Julane finally releases her hand, which has oddly enough returned from the experience completely unscathed, cool and smooth and lacking in the second degree burns that one might expect.When Julane pulls her hand back there lies within her palm a shimmering red gemstone, somehow cut into an impossibly perfectly smooth oval shape without a single edge or blemish. The ambient light refracts in two within the stone as Julane holds it up to her face and examines it closely, rolling it about between her forefinger and thumb, casting dancing lights upon the nearby walls. After several moments of squinting and examining and rolling the gemstone about, Julane smiles up at Cassandra.\"Ruby,\" she states, matter-of-factly, \"egotistical and mercurial, quick to make both friends and enemies, but possessing potential for extraordinarily hard work and great dedication. As a focusing stone, it often presents itself to fire magi. It is...unorthodox for a healer, but certainly better than Midnight Iron or Jet.\"She presses the stone into Cassandra's hand -- it's still hot to the touch, but not so much so that it burns -- and turns about, beckoning for her to enter. Julane's study seems a lot bigger on the inside than one might think from the modest door without. Huge, towering bookcases holding all manner of scripts and tomes in innumerable languages line three out of the six walls. Across from the centre bookcase, on the opposing wall a large hearth burns brightly before a long white oak table and six red, cushioned chairs sat about the it. Two windows look out over the Free City itself, with their shimmering silver curtains drawn, and a personal desk stands before one of the windows, papers strewn somewhat haphazardly about it. A twisted redwood staff with a smooth opal stone wrapped atop it with five wooden \"fingers\" stands against the wall, waiting for its master's call.\"Sorry about the mess,\" apologises Julane as she approaches one of the bookcases, searching the tomes with an outstretched index finger.\"The next stage before you go about learning our ways is to pick your staff. Different materials and carving styles resonate with different people; your focusing stone will likely change many times as you change and grow as a person, but your staff -- assuming it doesn't somehow break -- stays with you for life.\"Julane stretches her arm out, and the redwood staff flies from its resting place and nestles itself in her palm. She turns to Cassandra and plants it in the ground.\"It's an important decision, and one that should not be made without careful consideration,\" she states, her tone teacherly, but very serious and grave. Then she turns back, and immediately finds the volume she's looking for, pulling it from its resting place in between a book about focusing stones and one whose title is in an incomprehensible runic script. She twirls about and hands it face-up to Cassandra with a smile. \"'The Comprehensive Index of Magical Materials, Wands, Spellbooks, and Staves' by Magos Dominus Bertrand Vallian of the Gheridian Empire\" it reads. It's an extremely thick and heavy book, and it doesn't exactly seem like a page-turner.\"Your first order of business,\" she states, \"is to read this from page 1201 to page 2004 -- the part about magical materials and their relevance in crafting wands and staves -- and tell me exactly what material you want to use. Then, we'll go out to wherever this material is best acquired, and we'll find it, even if it's deep within the Blackfog Mountains, in a murky swamp in some dismal valley, at the bottom of the ocean...well, you get the idea.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"Excellent!

As she died at my feet her blood began to fill etchings on the floor. Strange sigils and runes full of this woman\u2019s blood covered the floor in front of me. Pooling towards me. At this moment I could not move and was only vaguely aware of my surroundings. But once that blood touched me, it was like moving from a dark room into the light.

He stepped forwards to one of the pages and began to draw. It was if he was simply tracing an imagine it was so seared into his mind. He made no mistakes, needed no corrections. One confident stroke of the pen after another. He worked in a fever. Large sweeping lines of architecture were drawn, the great hall was quickly drawn in little over a few minutes. Once that was done, Kargth began to draw the sigils upon the floor, that is where the real work began. Kargth realised that he was able to write them with ease. It took him over a week to memorise the shapes and method of writing in common, even now he was still only a novice. But with this, it was like he always knew. He scratched their marks into the parchment delicately and with great precision. Kargth was so enraptured in his task he did not notice similar symbols begin to glow a bright red upon his armoured plating. They were brutish symbols. Made of hard straight lines intersecting in various angles and positions. Surrounding these symbols great geometric shapes were interlaced, forming maddeningly complex patterns. It took him over an hour as well as a dozen parchments to etch in the last of his memory onto the paper before him. As he placed down the pen in satisfaction the etchings upon his armour began to fade away, becoming indistinguishable to the dark metal of the plating.\u201cThere magos. That was what I could remember. The symbols feel familiar to me, I recognise that I know them, but I do not understand them.\u201d ", "link_list": ["/post/91678/thread", "/user/1909"], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/4keRNBZ.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@blankslate\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/91678/thread\" timestamp=\"1561437612\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-1909\" title=\"Daedalus\"><img alt=\"Daedalus Avatar\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/4keRNBZ.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/91678/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1561437612000\" title=\"Jun 24, 2019 20:40:12 GMT -8\">Jun 24, 2019 20:40:12 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-1909 group-0\" href=\"/user/1909\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@blankslate\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Daedalus</span></a></span> said:</div>Daedalus chuckled, \"Ah yes of course, sorry I get carried away sometimes.\"<br><br/>He set aside the map, and brought out a bunch of blank parchment.\u00a0<br/><br/>The mage pushed them forward, towards Kargth across the desk, and with a snap, a quill and ink appeared near him as well on the desk.\u00a0<br/><br/>\"There you are, use as many parchments and ink as you like, but please draw every detail you can remember.\"<div class=\"quote_clear\"></div></br></div></div>"}}
