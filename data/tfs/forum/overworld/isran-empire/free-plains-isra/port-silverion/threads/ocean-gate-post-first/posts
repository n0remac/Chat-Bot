It was a soft blue with sakura flowers embroidered on its silk. A pink obi was knotted around her waist. It was one of the last pieces that she owned. Many of her kimono's had been sold in her venture to survive in the world outside of Katashima. Even her face was left untouched by make-up, something Nakatani had been forced to get used to after the white paste she was used to applying to her face seemed to be unobtainable outside of Katashima. <br/><br/>A soft sigh left her lips as the boat came to a stop at one of the docks.

How the sun sets over the jungles and forests that surround the city, and cast brilliant colours over the shimmering, deep blue sea, there truly is nothing like it. As the twilight hours creep forward, Captain O\u2019Malley sits on a plush, cushioned lounge with her legs up on the lap of her first mate, Alaris Fontaine. Johnnie closes her eyes with a smile as she feels the slight warm breeze against her cheeks, offset slightly by the spicy taste of the red tobacco stuffed into the pipe that she cradles in her hand. \u201cWhat a night,\u201d she coos softly. The tanned-skinned elf smiles and nods in agreement, her hand resting on the captain\u2019s bare leg. After a long day, neither of the pair were interested in being out in the public eye. Both have rolled up sleeves and pant legs, coats have been discarded, and blouses loosened for comfort, choosing a relaxed, plain evening in private. Nothing would disturb them as they enjoy each other\u2019s presence on such a fine evening. Until a heavy fist knocks on the study door. Johnnie droops her head back and sighs, her eyes closed and wishing whoever it was would just disappear until the next day. But, she knew that if anyone dared to interrupt her private time, its usually important, and only a few had the balls to do it. Judging by the sound of the knock, she knew exactly who it would be. \u201cCome in, Dranarum!\u201d she yells out, a small scowl on her face. She looks to her elven beauty and lowers her voice to a mutter. \u201cThis better be important.\u201d The doors to the western study open and a stout, but hugely bearded Dranarum Hammerfist steps in, his coat as impressive as his tri corner hat. The Sea Drake\u2019s quartermaster makes his way through the study, stopping just a moment to look up at the portrait of Francis O\u2019Malley hanging over the fireplace, and out onto the balcony. \u201cFergive me, Cap\u2019n,\u201d he says with a nod of his head. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be here if t\u2019weren\u2019t of some importance.\u201d \u201cI trust you, Dran,\u201d Joanne says, crossing her legs at the knee and taking up a more casual position. She takes a moment for a pull on her pipe and nods to him. \u201cGo on, friend. Speak freely.\u201d Her words come with the red smoke of the spiced tobacco. The dwarf reaches into a satchel at his side and retrieves a sealed note, the seal unmistakably Isran in origin. \u201cA reply from the Isran Empire, Cap. I\u2019ve no\u2019 looked at it, fer obvious reasons, but I\u2019ve got a good feelin\u2019 in me gut, and its no\u2019 from Dezdamona\u2019s recent catch. Yeuch.\u201d He hands it to Alaris, who just happens to be closer, who passes it along. Captain O\u2019Malley lifts her legs and turns to put her feet on the wooden boards of the balcony, intent to read the letter properly. She lets the pipe hang from her mouth as she looks over the seal. \u201cWell,\u201d she says, turning her eyes to the two most important people in the world to her. \u201cThis may be some history right here.\u201d She opens the letter and reads. Captain Joanne O\u2019Malley, If you would like to come to speak with me, please do. I can be found in The Citadel most weekdays, and usually meet with visitors in the afternoon.Safe voyages, Signed, Empress Naoki of The Isran Empire\u201cHuh,\u201d she mutters after just a few seconds. The two look at her quizzically. \u201cOne line. That\u2019s it.\u201dAlaris raises an eyebrow while Dran nods. \u201cI like it.\u201d The Captain smiles at the pair. \u201cSo do I, quick and to the point without any of that pompous bullshit. She\u2019s a woman after my own heart.\u201d She looks at the letter over again, then frowns in realization. \u201cStone the crows. Tell the council not to waste my time making my letters more \u2018proper\u2019 ot \u2018formal\u2019. Gods that makes my skin crawl, especially when we can get away with this,\u201d she says, raising the letter. The pair just raise an eyebrow each at her. There\u2019s no way they\u2019re saying that. \u201cFine, I\u2019ll do it. Anyway, Dran, get the Drake ready to sail, and organize an escort. We sail in two days.\u201d The letter is tossed gingerly onto a small table, where two mugs of ale and an ashtray sit, and the Captain resumes her lounging state with her legs up on her lover. \u201cLoad them up with gifts, we want to make a good first impression. Wine, food, ale, artifacts, and the haul of the Trade Ship Agatha. Put Ogden in the brig too, that should curry favour.\u201d \u201cAye ma\u2019am,\u201d the dwarf barks as he salutes. \u201cHe should be more cooperative after a week in the hole.\u201d \u201cPrecisely. I\u2019m sure the Israns would be glad to get their goods back,\u201d she says as she takes a puff on her pipe once more. \u201cAnd the man that stole them. Make sure to parade him a little too, let the people see what we do with code breakers.\u201d The dwarf nods and goes on his merry way. \u201cThis is going to be a fun week, Alaris,\u201d Johnnie says as she gets comfy again. \u201cA new chapter of wealth and riches. Exciting.\u201d ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------It's a lovely day in Port Silverion, with its hustle and bustle of trade and cargo being hauled around, merchants bellowing their prices, and the distinct yelling of deckhands giving instructions. All is well in the world of commerce at the port, money is being made and goods exchanged. Massive sails begin to pierce the horizon beyond the port as five ships travel on a heading laid in for the port. The lead ship, the largest of the group, is a massive man o\u2019 war, loaded to bear, followed by two galleons and two brigantines, each moving in precision formation in a well maintained convoy.As the small fleet draws nearer, more details can be spotted through spy glasses. The sails are immaculate, fresh, and perfectly white against the morning sun, like a noble\u2019s wedding dress on the best day of her life. The flag perched atop those sails though tell a different story, a flag with a pitch black background, contrasted heavily by the pure white silhouette of a beautiful woman with a cutlass in one hand, and a set of scales in the other, the flag of O\u2019Malley\u2019s ship, one that would strike fear into old sailors\u2019 hearts from the days when it roamed their seas, taking what it wanted. At the front of the ship, among the welded and bolted iron armoured sheets and reinforcement, sits a massive iron dragon head, set at the very front of the ship as its figurehead, the prized possession of the O\u2019Malley family and their crew. The ship boasts five decks within the hull, all bristling with weapons, mostly of ballista like qualities that launch iron balls, brimstone projectiles, enchanted irons, and bolts. On the upper deck sit six catapults, each with their own armaments and ammunition, and two super heavy ballistae. At the front of the ship is the figurehead, a massive iron-clad dragon head. To some, it's just an overcompensation for something Captain O'Malley lacks, but that would be a mistake to assume.For those who look closely they would see that the rigging is covered in tattered coloured materials, the remains of the flags flown by those who challenged her and failed. As the ships approach, the brigantines break off, each splitting from the group and raising their sails, intent to watch from a distance. Soon after, the galleons do the same, leaving the Sea Drake on its own as it approaches the opening of the port, flanked on either side by the massive light houses. By now, over half of its sails have been raised, leaving just enough to coast into the port. The sounds of sea shanties being sung as the ship passes the lighthouses fills the air, songs of merry and voyages and tall tales. \u201cPrepare to weigh anchor!\u201d a voice yells over the shanty, the voice of a woman as she stands on the deck, wearing quite the impressive coat. \u201cTake \u2018er in slow, boys!\" The last of the ship's sails raise as the ship coasts into the bay, intent to find a good, open spot for the large ship to drop anchor.
