It is an unassuming and rather rundown looking storage facility owned by Phineas Lurch, its greatest asset being it is within spitting distance of the docks, ensuring the transfer of cargo to and from ships is a relatively painless affair. Perhaps making up slightly for its dilapidated appearance, the actual size of the warehouse is quite spacious, especially given the prime real estate it is built on in relation to the docks. As one would expect, the inside of the structure is almost entirely storage space, with the exception of an office located in the back corner of the warehouse. A variety of goods litter the interior of the building, ranging from imported foreign fabrics and dyes to unrefined metal ore and even some crates filled with bottles of wine. A handful of Phineas\u2019 employs are kept working at the warehouse at all times, this essential personnel included several dockworkers, a pair of guards, and a record keeper who handled all transactions in Phineas\u2019s absence.

They'd been doing the same thing all night: picking up things, then putting them back down. Gods, how she loathed the repetition! How useless such work was, without passion or want.

There were two people, one was a slim woman dressed in leather pants and a light silk shirt. Her skin was a deep olive colour and she had a woman's figure, though it was lean with muscle. Her features were fair, pert nose, dainty chin, full lips, and high cheekbones. All framed with jet black hair cut short, but long enough to show that if it was longer it would be curly. The man was, for lack of a better word, an absolute beast. He was nearly seven feet tall, with shoulders so broad that he might have trouble making it through doors. His biceps are so massive that they were almost as wide around as Maripha's waist and the rest of him reflected that musculature. His skin is pale, head shaved bald, his jaw square, his nose flat, his brow low and brutish. He could have not been more dissimilar to the woman except they had the same eyes.Dark brown, almost black, and behind them, there was an absence. It was hard to describe but when looking at the two for a moment it was more like looking at a painting of a person rather than at the genuine article. Although that may just be because they were both unnatural still and quiet, at least, at first. Then the woman is smiling and walking up to Maripha and that first impression seems to melt away as the woman seems as friendly as can be.\"You must be the new dealer. I've heard good things.\" The woman says extending her hand. \"I trust you brought our payment.\" If Maripha glanced back at the man she would note that he was carrying a satchel and the relationship becomes clear. The woman was the one who did the talking and the man was the one who carried the product... and likely dealt with any problems should they arise. A classic pairing for sure, especially int he criminal underworld where a woman could often be underestimated.

Indeed, she wouldn't want to take them in a fight; she absolutely couldn't and that was fine.\"I would hope so,\" she answered the woman. \"It was Blue Blood that pulled me into this realm. Spreading it will do me as many favors as I'll do for you,\" she told them with a sly smile. She had no need for money and tossing her a pouch filled with coins gave her no sorrow.

About eight dozen total. \"I am sure that it will do you all kind of good.\" The woman says with a deep chuckle.
