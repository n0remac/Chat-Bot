Each of the towering fifty-feet tall constructs dominates the land around the town, giving a clean vantage point of ten or more miles in all directions, save the northwest where line of sight is blocked by the high cliffs that encompass the west side of the Free Plains Bay.The towers double as watch posts for approaching land and river traffic, and as the final choke point for vessels coming down the river. A long, magically enchanted chain lies between the towers, able to be raised from the riverbed in only a few minutes by guards in stationed at the towers. Both towers are crowned by signal lights, which are used both to indicate to approaching vessels whether the chain is or is not raised, and to alert the town's military without an audible component. The chain is not raised except in emergency situations.All traffic entering or leaving Port Silverion by the Silverion River must post here before entering the city. Please post at the Free Docks next, unless you have permission to use the naval docks.All foot traffic entering or leaving Port Silverion should use either the East Gate or the North Gate!Read about Isra's border permissions here.", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1862/free-docks", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1837/east-gate-post-first", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1838/north-gate-post-first", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1809/isra-permissions"], "image_list": [], "html": "Where the Silverion River meets the fortified walls of Port Silverion, two large towers flank the river.
