Yes, I believe that this new business venture of yours seems like a very good idea indeed. I can certainly help you make contacts with the primary suppliers and importers, although capitalizing on those contacts is something that you'll have to manage on your own. I have faith that you'll be able to do all that, though. You didn't get to where you are without being able to negotiate a bargain, I'm sure.\"\u00a0His assistant frowned, scratching something into her notebook. Showpieces, toys and gifts for the rich...just more boring aristocrat stuff. Nothing worth noting after all.\"What sort of store would this be?\" asked Robert. \"Certainly you wouldn't sell spices and nightgowns on the same floor. How large do you plan to make this, really?

I intend to take up an entire city block. I will have separate buildings for the creation of certain goods within the property -- consumables, mostly, but I intend to employ my own blacksmith and jewelsmith upon the grounds. I am hoping that I might be able to employ many Israns in noble professions, and honestly, I am hoping to bridge the gap between aristocrat and commoner. That is, after all, what caused the civil war of Gauldin.\"She pulled a list from her pocket, unfolded it, then leaned forward to pass it across Robert's desk to the white-haired gentleman. \"I am most interested in getting in contact with someone from Tawakoshi or Quying.

I've worked with their silk before on gowns, but I think I would like to carry kimono, for which I know very little about.\"Those lovely lilac eyes, quietly enthused about her immediate business future, were steady on Robert's face.

An ambitious venture, to be sure...but an interesting one. That's the sort of sight that will draw people to the city, bring visitors from all manner of far reaches. If you can pull it off, it'll be an icon of the city...and I have no doubt that you can pull it off.\"He managed to tear his eyes away from hers for just a moment, long enough to scan over the list.

Have you been? I'm sure you must have.

His uncle always kept him stocked with far more chocolate than he could possibly eat, and he made a habit of giving it away to pretty women.\"My uncle makes the finest candy in all of Isra, if I do say so myself...but perhaps I'm a bit biased. In any case, I can have a message sent to Tawakoshi right away by pigeon, but it may be a few weeks before they can make it all the way down here. In the meantime, however, I would love to help you look through your inventory.

In fact, Robert did not\u00a0have space in his schedule, but she knew him well enough at this point to know that this didn't matter.
