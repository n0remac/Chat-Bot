The avenue runs south from the wall, until it meets Stark Street, just a couple dozen feet from the bank of the Silverion River. A statue of Ildesias Xen Torsal has been erected in the intersection, paying homage to the Free Plain's first leader.Several hundred feet of military and commercial dock yards and warehouses, including the Isran Navy's fortified compound and the latest Stark state-of-the-art repair and refit dry dock, separate Kistameer Avenue from the shores of the Free Plains Bay.The east side is lined with businesses, bars, and some official buildings. Stark's Inn sits at the crux of Kistameer Av and Stark St, dominating the entire block.Guards are always stationed both inside and outside of the northwest gate, and the avenue is patrolled regularly to keep the violence between rowdy sailors and dockworkers in check.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Where Norkari Hills Road meets the northwest gate, its name changes to Kastimeer Avenue, in honor of the Isran Navy's new admiral.
