But, Naoki supposes, she isn\u2019t quite the naval architect, is she? There would still (hopefully) be room in her cabin for Liz, anyway.However, what she was really looking for from Gothmog was an estimated time of departure. If they could go ahead and board now and not be in the way, or if they should wait for an hour or two more while the ship continues loading for another hour or two. Rather than asking this directly, and perhaps getting caught in a discussion she isn\u2019t quite prepared to have about the specifics of preparing a ship for departure, Naoki decides that they\u2019ll just board the damn ship. \u201cWell. Then let\u2019s go ahead. Artemis will catch up.\u201dWith a hand motion that doesn\u2019t necessarily disclude Gothmog, but isn\u2019t intended as an order in case he has other things to be doing, Naoki suggests that the group follow her as she leads the way toward the ship Gothmog identified as the Dakota. She pauses at the gangplank as two men carry some manner of crate aboard, and proceeds to follow them up onto the ship\u2019s deck. She doesn\u2019t linger at the top of the plank, instead choosing to cross directly over to an area of the deck that doesn\u2019t seem to be in the way of anyone doing anything important. Her balance seems unaffected even as the ship rolls slightly; her tail easily compensates. Once waiting for everyone to follow her up and for Skarlet to find her way to her side, Naoki begins to speak, \u201cReady for some naval education, Skarlet?\u201d Without waiting for a response, Naoki continues, \u201cLike Captain Bloodsail said, this is what they call a \u2018ship of the line\u2019.\u201dNaoki taps the deck with her toe, indicating the ship that they\u2019re currently standing on, what with its large size, and incredible armament, relative to the other vessels present.\u201c...Which sounds like a bit of funny name, considering that the ship itself doesn\u2019t seem very much like a line, but it\u2019s actually a descriptive name relating to how the ship is designed to be used in combat. You see how all along the side of the ship, there are a whole bunch of ballista, pointed outward? The idea is such so that you take a few ships like this one- the more the merrier, and line them up end to end, like ducks in a row, and then sail the whole line past whatever it is you\u2019d like dead, and shoot it to hell with all of your side-mounted weapons. Hence, \u2018ship of the line\u2019, because you use it in a line of ships. Or a line of battle. Or however else you might want to term it.\u201d\u201cWhen they\u2019re all finished, Isra ought to have seventeen of this type of vessel, as one of the primary components of the fleet. Those smaller ones down there,\u201d Naoki continues, pointing to the ship directly adjacent to their own, \u201c...those are frigate-built warships, which means that they were built with speed and maneuverability in mind. The name comes from the Prizzian word \u201cfregata\u201d, which means essentially the same thing. We\u2019re going to be using them primarily- both in this instance and in the broader sense of Isra\u2019s naval strategy, as escorts. For trade convoys and such. We\u2019ll have twenty-four of those, once all is said and done and barring any accidents.\u201dNaoki spends a moment squinting off the side before pointing off down the docks, intending to indicated one of the docked ships \u201cAnd then, way down there, you see that squarish-looking one, with only a few ballista? That ship isn\u2019t intended to fight for itself, but rather to carry griffins into battle! A carrier, if you will. Each one can carry a whole bunch of griffins like St. George here, as well as their riders and support staff. It\u2019s basically a big stable on a boat, but it\u2019s an incredible tactical asset. Can you imagine, sailing about on the open sea as an enemy of Isra, and then being set upon by a whole company's worth of armored griffin riders, riding out of the sun, spears gleaming? Because the ships, they\u2019re not equipped to fight griffins. They\u2019re equipped to fight ships; ballista don\u2019t shoot up, and griffins are fast. And even marines aren\u2019t really prepared to fight off the sheer, magnificent force that is an armored griffin with rider. The hope is that some of Liz\u2019 specially trained units will be able to land on and kill the crew of enemy vessels without significant threat of retaliation. It ought to be highly effective, and I hope to see it in action at some point.\u201dThose familiar with the cat-woman might note a hint of pride creeping into her voice as she speaks about the carriers. The idea was, at least to some extent, hers, and to see it enacted and seemingly quite promising is somewhat fulfilling.\u201cOh, and there are also schooners, these tiny ones. They\u2019re just light sailing ships with mounted weapons, really. Can carry some cargo, too. Not too much to say about them, other than they\u2019re cheap and numerous. I'm not really sure where the name comes from. We\u2019ll have a bunch of those as part of the navy, too. It ought to be a damn fine navy, once it\u2019s finished.\u201dWith that, Naoki nods solidly, mostly to herself, and concludes her impromptu lecture, leaning against the ship\u2019s railing, and keeping one ear in constant motion, monitoring the various movements and activities as the sailors prepare to depart.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "An eyebrow is raised at Gothmog\u2019s mention of an adjacent room for Liz.

Their trip had been undeniably stressful, straining her patience and body in kind, and today had no shortage of arduous tasks and annoying protocols she'd had to work through with the crew. For the first time in weeks she was free of the stink of seamen, grog, and salt, her first moments alone on solid land in weeks. She wanted nothing more than to stretch her legs a bit and unwind with something relaxing...something fun.For a sharp eyed merchant few activities were a more enjoyable time than a search for a good deal at the local markets, and Viktoriya loved to shop. Her extravagant attire was indicative of her preoccupation with expensive and beautiful things, and she was happy to be back in her typical flowing frilled dress, glittering pearl coated kokoshnik, and regal mink fur shawl. On the ship she'd been forced into simpler, more functional attire, but here she could let her fashionable wings fly. Wandering the markets would serve a second purpose to the ever efficient businesswoman: familiarizing herself with the port and the merchant stands, as well as getting her name out there just a little amongst the local market. Viktoriya had never come to Isran before, and so networking and learning the lay of the land were of urgent importance for her success here in the coming weeks. If she could work on her business ventures and have an enjoyable evening, then that was certainly the ideal. If she was lucky, she might even hit it off with a prospective business partner, surely Isran had a great number of unique products which would sell quite well back in Giant's Hand and amongst her Free Men brothers and sisters at home. The people of Isra were diverse and fantastical, even so far as the typical menagerie would expect in a conglomerate of travelers at an average port, seemingly wholly unbound by any one distinct mark of culture, race, or creed. In some ways the port reminded her of home, the conglomerate of runaways, travelers, and quacks that made up her own people. She had to fight her instinctive desire to stare as unfamiliar and odd creatures passed her on the narrow streets between the warehouses and trade guilds. As she approached the pop up markets a creature of particular peculiarity caught her interest. A lizard that stood like a man, taller than herself by some notable measure, adorned in a mosaic of plant life and fungus. It was certainly an odd look, but in spite of her guttural reactions, Viktoriya knew it foolish to discredit based solely on looks, that was an easy way to miss out on some of the best opportunities the trading world had to offer, and after all, she wasn't particularly mundane in her own appearance. Her eyes lingered on the figure as she continued forward, her unkempt Free Man translator in tow, his hair cut in a scraggled chupryna, hair damaged by sea salt, a bushy moustache accenting his slender lip. She'd forced him into something respectable, a clean black chokha with silken white gloves and polished leather boots.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "By the time they had cleared the seawall, had their cargo inspected by the Port Authority, unloaded the ship, and made contact with their buyers to arrange transport for the goods, the sun had just begun to sink the sky.

Without word she reached beneath the fur shawl that covered the upper half of her torso and drew a dagger, the khanjali. She slid the blade across her palm, her teeth grit as the fresh wound seeped blood. Vadym gave her a worried eye, and called out with a hissed \"hey!\", but a silent look from her silenced the stoic man at her side. She reached for the bottle and took a sip, watching intently for the effects to take place. Her attention split between observing her little experiment and listening to Ye'svonne elaborate on the details of his production capacity. She seemed wholly unfazed by the cut on her hand as he went on. \"I see, one hundred and fifty is far more than I had expected from a single craftsman as it was. You must really have a talent for your craft. Should we settle on that then? If possible, I'd like to return with 75 of either potion. These are the two things most sought after by soldiers, strength and endurance. I have no doubt I would sell out in a manner of days.\" she explained.\"Should we get it in writing then?\" she asked, her gaze drifting to the towering free man at her side, who seemed to understand the implication. He procured a piece of parchment and an ink pen from a belt pouch.

Emotions are easy to let get the better of us, they are our strength, and our weakness.\" she affirmed, shaking her head softly as she dwelled on the mistake of tone she had taken with the alchemist. She didn't usually let herself fly so far off the handle. Perhaps it was the stress of the trip, or the unfamiliarity with Isran.

From ship crews to sidestreet merchants, the young cephalopod was desperate for information concerning her father, and unabashed when it came to asking about it. Beyond this, she was quite the regular patron of the few stalls and stores here, unable to reach the recesses of the city due to the whole 'not being able to breath' situation. She paid well, and made herself known as a friendly and welcome patron. After all, in spite of her purpose in port being quite morbid, she was still the bubbly, easily excitable young girl she had been before the incident, drawn in by wondrous sights and interesting people with little prompting. Flann had spent the better part of the day interrogating the foreign ships that sailed in to the free docks, with...questionable results, struggling in many cases to bridge a language barrier and in fewer but not insignificant instances, struggling to keep her head as threats and hostilities were brandished at her for her unnatural qualities. She disliked this the most out of any of the new host of problems which came with being reborn as a water nymph. Before now she had been well liked, approachable, and welcomed in many of the communities she explored or called home. Now though, it was a coin toss as to whether or not she'd even get the respect to be treated as equal to someone, much less a warm welcome. She assumed this problem would only grow more severe the further she ventured from Isra, for at the very least, the Isran Empire was home to a diverse variety of people. Weary from the arduous task of information gathering, and dejected from her lack of any success, the tentacled traveler took it upon herself to relax a bit with a trip around the market's edge, bobbing up and down atop the water, just able to see high enough to meet eyes with the vendors on the edge of the docks as the waves rose and crashed gently against the sea wall. The woman moved swiftly with the roll of a wave, propping herself up on the edge of the pier, her legs dangling gently in the water. Her bulbous blue eyes scanned the scene, quickly passing over familiar stalls and semi-familiar faces, until her eyes caught on a curious sight. A trader had popped up amongst the crowds, though from the look of the cart and horse, it seemed unlikely he was one of the sea traders. Now that was interesting, while it wasn't the most uncommon to see carts and cargo caravans around the port, most of them were usually quickly moving in and out of the city, more commonly seen around the warehouses. His face seemed somewhat familiar, though the two of them had never actually spoken before. Perhaps it was time to change that. From her position on the wall it was hard to see exactly what he had in his cart, but the glittering glisten seemed to suggest it was valuables of some kind, perhaps magical artifacts among them. She tapped the bag that hung at her hip, feeling the fairly weighty coin purse within. Someone with her affinity for various tasks in the water was quite desirable when it came to hiring workers around the port, she'd made a good chunk of coin working odd jobs. Flann began shimmying her way down the edge of the docks, the tentacles on her head tightly taut, as though they strained to help her lift herself and scoot along, though of course, their positioning on her head meant they provided no real assistance to the effort. As she crept close enough to be within speaking distance to the man she met eyes with him, her bright ceruleans gently glistening in the evening sun. She gave a soft wave of her hand, hoping to further draw his attention, as approaching the cart directly was sort of out of the question for the waterbound girl.\"H-Hey there! 'scuse me but um...could I borrow a bit of yer time ser? I promise it won't take long, we could talk while I...ah, take a quick juke at your stock? I can't see too well from here but you seem to have quite a few unusual pieces, might be a treasure buried in it, ay? If not then...well...s'pose I'll give you a few copper for yer time atleast.\" she remarked, speaking in a tone just below a yell, her voice fighting to carry over the white noise of the marketplace and the gentle crash of the waves beneath her. She hoped her appeal to his wallet would take precedence over any prejudices he held towards 'sub-humans', as the more caustic were prone to calling her.

Atop its main mast sits the Libetalian flag, one that was once feared across the oceans, but it\u2019s white woman, cutlass brandished in one hand, a scale in the other, had taken on a new meaning since the island was founded, forty years prior. To old salts, it still may tug at their stomach, but to the young, it represents only a nation and the stories of old. Its crew remains busy, even after the ship had dropped anchor. Most go about cleaning the decks, singing shanties, and making ready to go ashore for their own reasons, at least those who had earned a day of leave. Longboats are lowered into the water below, along with the ladders, allowing the crew to get to shore without leveraging the Drake into a pier. First on the longboats is the Captain\u2019s procession. Standing at the end of the boat is Captain Johnnie O\u2019Malley, wearing a fancy, perfectly maintained white coat with a dark yellow trim and a leather collar that stretches over her shoulders. Underneath, she wears a white shirt and a dark green corset that matches her trousers. Around her waist, a belt with a large buckle, the clasp shaped like a parrot\u2019s wing, the leather matching both her gloves and her boots. With her shirt open at the top, her tattoos are revealed, a fancy choker crosses her neck, and the tattoo of an amulet sits across her chest in a matching style.Clasped at once side is a large, jewel encrusted, ceremonial looking cutlass, while at the other a more practical looking weapon, but nonetheless impressive with its golden guard and respectably plain leather sheath. Her hair is brushed and tied back behind her head, which is quite different for the so-called pirate queen, but today is a day worth making the effort for. With her hair out of her face, and without her usual eyepatch, her pretty face is clear as day, with her high cheek-bones, chiseled jawline, and confident smirk. Though good looking, her face is still blemished by four claw scars that cross her right eye, scars that she wears with pride. She\u2019s joined by her first mate, Alaris Fontaine, a gorgeous elven woman with tanned skin, black hair, and an aura of elegance that betrays the simple shirt, trousers, and sandals that she chooses to wear, and perhaps even more notably Iron Bill, an almost golem-like creature, encased in thick metal armour and emanating a dull orange light through the opening of his helmet. Over his shoulder is a harpoon attached to a long chain that disappears into an opening in his armour. Of course a \u2018queen\u2019 isn\u2019t without an armed escort. Behind the duo of Johnnie and Fontaine are some of her best men, all in a uniform of a long, good looking coat, fine but functioning boots, and a fancy ruffled shirt, though they all take different shapes. Two Northlander men and a woman, with their heights and broad shoulders, a pair of Dwarves, only about half the height but just as broad, a cheeky looking sea-nomad Av\u2019, with his shirt open, horns swept back, and a mischievous grin on his face, and a pair of humans to make up the rear guard. Finally, the longboat, followed by another handful loaded with goods for trade and sailors for leave, approach many of the long piers that make up the docks. Being the leader that she is, O\u2019Malley is the first up the ladder and onto land, a long smile across her lips. Isra doesn\u2019t seem as bad as she remembered, and definitely not as bad as some of her people like to make it seem. The sun is shining, the people are busy, and there\u2019s trade to be made. That meant, above all things, money and prosperity. At least that\u2019s the hope.Once her entourage is on land and taking in the sights, the woman peers around for a sign post or guard. She didn\u2019t expect any sort of welcome party, she didn\u2019t much care for that sort of thing, but she did want to get down to business. Finally, the captain spots a bored looking guard. \u201cMorning,\u201d she says as she approaches, followed only by Fontaine and Bill. Her guards watch on, but otherwise seem relaxed. \u201cCaptain O\u2019Malley, Libertalian Admiralty.\u201d Read: big boss bitch. \u201cNeed you to point out the directions to the Citadel, I\u2019m expected to see your Empress.\u201d She rests a hand on her cutlass and gives the guard her best winning smile.

She doesn\u2019t see, as the curtains are drawn, but she hears them. Naoki listens intently as they pass through the gate, ears up and swiveling. She hears the clip-clop-clip-clop of horseshoes on cobblestone, certainly, but of more interest to her are the other sounds \u2014 or lack thereof. They pass what she knows to be a busy market, but hear nothing. Not the usual cacophony of noise and hollering of a market, not clapping and cheering, nothing. Outside, everyone has paused what they\u2019re doing to watch the carriage pass. It\u2019s not wholly silent, a few are bold enough to clap, but you're not supposed to be able to hear the gulls.Naoki frowns. This silence says a lot about how her people perceive her, and she doesn\u2019t like it. It would probably help if she were visible and waving, but she doesn\u2019t want to embarrass Keph. Support is stronger in the city, but out here it seems as though she is feared more than she is loved.The smell of seawater grows stronger by the minute, and it isn\u2019t long before they reach the Naval dockyards. Now out of the public eye, Naoki opens the curtains and slides over to better see the ships as they pass by outside. There are the single-masted schooners, the larger frigates, and the larger-still Ships of The Line, taller than a house and brimming with ballistae. They pass by rows upon rows of ships; more piers are occupied than not. Only a small portion of the Imperial Navy\u2019s vessels are at sea, and the rest are here collecting barnacles.But at the far end of the dock, The Depravity puts them all to shame. It is comically large in comparison to all the other vessels, dwarfing even the Ships of the Line with its incredible bulk. Four piers are necessary for the mammoth vessel: one high and one low on both sides. It would be troublesome to try to count all of the masts, and one can only guess how many ballistae the ship could sport in times of war, upwards of a hundred, certainly. Though today The Depravity sits silent, a sleeping giant.On the next pier over, in The Depravity\u2019s shadow is moored The Indulgence, which \u2014 though much smaller \u2014 hardly seems modest in comparison. When compared to the ships around her, The Indulgence is a golden apple amongst potatoes. Though the other vessels are not necessarily dirty or in disrepair, The Indulgence, with its spotless red paint, pristine white sails, and extensive gilding, projects the very essence of opulence. Millions of gold must have gone into its construction; The Indulgence is entirely unapologetic about being the finest and by far fanciest example of naval engineering in the seas.As promised, most of the preparation is already done. The sails are ready, the crew has boarded, and the carpet has been rolled down the gangplank. Only the cooks have yet to board \u2014 they\u2019re off to one side, panicking that their delivery hasn\u2019t arrived yet.Mere moments after the carriage stops, the footman places stairs for her majesty to exit.

His eyebrows bouncing up-and-down as he went about lost in thought. While his feet followed Naoki, his head decided to enjoy the clouds a little longer.\u00a0When he spotted one of the Empress' many servants, he raised a finger and then a quill. Both briefly lowered in a moment of uncertainty, before again raising with a tid bit more of that certainty.\u00a0\u300cCould he get Keph a small basket of apples?\u300dIt felt odd to have the power to order people about. He considered calling the servant back, but it was far too late, as he immediately made pace to appease the Empress' guest in hopes of remaining in her good will and unluckily, the lack of eyes on the back of one's head would make any desperate writings as effective as his voice.He sighed. A pit formed in his stomach, luckily he'd soon get to fill it.Keph sped up his walk, catching up with Naoki, and walking by her side. This was better, right? Walking by her side as opposed to chasing after her, that was a lot more dignified of him. He quickly realizes he might be overthinking this too much - Naoki (and unluckily other women) had that effect on him - but soon even this thought is up for debate.\u00a0As an excessive amount of argument rages in the Council of Kephs (located deep within the young man's mind), they reach the carriage, waiting for him is a few servants with that basket of apples. They look out of breath, no doubt from the hurry they were put through. The basket is delivered to Keph, the council of mini-hims in his mind are put at ease, and with all being well, he steps into the carriage with Naoki.=========///=========The bumpy ride doesn't perturb him much. He was used to travelling in far worse conditions than these. Ironically, he doesn't make much conversation, the fruit apparently providing him with sufficient company.Keph manages to miss the subtle lack of sound within the busy marketplace. His hands maneuvering around the curtains to chuck out apple stumps, their flesh having been brutally ripped away. From the outside, all the crowd would see was a man engorging himself in the pleasures of the elite, although the little clothing they'd seen from his arm lacking the usual luxurious textiles that noblemen tended to adorn.With the sudden halt of the carriage, Keph is reminded of where he is. His eyes wandering, mind somehow having forgotten about Naoki and their date. How rude of him. He peers into the basket, only a single apple remained, which he hastily offered to the Empress with an embarrassed smile. Taken or not, he follows her lead out of vehicle.His eyes go wide and mouth agape at the splendor of some of Isra's ships. Back home, the biggest you could find is your average longboat, and even those could take months to build.
