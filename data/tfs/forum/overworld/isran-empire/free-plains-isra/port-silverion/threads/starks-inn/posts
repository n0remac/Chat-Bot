One, an old crumbling piece, covered in jottings and marks as obscure as they had been the first time Henry lied his eyes on it. With a conceding sigh he tucked it away again. The second, was a more recent piece, some sort of notice. \"Redbeard.\" - Henry thought - \"What a cliche name\".

Like what a captain should have for his crew, such a face could go a long way to bring a crew from morale crisis. As he sits on the floor with his legs crossed, he places his axe down, making it stand straight up, standing by his side. He takes in a deep breath and lets it out with a heavy sigh. Now waiting for people to join his crew. He looked around the bar as he placed his heavy hands onto the table. They were so heavy in fact, you could hear the table creaking and about to break from the sheer weight of his force. As he waited, he looked around before pointing towards his table. \"How about bringing me a keg of some good beer!\" He shouted with an excited but old and deep voice. Almost hard to hear what he said properly if he weren't so loud.

Seems there was someone new who wanted to join his crew, finally. This man seemed most certainly interesting by the looks of it. It helped that he brought a dead squirrel before him like it was a mere toy to play and mutilate. He waited patiently and listened to the man's introduction. Fixing himself as he gives him a raised eyebrow, grunting a little bit as he moved himself into a better position after sitting so long in one spot. He breaths heavily as smirks wide, showing his yellow teeth. Seems they had something in common, that's for sure. \"Bahaha!\" He laughs out as his smirk turned into a smile. Watching as Windfeld revived the squirrel before him. So he was a necromancer who had nothing better to do. He gives a small chuckle as he rests his hands onto the table as he looks down at him. Taking the knife off the squirrel and grabbing it before it could escape. He placed it on his hand and started to turn it slowly into a fist, locking it into place. As he took a deep breath and spoke.\"Age does not matter, as long as you know how to hold weapon, know what ye are getting into than you have a high change of getting accepted into the crew.\" He says as he presses harder on the squirrel, making it unable to move and harder for it to breath. His smile turning back into a menacing grin. \"I bet ye have some tricks up her sleeves. But first; Some questions.\" He says as he now completely closes his fist, crushing the squirrel, as blood starts to run down his hand and onto the table. \"Tell me. What does it mean to ya to be pirate?\" He starts off at first as he waits for his answer before giving him another question. \"What is a captain to ya?\" He asks, waiting once more before giving him one last question. \"Any other reason why I should pick ya out of everyone else?\"", "link_list": ["/post/74958/thread", "/user/2628"], "image_list": ["//storage.proboards.com/6046952/avatar/DFBXBDpphoNPiECWuLUm.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@windfeld\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/74958/thread\" timestamp=\"1509561801\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-2628\" title=\"Windfeld 'Sea-shrieker'\"><img alt=\"Windfeld 'Sea-shrieker' Avatar\" src=\"//storage.proboards.com/6046952/avatar/DFBXBDpphoNPiECWuLUm.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/74958/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1509561801000\" title=\"Nov 1, 2017 10:43:21 GMT -8\">Nov 1, 2017 10:43:21 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-2628 group-0\" href=\"/user/2628\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@windfeld\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Windfeld 'Sea-shrieker'</span></a></span> said:</div>\"There's not much to mistake here.

Before letting out his laugh and slams his fist onto the table. \"Bahaha! I like this kid! Bold and funny!\"\u00a0\u00a0He exclaimed as he wraps his big arm around the barrel of beer and pulls it towards him before pushing away the stein of beer that was for him. Smirking as he explains in his deep cold voice. \"That pathetic mug can't even fill my thirst! There is a reason I ordered a whole barrel of beer and not some tiny mug. This whole barrel isin't enough to make me drunk!\" He explained proudly and laughs once more as he lifts up the barrel, drinking from the hole Drake made, chucking for a whole minute without a pause. Once he was done, he took a breather and stroked the foam away from his mouth. \"Yer are right about that for sure, kid.\" He starts off with and leans forward, breathing heavily as he looks him dead in the eyes. \"But ya are going to have to answer my questions and prove yerself before ye get a position.

His smile waned a bit hearing that his little show wasn't enough, but feeling like the guy in front of him was in a playful mood too, he decided it could do no harm. <br><br/>\"You're looking for answers why I'd go on a boat with you and plunder places? I suppose you're the guy who likes to pick your own privileges. Me on the other hand just like to explore and see the world! It's like an inner journey of peace.\" he said keeping a plain face before bursting into a rusty laughter slamming his palms into the table. \"Haha! I bet you're not fooled that easily huh? Well have a look at this... but please don't paint the table with its entrails...\" Windfeld said as he reached down and opened a bird's cage, as a parrot promptly flew up and landed on his left shoulder. \"It's eyes are dull and its feathers tattered by years without nourishment. His name is Aberu and he's a bit special in his own way, but that's a another thing altogether.\" he said and stroked its lifeless body. \"I like finding things, killing it, and then see if I can make it move again. Squirrels aren't really that interesting, but in other regions there are creatures that really pique my interest. In fact I find many things interesting that other people find repulsive, why this way of living is what I chose. Thus I am not interested in your part of the treasure or your ship, although I know my way around such a pram having sailed since I was seven years old.\" he said and grinned. \"Do you find my ways repulsive Mr. Anderson?\" he asked with a wry smile. <br/><br/>\"More questions still? I am too old to sit here and lick your salty boots by telling you how highly I value you as a captain.\" Windfeld said slightly displeased. \"A captain is merely the one who sets the course on the big boat and claims most of the treasure while never sweeping the deck. Good enough for me though..!\" he said and chuckled. \"But forget about picking me as one of your deck rats. I'm to old and grumpy for that, you'd serve me to the sharks in no time.\" he said and leaned back in the chair. \"I propose you make me first mate instead. My experience in sailing far outweighs the strength I can put into manual labor anyway. Also I give slackers a pretty damn nasty gaze if I have to!\" he said and pushed his eye patch to away revealing an ice blue left eye that seemed almost otherworldly in its hue. \"Most of all though, you should hire me because I'd make an excellent figurehead with my winning smile!\" he said and grinned wide again. <div class=\"quote_clear\"></div></br></div></div>"}, "post-75029": {"user": "Windfeld 'Sea-shrieker'", "user_num": 2628, "timestamp": "1509694800000", "message": "\"Well it is true that you cannot separate the head from the body without some... serious consequences!\" Windfeld chuckled thinking back of one of his many experiments.

He says with his deep and cold voice, having a snicker in between the words.\u00a0\"Now that's an interesting question, have ya killed? You make it sound like it's something special to kill someone.

To Henry, it felt like ages, before a familiar\u00a0voice, sourceless, came to his ears.\"Thou yond swallow the waves and crawl the depths, feed mine hunger as thou draweth breath and I shalt release thou from the binds of death.\"The ringing of the deep voice still in his ears, he felt a powerful shove on his back that brought him to his senses. He was still in the room, the old man was talking to Redbeard, the sound muffled and distant. Henry's earing taking a few seconds to re-focus on the words - \"To be a captain?\" - Henry thought.\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes!\" - he put his hand on the table as he spoke, breaking eye contact with Windfeld turning to Red Beard - \"The Captain needs to be respected, or there is no order. And feared, or there is no restraint. You set the rules, you make the plans, we execute.\" - Henry raises a finger pointing towards the ocean outside these walls as he speaks - \"I sail the seas because staying inland, would be a prison to me. I would welcome death out there if it came to my door, for it would mean I had died free.\" - he thought for a second, and then said in false old man voice - \"We who travel the sea of freedom, are bound only by the laws of ship and ocean.\" - he ended the quote with a mocking pride. - \"An old fisherman told me that. Older than you.\" - pointing at Windfeld\u00a0- \"I don't look for justice or heroics. Give me gold to spend and my name on a bard's song, and I'll die happy.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After that wonderful joke of his, he calms himself down, now turning his brown old eyes to him, staring right at him with a smile. \u201cYer darn right about that! I like this kid! For someone who\u2019s so young, ya sure know respect! Bahaha!\" He says proudly as he slams his fist into the table, grabbing the barrel of beer and drinking the rest of the barrel. It didn't even seem that he had even taken a sip, he was still the same.\"We are far from hero's of the sea. We aren\u2019t the damn armies of this world that keep their own idea of justice. We are the Sea Giant from below, the Sea Giant who will eat anyone alive who tries to mess with us. Murder and plunder those we desire and bring some good old chaos into this world. That\u2019s what it means to be a Sea Giant pirate.\u201d He explains as he slowly lifts himself up, the floors creaking under his heavy weight and knock on the ceiling as he hit his head on it. Now standing straight with his axe by his side. His eyes glimmering with murderous intent. \u201cWelcome to the crew boys. We gonna be sailing for some blood and gold. How does that sound?\u201d He says finally as he gives a final and hideous smirk.\u00a0", "link_list": ["/post/75048/thread", "/user/2628", "/post/75069/thread", "/user/2624"], "image_list": ["//storage.proboards.com/6046952/avatar/DFBXBDpphoNPiECWuLUm.jpg", "//storage.proboards.com/6046952/avatar/bRtRwfgnRTYmNTRsZYVR.png"], "html": "<div author=\"@windfeld\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/75048/thread\" timestamp=\"1509741694\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-2628\" title=\"Windfeld 'Sea-shrieker'\"><img alt=\"Windfeld 'Sea-shrieker' Avatar\" src=\"//storage.proboards.com/6046952/avatar/DFBXBDpphoNPiECWuLUm.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/75048/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1509741694000\" title=\"Nov 3, 2017 12:41:34 GMT -8\">Nov 3, 2017 12:41:34 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-2628 group-0\" href=\"/user/2628\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@windfeld\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Windfeld 'Sea-shrieker'</span></a></span> said:</div>\"You'd be surprised just how much fun you can have with just a single freshly killed lad or lass. Numbers aren't the determining factor... basically they all become pretty much the same after their mind passes.\" he said and smirked as he started lighting up and old tobacco pibe which ebony body was carved as a somewhat grim looking humpback whale. \"... Well actually to be more precise... a human who has just died rarely loses their mind completely when told to stand again. Their shock of seeing themselves clad in unfeeling dead flesh can be rather amusing, if you ask me. So yes, you could say I had a slightly preference towards awakening humans.\" he said with a wry smile as he pulsed on the pipe as it made a faint wheezing sound. <br><br/>\"A medic you say..?\" he said feeling the same time both surprised and confused. \"Using that word to describe the things I do is such a grotesque distortion of reality, captain.\" he said with a serious demeanor before reverting to a jesting smile. \"There for I'd like to call myself that, with your permission! Yes, Dr. Windfeld Sea-shrieker. A medic. At your service..!\" he said and chuckled as he politely lifted his hat to imitate the character of a medic. \"But you seem like you appreciate a concise answer too. So yes, I can in fact keep people alive who shouldn't be alive - though that squirrel is beyond me...\" he commented and smirked as he nodded towards the bloody peace of goo that was once a living rodent. \"Some times revival in the necromantic way is better used on the organs only instead of the body as a whole.\" he said with a twisted smile, that revealed a troubled pain. \"I'd have to say though, that the medicine required to sustain a functioning dead organ within a living body is quite... vile.\" he said and leaned back with his hands behind his head. \"But the benefits are easy to acknowledge once you realize that a knife to the heart is no more enough to stop you.\" he said and seemingly looked as if he was thinking back a long time. <br/><br/>Brigthon Anderson seemed to have turned his foul gaze at the boy, and Windfeld observed him from the corner of his eye. Such a young boy, his aura practically emitting fear. Just as he had done himself so many years ago when facing his first real pirate captain.<br/>\"Boy... can I ask you a question? If ya are going to be a navigator, I'd like to know the answer.\" he said with a stern gaze, still learning on his chair. \"Are ya running away from someone? Or... something? The captain can't use a navigator who sets the course according to whatever is chasing him.\" he said as he opened the eye patch revealing the blue eye behind it. Anyone looking into would feel the same unnatural and otherworldly sensation that seemed to stifle ones breath but keep them fixated through the eye contact, feeling as if you were sinking deeper into its grasp the more you tried to get away. One way to escape was through exerting immense willpower while another was for someone else to force Windfeld to break his eye contact with the subject. Either way, if the boy answered truthfully, he would let the eye patch slide in front of his eye again. <br/><br/>However he wasn't the only one asking the questions, and Red Beard seemed hell bend on getting the right answers for his too. Only his foul breath must have made it difficult for many people to even open their mouths in his presence. But luckily Windfeld was used to this odor of death. <br/>\"A pirate is one who sails the water like the undead walks the land. Without remorse, without hesitation and knowing this body is already dead. The body have already been handed over to the deep blue palm of the sea goddess.\" Windfeld said with rare serious expression. \"To be a captain is to embody these truths to the fullest. When I saw you walk in here... when I see you chug that barrel of bear... when I smell that horrible breath of yours... I believe ya are such a man!\" he said with a faint wry smile as he leaned forward. \"And ya should pick me because pirate likes sailing with one of their own. Makes their fate seem just a little less ill.\" he said with a voice that seemed to express the hardships of his many pirate travels before emptying another cup of beer. <div class=\"quote_clear\"></div></br></div></div>"}, "post-75218": {"user": "Windfeld 'Sea-shrieker'", "user_num": 2628, "timestamp": "1510347655000", "message": "The red bearded colossus moved in close and his deep breath almost stifled Windfeld's pibe pushing him to huff harder to keep the tobacco burning. A wry smile slowly crept up on his face hearing the huge pirate's twisted ways of abusing his victims for his own good - and probably pleasure too. \"Haha, I say we do whatever we like with those so unfortunate to cross our path!\" he exclaimed as his face lit up in excitement. \"I haven't been this excited for a long, long time captain! For one I'm looking forward to spending many cruel and twisted years in your service!\" he said and gave the boy a sidelong glance. It was all giggles and fun with this guy, but somehow something had helped him break free of his 'eye', that only few could muster the willpower to do. There was something interesting about this one - something that at least told him that making him a walking flesh shield was not the most interesting use of him. \"Hahaha! You'll need no appointment with this doctor - he'll come to you!\" he said and laughed as he slapped his belly. \"Normally I would say, that you would probably regret it, but hearing how you recruit your dogs on deck I wonder if you'd find my treatment somewhat amusing..!\" he said and grinned. \"Indeed it will be on me if they die - I will take the honor of that. But I promise you, that we will not lose manpower just because they die!\" he said and fiddled with his amulet. \"Oh I can be nasty with very little to work with I guarantee that!\" he said and chuckled hearing the guy's joke. \"Doctor Windfeld 'Sea Shrieker' will keep a good eye on everyone..! Or was it the bad one? We'll see! Hahaha!\" he laughed along with Brighton. His own laugh was thinner and more piercing than the captain's deep and rumbling laugh that was more akin to massive waves crashing onto the deck in stormy whether. But it was by no means a merry laugh that came from Windfeld, rather it was cold as the night and void of compassion as the echo of the hammering of nails into the coffin of your enemy. Brighton's last words made Windfeld laugh even harder as he leaned back. \"Hahahaha!!!\" he said and even dropped his pibe in sheer amuzement. \"Yes!!! This is how it's supposed to be! Let's leave this peace of dirt and make for where ever the smell of blood and lust for gold takes us!\" He said and pointed at the mush that was once an undead squirrel. \"We even have a fitting mascot!\" he jested and looked at the boy again before speaking more muted. \"Now don't you go disappoint me. You're one of the few that made me think you'd be more useful alive than dead. Don't go disprove me huh? Or the doctor will treat you real good!\" he said with a wry smile before flashing another grin.

When I first saw the bottle on the beach I had thought for sure that it had never made it past the surf. Surely some divine presence has helped us communicate. I will risk sending this letter by courier. There is a chance it will be intercepted, but I now trust that luck is on my side for once.<br/><br/>A quest for immortality?!? That is truly the most audacious and exciting adventure I have heard of. In the stories, such desires are often met with unexpected sorrow and consequences. What drives you to such an end? I cannot comprehend but I wish I could partake in such an adventure. <br/><br/>Yet I fear that my stepfather will never release me. As soon as I am wed the king will have committed his only wagger for the throne. He has begotten no children from my mother yet, therefore he has no heir to the throne other than his hold on me. Until his own sons are born I will be passed from suitor to suitor in order to make the lords think that I might be given to one of them. I cannot actually be wed to anyone for then that house would have a chance of putting their own children onto the throne through me. As you can see I am put a piece on a board to all concerned. You speak of a remedy, but unless you have an army to take over an entire nation it would not be possible. Even then, I would not wish for such a war. Better that I live a captive then let the entire nation suffer for my freedom. The tales of your exploits will be enough to keep me happy.<br/><br/>Gorian is part of an island chain to the west of Isra. The trip would only take a few days. If you do send a letter of courtship you must convince my father of its authenticity. He reads everything that is sent to me. Please tell me more about your adventures.
