Painted in the brightest white and decorated with sigils and patterns in Isran crimson, the highly visible wall juts just over twenty feet out of the waters at high tide and almost thirty at the low.Any ship approaching from the southern seas will see the alabaster wall, marking lights, and north lighthouse gate tower well into the distance. As the ship approaches, ballistae set into the wall every thirty feet will become visible. These ballistae are constantly manned and have magical and non-magical payloads that can be delivered within a quarter minute of spotting an enemy. The local sea area is heavily trafficked and the chances of a craft slipping through undetected by the ship-of-the-line patrols is slim to none.Any sea traffic wishing to enter Port Silverion's man-made bay must do so through The Ocean Gate.", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1836/ocean-gate-post-first", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1836/ocean-gate-post-first"], "image_list": [], "html": "Spanning the distance from the shores just south of the Silverion River to the south side of the "}, "post-42996": {"user": "Deep Blue", "user_num": 1690, "timestamp": "1467425934000", "message": "Just past noon along The Seawall, a mass migration event of seabirds along The Seawall could be witnessed.
