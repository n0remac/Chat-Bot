In many ways they are similar to the mounted archers, except they use magic instead of a bow.Riding while gathering mana for spells is a skill only a few select people can master, and as such the mounted mages are highly revered. These men and women usually are highly skilled elemental mages, and use their mounts to position themselves to where they can launch high speed blasts of fire, ice, lightning, water, rock, and even acid.Often times the Mounted Archers and the Mounted Mages share mounts, learn animal husbandry together, and go on joint exercises together.

The mages had been notified before hand, and many were present. Ralakor arrived without his large party, except for the diplomat Yerazin who followed close behind and a wagon drawn by two skeletal horses.The two undead approached within a few meters of the mages, some of the wizards where on their horses, while others stood. As Ralakor stopped, a mere three meters away, he waved his arm slowly, signalling them to come closer. Slowly and awkwardly the battle mages created a semicircle around the overlord. Many of the horses refused to come any closer, leading to a few mages annoyingly dismounting and walking closer on foot. Nodding once slowly in approval Ralakor reached out into their minds and began his teachings. \"I have come to teach you on how to effectively deal with the puppets of the beast. I fear, that our awakening has also brought the shards of the creature back into light, and so, it more likely try and regain its strength, the most effective way it has done this is by bargaining with the living into servitude in return for immortality. These people are not undead, so many of your spells will not work on them. Yet these unfortunate slaves also have many of the characteristics of the undead.\" Ralakor turned around to face Yerazin, a mute second was passed, Yerazin slumped his head and walked slowly forward, infront of Ralakor. He raised his arms, facing the crowd. Ralakor then summoning a blade from wispy shadows from within himself, stabbed Yerazin through the rib cage. With the point of the sword pointing out his chest, thin wisps of shadow coming off the black blade Ralakor again faced the crowd. Yerazin put his arms down and began to slowly turn on the spot.\"As you can see,\" Ralakor gestured to the now spinning diplomat, \"Blades are of little effect on the undead, in this case, because there are no organs to puncture. In the slaves however, the body regenerates so fast that the blade wound is effectively useless. The same goes for burning, even dismemberment will not stop them for long, as the piece will soon reattach to the body, fully healed. That is what makes them so powerful. They may come at you with nothing but their bare hands but they will take you down slowly.\"He waved at Yerazin, the shadowy sword unsolidifing into the shadowy form once again, where it then leaped onto Ralakor and was absorbed back into his chest.\u00a0\"This is why you are the most effective. Although you cannot kill them, you can slow them down or trap them. A freezing spell is effective, as well as a snare of some sort. It will not kill them, but it will let you accomplish your goal. Another, more straight forward way is complete incineration. They will eventually reform from this as well, but it will take time, let me reassure you.\"He once again turned to Yerazin, who nodded at him and began to walk slowly towards the wagon. Where he flung a tarp that had covered the content from the environment off and onto the ground.\"To help you learn the best way to defeat them, I will be giving you a target that will act and look just like them.\"Intoned Ralakor as he waved his hand flippantly. Behind him the contents of the wagon flew out, and fell on the ground a few meters away. Ten separate piles of human bones where neatly placed on the ground in a row. His arms outreached Ralakor slowly raised his hands upwards, as he did the bodies behind him began to rise from the earth. As they formed into their actual shapes Ralakor quickly moved his hand from one side of his body to the other, pointing at the now standing skeletons. Shadows leaped from his finger into the waiting dead. Slowly, the black shadows completely covered them, the white bleached bones no longer showing. Ralakor made a fist with the pointing hand, and suddenly the shadows condensed in the shapes of ten different people, flesh, clothes, and all. \"They do not look like they are under any curse. But I assure you, they have no control over themselves. Now let me see how you deal with them.\" ", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The following day after the speech, Ralakor began his tour around the the city, the mages training grounds being the first of places he wished to visit.

First was the ice blasts, a tactic that the enemy had used on them in the great war and was just as effective. As the psuedo slaves's feet where frozen, the creatures would simply pull with so much force as to dismember their feet from their legs. Where they began to hobble forward on stumps. Next came the earth traps. Ralakor watched in amusement as the mages fired of the snare. Massive spikes grew from the ground and impaled the first few hobbling targets. They hung there, the spike inserted straight from below and in some cases exited out of their open jaws. As the second rank began to advance slowly, hobbling along the impaled targets began to wiggle and twitch. Slowly pulling themselves out of the spikes, it took time but slowly the began to free themselves. Finally came the sticky blast. This was something that Ralakor had not seen before, and he wondered how it would work. As it fired into the group, the green tar like substance covering the ten slaves. A faint sizzling feeling could be made out, it slowly buried through the skin of the dead and began working on the muscles below. It was taking its time though. The regenerative qualities slowing down the process remarkably.Yet they continued to advance, much slower now then when they began, but still a threat. Ralakor nodded his head in approval, they were slowing them down that's for sure but the creatures where still coming.

A strange hissing sound could be heard, but nothing would be seen.\"Fire Art: Fire Stream!\" A jet of fire shot out from the staff of the third mounted mage towards the whirlwind. It was then that Ralakor would understand. The second mage had released a highly flammable gas into the whirlwind, which was then ignited.The wooshing sound was deafening, and the flames were blinding. Instead of an invisible whirlwind, the bones would be completely engulfed in a whirling blue torrent of fiery destruction.This combination was one of the Legendary Chaos Mage Lynx's signature attacks, though she was capable of doing it by herself in her prime.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The mounted mages re-positioned themselves in formation ahead of the advancing troops.

My father rules the realm and told me the history of our home. We used to have a different form, our bodies and our world. They were similar to your own, made of flesh and blood, and the world was one mass. We were a prosperous people who lived in a utopia. My father witnessed when it all changed and is the only one who remembers it completely. Across the dimensional ley lines, we felt the effects of a war in the Overworld. Ages ago, there were multiple armies battling for control of your realm, and through the crossroads where our dimensions touch, we were able to watch. The war had gotten so far that every side began to use more tremendous and horrifying tactics. They caused massive destruction and killed many. Eventually the arms race between them went so far that their Magi cast terrible spells to destroy their enemies. Each attack would be stronger in response to the last, until two mages put together the most powerful of magicks and threw them at each other. The combination of both of their massive destructive spells created an explosion the likes of which you all have never seen, and I hope you never will. The explosion caused a Cataclysm that killed everyone for miles, there was not a single person left representing the armies to continue the war, and it created a great scar on the world.This Cataclysm did not only affect you though, the raw magical power rippled out across every dimensional tear between our realms and overlapped and echoed, destroying my world completely. My father watched as the world crumbled he and everyone he used to know was scattered into dust. Eventually, as nothing but a soul, he would create a new form like mine and assist other lost echoes of our kind make new bodies. None of us remember though, we are just echoes of a lost world. My father hates the overworlders for their irresponsible use of magic, for destroying everything he knew. I believe though your people are capable of restraint.
