Ease into it; it'll feel like home in no time.  At least you have the forests nearby,\" Konrad pointed over at the forests at the edge of the farmlands.Kamoa gloomily looked over at the woods.  \"Perhaps.\"  He sighed, tired from the tour that Konrad had just given him of the stone castle, but he was also home-sick; being out of his native forests, and here in the great wide open felt uncomfortable.  The Chataugau was a peaceful, creature-loving tribe found within remote forests of the Expanse, mostly separate from the rest of the tribes.  They could communicate with beasts of the wild to help them in their daily lives and in combat.  The tribe was under constant threat of hostile tribes who lived further in the woods, and so adopted a warrior-like ethos to defend themselves.And that was exactly why Konrad had chose Chieftain Kamoa.  Kamoa was a warrior; Kamoa had led warriors; Kamoa had victories, and he had defeats; he loved his people, and he would do whatever he had to do to defend them.  It was all the qualities of a knight - and being that Kamoa was a chieftain, he had the skills of a leader.  Finally he would be able to commune with the warhorses.  These traits made him the perfect candidate.  Konrad decided that Kamoa could retain his political status as chieftain, and he could return back to his tribe soon; for now, however, he had volunteered to head the Knights of the Harvest - just for a while.Konrad turned to get back on his white horse.  \"I trust you, Kamoa.  Some of my own Knight-Brothers will stay behind to train anyone willing to become Knights of the Harvest.  Good luck,\" Konrad saluted Kamoa and turned to leave.\"Goodbye, good friend,\" Kamoa said to him and watched him go.

His family loved him, but he would get scolded all the time for his aggressiveness.

It was followed by the loud, unwelcome yells of commanding officers: a group of 5 Knight-Brothers stationed here temporarily to train the new recruits.  \"Let's go, let's go, get up!  Let's gooooo!\"  Their bare swords banged and clattered on their shields as they stomped through the barracks, giving the new recruits a rude awakening.  \"Courtyard, let's go!\" they yelled.  Rohak of the Dittany had his own quarters, but the Brothers did not hesitate bothering him too and rudely forced him down to the courtyard; Kamoa was no exception, and they shoved him down to the yard as well.When the recruits were herded to the courtyard the Knight-Brothers took wooden poles and, rudely, pushed the recruits around until they fell in line.  Those who didn't have their feet cocked the right way, or those whose arms were not by their sides, or those who held their chin to low, were all reminded very quickly with the sudden smack of the wooden pole.  The Knight-Brothers did not bother to knock Rohak or Kamoa around, because they should know their place, and they were to stand over to the side and watch their new recruits get broken in.Just as soon as they were in line the Knight-Brothers grabbed bowls of old, stale bread and threw it amongst the group; they'd have to quickly reach up and grab what they could and shove it in their mouth if they wanted any type of breakfast.  \"Stay in line, soldier,\" they yelled if one moved their feet.  There wasn't much bread, and most of the recruits probably wouldn't get anything at all!As the last piece of bread was thrown another Knight-Brother walked by with a large barrel of water, the cap on top unloosened and he started to pour it out; the recruits in the first line would need to cup their hands and catch what little bit of water they could.  \"Share!\" yelled the Knight, as he refused to give the other lines any water.Finally, everything got quiet, and the five Knight-Brothers stood together in front of the group ahead of some small buckets, with Rohak and Kamoa off to the side watching.  \"I don't see your shields,\" one of the Brothers mocked the recruits.  \"Loose!\"  At that point the Knights bent down, picked up the buckets, and chunked them forward, letting loose a hail of rocks on the recruits.  \"Let me see those shields!\"The recruits hurriedly ran over to a spot where some shields were piled.  Still being pelted by a barrage of rocks, the recruits picked up the shields until they realized their wasn't enough.  \"Protect your Brothers,\" the Knights barked, \"shields up, watch the backs of your Brothers!\"  The recruits did what they could to block the barrage of rocks and tried forming a hodgepodge shield wall.\"Who's hungry?\" barked one of the Knight-Brothers as they stopped throwing rocks.  The recruits mostly raised their hands, but some kept them down cause they thought this was another test.  \"Good news and bad news,\" the Knight-Brother said, grinning.  \"The bread some of you ate was poisoned.  The water some of you drunk was poisoned.  The rocks you got hit with was coated with firesalt.  At any moment you will begin to puke.  At any moment, your skin will begin to burn.  Now, you will all fight until you can't fight anymore; last one standing gets a full meal.  Go!\"Several recruits would suddenly barf up the tainted bread and water; they'd be just fine, just a little sick for an hour or so.  The entire group would also start to yell and holler as their skin burned painfully, but these effects would wear off soon enough.  If they started feeling any better, the fight for the meal could begin.The Knight-Brothers walked over to Rohak and Kamoa.  \"After breakfast, we'll start horseback riding,\" one of them said enthusiastically.  \"If you're hungry, you can find good bread and wine in the larder.

She was also decidedly not a warrior, carrying the air of a mage about her.

It is not my own, but one in which I played a small part. It is the story of a brave Elf, the last of her people, destined to be queen, and how she reclaimed her home from the grip of darkness. Let me tell you the story of Queen Emahra the Valiant, and the Cleansing of Kehl-Nari...\"In ages long past, in another plane, on a world much like this one, there was a land known as Itaia. It was created by loving Gods, who gazed upon their creation in satisfaction. But they saw that it was empty, devoid of all life but that of the beasts and the plants, and so they took parts of their own minds, and created the races. First to be made were the gentle Ethinians, the children whose hearts and souls were so close to the earth; they tended the planet with the love and tenderness of their creators. Seeing that what they had made was good, the Gods crafted of the earth the Argentai Elves, proud and strong in the ways of magic; but they were a haughty, arrogant people, convinced of their own superiority, and they were cruel to the Ethinians, treating them as no better than slaves and chattel. Seeing this, the Gods were displeased, and while some wanted to strike the Argentai down for their hubris, others suggested that a force be made to temper them. And so it was that the final of the three races of Itaia was made. From the sky were the Kehl-Nari Elves wrought, just and true with blades and armor of gleaming metal. They liberated the Ethinians from the Argentai and guarded them closely, harboring the peaceful peoples in a place of safety. For many long years, they lived in an uneasy truce, engaging in small wars and various skirmishes.\"But this story is not about that time.\"This tale takes place thousands of years down the line, when the seventeenth Queen of Kehl-Nari, Talande the Wise, of the line of Untyrid, reigned over the land. Unlike most of her people, she was a mage of some power, and she had been given the gift of Prophecy, which she used to rule her people with a firm but gentle hand. She had a young daughter named Emahra, a child with hair as blue as the endless waters of the Virinea Sea, and she was a wild, rambunctious child who loved and was loved by all around her. Emahra was but a babe when her mother and father, the Queen and King, made a secret pact with the Emperor and Empress Consort of the Argentai Elves, who had a young son. When the two came of age, they would be wed, in the hopes that the royal union would join the two peoples in an ever-lasting peace. But the Emperor was unwise, and shared this knowledge with his brother, who was jealous, and coveted the Crown of Stone for himself, and he began to plot against his brother, conspiring with forces of darkness out of reach beyond the Veil.\"Emahra was but a child of ten when her mother received a vision most horrific. She saw the Empire across the sea overtaken by a tide of darkness, which spread across the waters and into the lands of the Kehl-Nari, destroying all in its wake and leaving naught but ash behind. Shaken to the core by this terrible omen, Talande gathered the Heirloom blade of her House, the Blade of Ankiri, and bundled it safely into a magically protected cloth. Knowing that time was of the essence, she roused her daughter from sleep and dressed her hurriedly, before carting her off to the royal stables in the dead of night. There she bade Emahra mount the swiftest horse, and bound the Blade to its saddle, before taking her daughter\u2019s hands and gazing tearfully up at her bewildered and fearful Heir Apparent.\"`My sweet girl, I know you are frightened - but you must be brave. There is a great task in your future, but you cannot learn what you need to accomplish it in this place. You must ride now, Emahra. Ride, and do not look back.`\"And although it pained her deeply to leave behind her mother, her father, her people, everything she knew and loved, she wouldn\u2019t disobey her mother. Taking the reins in hand, she spurred the swift horse from the stables and fled into the dwindling realm of night. She rode long and hard, passing into the forest at the very edges of the kingdom, all the while unaware of what was happening to those left behind. She had no way of knowing that, mere hours after she had passed safely beyond the last mountains at the edge of the realm, the hordes of darkness raged across the sea and, having already consumed the Argentai people as a whole, laid waste to the Kehl-Nari, leaving naught but bones and ash in their wake.\"For many years, Emahra roamed. She was cared for by the Elves of a distant land, for a time, and they taught her the use of the broadsword of House Untyrid. She became a powerful and charismatic leader, strong and proud, with a steadfast heart and a pure soul. I was but a wandering sorceress, then, and when I met her, Emahra had just decided upon the quest to retake her homeland and claim her crown, believing that war had sprung up with the Argentai in her absence. She was a striking figure, with her long blue hair, and the sword upon her hip which hummed with power. She promised me a welcome in her realm, a place where I could live and practice my magics in peace, and, enticed by this, I agreed to join her.\"Over the next three years, we made the trip back to Itaia, gathering a motley crew to help her in her task. There was Denor, the ranger, who joined us only after Emahra bested him in battle. There was Taela Xhos, the kind-hearted healer who came when she learned that there may be people in need of her help. And there was Ssavrin the Red, the dragonrider, who sought a place to live free of persecution and strictures, to train a new order of dragon knights. With this band, we traveled across the open lands, past the mountains, and back to Kehl-Nari. It was then that Emahra learned the truth of her peoples\u2019 fate; the Kehl-Nari elves were no more, crushed beneath the same shadow which had brought an end to the Argentai.\"While many would have fallen to darkness in their thirst for revenge, Emahra\u2019s heart was too pure to stray down this path. She vowed to purge the land of the evil creatures which befouled it, and although she was the last of her people, she intended to lead the land back to an age of prosperity. We had met little resistance when we first entered the realm, but the further we pressed into the empty lands, the battles grew fierce. Emahra was like a whirlwind of blue fire as she danced among the twisted monsters of that darkness, her blade shining with all the intensity of a fallen star, cleaving heads from bodies and separating limbs. Every conflict left her standing in pools of inky ichor, her chest heaving with exertion and her arms shaking from the strain.\"And yet she kept on fighting. There was a weariness about her that never went away, no matter how much rest she got. Sometimes I saw her in the deepest part of the night, sitting with the Blade drawn and her noble brow pressed to the flame crest of her House which adorned its crossguard, silently praying for guidance. Months passed in this manner, with us cleaving into the ranks of those horrid monsters day after day, but there never seemed to be an end to them. The others began to lose hope - even I sometimes doubted whether or not we would actually be victorious. But Emahra never did. Her spirit was unfailing in its determination, her hope like a beacon that lit the way through the unending waves of darkness which we faced for what felt like an eternity.\"After six months, we managed to fight our way through to what remained of the capital city. It had once been an exquisitely crafted city of white stone, from its shining streets, to the elegant lines and delicate arches that crowned its buildings. It was but a shadow of its former self, the houses vacant, the paths littered with bones that were slowly crumbling beneath the passage of time. It was like walking through a world forgotten by life itself. Emahra led us to the castle, but we were forced to remain outside its doors; there was a powerful enchantment cast across the whole structure that barred us from entering, allowing no one but the rightful ruler to enter its hallowed halls.\"She was gone for two days, leaving us to fight on our own. Even years later, after the battle had been won and Kehl-Nari was a land of peace and plenty, she refused to tell anyone - not myself, not Denor who became her husband, not her daughter - what happened within that place. All she ever told us was that she ascended to the highest room of the tallest tower, and that there, she found the means for Kehl-Nari\u2019s salvation. It was an ancient artifact, created by Queen Saalira the Guiding Star, the First Queen of Kehl-Nari, called the Flame of Saalira, and it housed a portion of the spirit of every Queen of Kehl-Nari. When Emahra passed the trial that protected this Flame, she was possessed of all the knowledge and power of these past Queens.\"The woman who had become my friend was there in body only when she returned from that tower. There was an ancient wisdom about her, and a power so deep and terrible that it filled us all with an awestruck fear. When she spoke, it was with the voices of those who had come before, a melange of different tones that was constantly changing. She bade us come with her for one last stand, one last attempt to purge the lands of this evil and free what remained of Kehl-Nari from darkness. We could do nothing but follow. We were pledged to her, to this woman who would be our Queen.\"We followed her to the vast plain outside of the city, and there we waited. It didn\u2019t take long for the entire horde to find us, and within hours, we were completely surrounded. There was nothing but a writhing blackness around us, as far as the eye could see and beyond. It even painted the sky in shadows, shrouding the earth in a perpetual gloom that seemed to oppress the very soul. Except for Emahra. She shone with the light of the heavens itself, that great and awful power seeming to burst from within her. The creatures snapped and snarled at us, offended by her luminance, and then it happened. They struck, all as one body.\"It was all we could do just to keep ourselves alive. Fighting with our backs against each other, we battled for what felt like years. It couldn\u2019t have been more than a few hours, though. Ssavrin and his dragon were the first to fall, and Lady Taela soon after, leaving only Emahra, Denor, and myself. But there was no time to mourn their loss. Our doom seemed certain when through the throng there came an earth-shaking voice, calling out its challenge to the Elven warrior.\"`You who bear the light of ages, come forth and face me! I am Rrothlar the Nightbringer, and I will consume you!`\"The ground quaked beneath us with the force of this beast\u2019s steps as it strode forward from the darkness. Never before had I seen such a terrible creature. It loomed over us, as tall as the castle\u2019s highest tower, and had the shape of a man, but it was twisted. An arm protruded from its back, and tendrils of night spun from its shadowed body, snapping and twisting in a way that seemed to designed to drive the mind toward madness. In each of its clawed hands, it grasped a sword, the blade of which seemed to try and suck in the light that poured from Emahra. Denor and I were terrified, able to do little more than try and hold off the army. But Emahra was unafraid. She leaped forward to confront this unholy creature, her sword singing with the voices of countless souls as she called in her many tones.\"`I am Emahra Untyrid, last of my House, last of my people, and you will fall this day, creature of darkness! No longer will you cast your blight across my lands! This I decree as Queen of Kehl-Nari!`\"The power which had seemed contained within her before now burst from Emahra with all the force of an exploding star. With every swing of her sword, the hordes fell, waves of energy streaming from the blade and ripping into them. Its power was so great that it left nothing behind, not limbs, not bone, not ash; it simply wiped them from existence with great blazing sweeps of light. Countless numbers were felled before her, and Rrothlar seemed to grow more and more enraged with every dark creature that met its end. Finally, he rushed upon her, and the battle truly began.\"For all his being countless times bigger than her, the light that shone from within Emahra was unfailing, keeping the hulking beast at bay. Its tentacles burned and sizzled every time they tried to attack, and her sword always rose to catch his, deflecting blades the size of trees with all the effort of batting away a fly. The army stopped to watch as its leader fought ours, great arcing bolts of lightning crackling through the air every time glowing steel met light-sucking swords. The planet itself seemed to shudder beneath this clash of godly power, and groaned as it was rent apart, leaving gaping chasms scattered across the plains and shearing through the great mountains.\"They fought all through the night, leaving craters in the ground, as we struggled to hold off the remnants of the army which never seemed to end. At last, the impenetrable pall of twilight which had fallen across the land was pierced by a single flicker of light from the east. The sun was rising, shafts of brilliance piercing through the cloak of death and landing upon Emahra. As Rrothlar raised his trio of swords with a mighty roar and sought to cleave Emahra into pieces, she launched herself at him with a cry that shook the very skies. Her Blade lit with the power of innumerable suns bound into solid form, its glow blinding us even as we hid our faces.\"There was a sound like the sundering of the world itself, and a wind so strong that it flattened us to the ground. And then, there was silence. When at last we raised our faces from the grass, it was to the sight of an unblemished spring morning. The army of darkness was gone, destroyed in a vortex of power so great, it had cleansed the land. Rrothlar was no more, even his great swords were cast into some uncharted abyss between time and space. All that remained was Emahra, standing victorious in the glow of the newly-risen sun. Her sword blazed with the light of purity, and her eyes were filled with the look of a woman who has fulfilled her destiny.\"That was the day that Queen Emahra the Valiant, Last Daughter of the House of Untyrid, Scion of the Kehl-Nari people, reclaimed her land from the clutches of evil. Her story doesn\u2019t end there, but then, does one war truly encompass an entire life? I think not. Take from this story what you will. My telling is at an end.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<font face=\"times\">The woman who approached this stone edifice of strength with its complement of warriors looked far too serene. She was also decidedly not a warrior, carrying the air of a mage about her. She made her way toward where the recruits were gathered, eagerly awaiting a tale of valor, Reuna sat herself down in front of them and smiled. <font color=\"purple\">\"My name is Reuna Laur\u00e9nt, and I've come to share a tale with you. It is not my own, but one in which I played a small part. It is the story of a brave Elf, the last of her people, destined to be queen, and how she reclaimed her home from the grip of darkness. Let me tell you the story of Queen Emahra the Valiant, and the Cleansing of Kehl-Nari...<br><br/>\"In ages long past, in another plane, on a world much like this one, there was a land known as Itaia. It was created by loving Gods, who gazed upon their creation in satisfaction. But they saw that it was empty, devoid of all life but that of the beasts and the plants, and so they took parts of their own minds, and created the races. First to be made were the gentle Ethinians, the children whose hearts and souls were so close to the earth; they tended the planet with the love and tenderness of their creators. Seeing that what they had made was good, the Gods crafted of the earth the Argentai Elves, proud and strong in the ways of magic; but they were a haughty, arrogant people, convinced of their own superiority, and they were cruel to the Ethinians, treating them as no better than slaves and chattel. Seeing this, the Gods were displeased, and while some wanted to strike the Argentai down for their hubris, others suggested that a force be made to temper them. And so it was that the final of the three races of Itaia was made. From the sky were the Kehl-Nari Elves wrought, just and true with blades and armor of gleaming metal. They liberated the Ethinians from the Argentai and guarded them closely, harboring the peaceful peoples in a place of safety. For many long years, they lived in an uneasy truce, engaging in small wars and various skirmishes.<br/><br/>\"But this story is not about that time.<br/><br/>\"This tale takes place thousands of years down the line, when the seventeenth Queen of Kehl-Nari, Talande the Wise, of the line of Untyrid, reigned over the land. Unlike most of her people, she was a mage of some power, and she had been given the gift of Prophecy, which she used to rule her people with a firm but gentle hand. She had a young daughter named Emahra, a child with hair as blue as the endless waters of the Virinea Sea, and she was a wild, rambunctious child who loved and was loved by all around her. Emahra was but a babe when her mother and father, the Queen and King, made a secret pact with the Emperor and Empress Consort of the Argentai Elves, who had a young son. When the two came of age, they would be wed, in the hopes that the royal union would join the two peoples in an ever-lasting peace. But the Emperor was unwise, and shared this knowledge with his brother, who was jealous, and coveted the Crown of Stone for himself, and he began to plot against his brother, conspiring with forces of darkness out of reach beyond the Veil.<br/><br/>\"Emahra was but a child of ten when her mother received a vision most horrific. She saw the Empire across the sea overtaken by a tide of darkness, which spread across the waters and into the lands of the Kehl-Nari, destroying all in its wake and leaving naught but ash behind. Shaken to the core by this terrible omen, Talande gathered the Heirloom blade of her House, the Blade of Ankiri, and bundled it safely into a magically protected cloth. Knowing that time was of the essence, she roused her daughter from sleep and dressed her hurriedly, before carting her off to the royal stables in the dead of night. There she bade Emahra mount the swiftest horse, and bound the Blade to its saddle, before taking her daughter\u2019s hands and gazing tearfully up at her bewildered and fearful Heir Apparent.<br/><br/>\"`My sweet girl, I know you are frightened - but you must be brave. There is a great task in your future, but you cannot learn what you need to accomplish it in this place. You must ride now, Emahra. Ride, and do not look back.`<br/><br/>\"And although it pained her deeply to leave behind her mother, her father, her people, everything she knew and loved, she wouldn\u2019t disobey her mother. Taking the reins in hand, she spurred the swift horse from the stables and fled into the dwindling realm of night. She rode long and hard, passing into the forest at the very edges of the kingdom, all the while unaware of what was happening to those left behind. She had no way of knowing that, mere hours after she had passed safely beyond the last mountains at the edge of the realm, the hordes of darkness raged across the sea and, having already consumed the Argentai people as a whole, laid waste to the Kehl-Nari, leaving naught but bones and ash in their wake.<br/><br/>\"For many years, Emahra roamed. She was cared for by the Elves of a distant land, for a time, and they taught her the use of the broadsword of House Untyrid. She became a powerful and charismatic leader, strong and proud, with a steadfast heart and a pure soul. I was but a wandering sorceress, then, and when I met her, Emahra had just decided upon the quest to retake her homeland and claim her crown, believing that war had sprung up with the Argentai in her absence. She was a striking figure, with her long blue hair, and the sword upon her hip which hummed with power. She promised me a welcome in her realm, a place where I could live and practice my magics in peace, and, enticed by this, I agreed to join her.<br/><br/>\"Over the next three years, we made the trip back to Itaia, gathering a motley crew to help her in her task. There was Denor, the ranger, who joined us only after Emahra bested him in battle. There was Taela Xhos, the kind-hearted healer who came when she learned that there may be people in need of her help. And there was Ssavrin the Red, the dragonrider, who sought a place to live free of persecution and strictures, to train a new order of dragon knights. With this band, we traveled across the open lands, past the mountains, and back to Kehl-Nari. It was then that Emahra learned the truth of her peoples\u2019 fate; the Kehl-Nari elves were no more, crushed beneath the same shadow which had brought an end to the Argentai.<br/><br/>\"While many would have fallen to darkness in their thirst for revenge, Emahra\u2019s heart was too pure to stray down this path. She vowed to purge the land of the evil creatures which befouled it, and although she was the last of her people, she intended to lead the land back to an age of prosperity. We had met little resistance when we first entered the realm, but the further we pressed into the empty lands, the battles grew fierce. Emahra was like a whirlwind of blue fire as she danced among the twisted monsters of that darkness, her blade shining with all the intensity of a fallen star, cleaving heads from bodies and separating limbs. Every conflict left her standing in pools of inky ichor, her chest heaving with exertion and her arms shaking from the strain.<br/><br/>\"And yet she kept on fighting. There was a weariness about her that never went away, no matter how much rest she got. Sometimes I saw her in the deepest part of the night, sitting with the Blade drawn and her noble brow pressed to the flame crest of her House which adorned its crossguard, silently praying for guidance. Months passed in this manner, with us cleaving into the ranks of those horrid monsters day after day, but there never seemed to be an end to them. The others began to lose hope - even I sometimes doubted whether or not we would actually be victorious. But Emahra never did. Her spirit was unfailing in its determination, her hope like a beacon that lit the way through the unending waves of darkness which we faced for what felt like an eternity.<br/><br/>\"After six months, we managed to fight our way through to what remained of the capital city. It had once been an exquisitely crafted city of white stone, from its shining streets, to the elegant lines and delicate arches that crowned its buildings. It was but a shadow of its former self, the houses vacant, the paths littered with bones that were slowly crumbling beneath the passage of time. It was like walking through a world forgotten by life itself. Emahra led us to the castle, but we were forced to remain outside its doors; there was a powerful enchantment cast across the whole structure that barred us from entering, allowing no one but the rightful ruler to enter its hallowed halls.<br/><br/>\"She was gone for two days, leaving us to fight on our own. Even years later, after the battle had been won and Kehl-Nari was a land of peace and plenty, she refused to tell anyone - not myself, not Denor who became her husband, not her daughter - what happened within that place. All she ever told us was that she ascended to the highest room of the tallest tower, and that there, she found the means for Kehl-Nari\u2019s salvation. It was an ancient artifact, created by Queen Saalira the Guiding Star, the First Queen of Kehl-Nari, called the Flame of Saalira, and it housed a portion of the spirit of every Queen of Kehl-Nari. When Emahra passed the trial that protected this Flame, she was possessed of all the knowledge and power of these past Queens.<br/><br/>\"The woman who had become my friend was there in body only when she returned from that tower.
