First of all there is the wide open spaces and wide variety of terrains. Second, there are the small wyverns and drakes.These small dragons, like Small Green-Wing Drake, are not the stuff of legend. Really they are just big flying lizards, no bigger than large horses. However, they are surprisingly intelligent and amicable towards humans, causing the Land-Tillers to form a symbiotic relationship with them.In exchange for providing food and lodgings, the small dragons help protect the expanse and its people.In order to enter this area, one must gain consent of one of the wyverns.", "link_list": ["/user/1264"], "image_list": ["http://pre11.deviantart.net/ff77/th/pre/i/2013/340/c/3/green_wyvern_by_childofdune-d6x0k2m.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://pre11.deviantart.net/ff77/th/pre/i/2013/340/c/3/green_wyvern_by_childofdune-d6x0k2m.jpg\" style=\"max-width:50%;\"/></div>"}, "post-34661": {"user": "The Kingdom of Belrow", "user_num": 1359, "timestamp": "1461477726000", "message": "The party of the dead walked towards the Wyvern guards.
