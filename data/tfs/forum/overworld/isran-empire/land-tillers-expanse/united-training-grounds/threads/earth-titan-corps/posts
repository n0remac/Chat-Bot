It does not tell of a day when the hourglass of time was still very much full, it speaks of a far more recent time, of I and my plight with a dragon. If you were to be excused, this shall be done in a poetic form.\"\"One day, o'er the gem-filled crags of a hundred foot cave,Sat a single stick in a clearing, not a campfire,Two compatriots stood, a knight and a knave,The knight was unaware of his alliance with this lier,The fool knight had been expecting the embrace of silver,The cruel night had not began, the moon not even a sliver,The pocket-picker and the warrior were soon to be even,When a dragon of black coals, had seen them.The silly back-stabber, moving abruptly forward,A plight of great fright causes him to stop, his vision blurred,A great scaly beast beat his wings and roared,And for the poor knight behind, it had struck a chord.He knew of the imbeciles own mistake,He could fix this - the distance was not too great.His moral compass accompanied him so,He would save his accomplice, he could not just say 'no'.The sneak was afoot by a lizard of unimaginable size,But he had found shelter, under stone, under earth, which the dragon did not realise,And so the Armored savior had caught up with the despairing twit,The draconic thing was certainly terrible, it's eyes were slits.The battle-hardened fighter began the mighty duel,Little did he know, the dragon's method of fighting, was rather cruel.Spears of fire landed from the skies,Where his melee could not function, he would certainly die.But then and there did the coward set the score,Giving a command to remove the dragon's tail, to cause it to fall,A throw of unimaginable speed and power,Pierced the dragon's body, causing a bloody shower.A dragonic limb of great size hit the ground,Where the conniving bugger had wanted it to be found,His plan was genius, a plot to summon a demon,A sizeable sacrifice, if he were able to free one.And so a muscled, flaming monstrosity erupted from some flames,As the knave summoned a Balrog, a creature that shouldn't be named.The dragon was not stupid, it knew it had been beat,So it bowed it's head at the winners, and made swift retreat.This is the tale of how two enemies chose to fight under one banner,It did not matter that they did not like eachother, in any way or manner,So heed this advice, if you see an adversary in danger,Maybe next time, helping you, to them, won't be much stranger.\"He had finished his poem.

Was it a true story? How long did it take Attla to memorize the poem? If a Balrog shouldn't be named then why is it called a Balrog?Overall the stories was well received. It was intriguing, especially since knights and rogues were still a relatively new phenomenon. Demon summoning was actually considered a legitimate form of magic for more rebellious folk, and though it wasn't exactly smiled upon, it was considered better than necromancy (which had an unfortunate history here). The man himself continued to be eyed with suspicion. Someone was kind enough to get him a new cloak though.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The Land-Tillers had never heard such odd poetry coming from such an odd man."}}
