These mages specialize in healing, using telepathy to relay orders, and casting defensive shields. They do not have a set camp, but rather travel among all the other camps to learn about their tactics and strategies. In a sense they are the heart and soul of Land-Tiller military doctrine. Work together, share a common goal, protect the innocent, and maintain peace.This is the ONLY military division where one will find members of the reclusive Sodalite Clan.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://dnd.wizards.com/sites/default/files/media/styles/news_banner/public/images/news/20150911_SeptemberSurvey_thumb.jpg?itok=52XfYyku"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://dnd.wizards.com/sites/default/files/media/styles/news_banner/public/images/news/20150911_SeptemberSurvey_thumb.jpg?itok=52XfYyku\" style=\"max-width:60%;\"/></div>"}}
