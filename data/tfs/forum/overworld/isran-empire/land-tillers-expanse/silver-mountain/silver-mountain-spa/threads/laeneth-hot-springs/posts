It becomes noticeably warmer as soon as one steps into the cave entrance, and plenty of light enters through openings in the roof. The cave floor is surprisingly clean, devoid of dust or bat droppings. The navy blue waters themselves are said to possess minor healing properties and radiate a soft mist.When one steps into the hot water, occasionally they will be greeted by floating enchanted flowers, each giving off a faint energy which resonates within the person's soul. The colors one attracts seems to have to do with the person's personality and state of mind, though the actual logic behind it is rather complex and esoteric.Finally, those in who are most stressed and in need of healing will trigger stones in the water to give off a special vibration, almost like a cat's purrs.
