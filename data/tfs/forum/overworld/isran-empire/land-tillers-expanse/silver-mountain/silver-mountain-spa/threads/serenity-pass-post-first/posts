Not the worst method of travel she's ever used, Naoki thinks, all appendages seem to be in order.Jun\u2019s comment momentarily ignored, Naoki spends a moment to look around. They seem to be standing in a courtyard of sorts. Stone arches lead off in various directions, and the sound of rushing water fills the air. The air feels... different, too, though she can't quite place how. Curious, Naoki takes a few steps over toward one of the arches and looks through. \u201cOoh,\u201d she says, mildly surprised. Just beyond, there seems to be a cliff, of who-knows-what height. It\u2019s difficult to say; mist obscures the ground, but they\u2019re apparently a good portion of the way up a mountain.

There's still a bit of walk since exercise is supposed to be part of the cleansing process, but I promise it won't be too difficult, more of a leisurely stroll.\"Most of the stone arches punctuate a path leading to an ancient-looking stone arch bridge, which itself leads deeper into the mountain. The first arch is flanked by two statuesque, young elves (relatively speaking; elves are known to live for centuries). They were wearing thick tunics with multiple layers. One was apparently male, and the other female; they had similar length hair, however. They both waved serenely at the three ladies.\"I know you're infinitely wealthier than me but please, allow me.\" Jun reached into her pocket and pulled out some semi-precious stones and a few Isranian coins. \"Don't misunderstand. This isn't a toll, but rather a donation. They also take food and clothing. They're basically monks.\" She took a few steps forward, bowed respectfully to the elves, and deposited the baubles into a large clay pot.\"Alright, whenever you- OH SHI-\" Before she could complete her phrase she covered her mouth; she didn't want to use profanity in front of the elves.

The roar of a distant waterfall harmonized with the breeze. Gnarled trees with verdant leaves and branches clung fast to the softer spots of the earth in the mountainside. The further along they traveled, the more the path seemed to split and take different routes. Strangely, Jun seemed to know exactly where they were going.\"So here's the thing.\" Jun smirked guiltily. \"You're supposed to let this place surprise you a bit, let nature guide you and what-not. We could just as easily come across a meditation stop as a hot spring to bathe in, or a masseuse's hut. It's part of the experience.
