The pass was carefully designed to appear rustic, ancient and mysterious, when in fact it is climate controlled and easy to maintain. The massive vultures who fly overhead aren't even native to the Expanse, but rather imported (much to the chagrin of the nature-conscious elves on the other side of the mountain). Even the name was chosen to counterbalance\u00a0Serenity Pass.Visitors are encouraged to ignore the native Land-Tiller elves who occasionally protest the arena's existence. They are told that they are merely disgruntled about the wait time for the next amazing fight, and then led through the pass with a smile.There are also mounts and teleportations pads for the elderly and disabled, for a minor fee of course.Once guests enter the arena, they are free to choose either the contestant corridor or the spectator corridor. Matches are scheduled periodically, but on most days anyone is welcome to come to the arena to spar (for a minor fee), with other guests free to watch. The arena itself is sizable and designed to accommodate\u00a0even small dragons.The most important feature is the patent-pending Magical Terrain Change System\u2122. The Magical Terrain Change System\u2122, which has been trademarked, by Isra, lest anyone forget, allows combatants to alter the arena to suit particular needs via a Terrain Change Terminal\u2122, located at the entrance to the main combat zone. So far there is a Fire Change Arena\u2122, a Water Change Arena\u2122, a Rocky Change Arena\u2122, a Marble Change Arena\u2122, a Grass Change Arena\u2122, and a Forest Change Arena\u2122. All arenas are available in normal mode,\u00a0Anti-Magic Mode\u2122 (the anti-magic field is projected just above the arena floor and doesn't interfere with arena enchantments and safety mechanisms) and Magic-Enhanced Mode\u2122. Yes, there is a mode that increases the power of magical attacks, to help give the mage fights a little zest.\u00a0Naturally the emergency medical clerics on duty at the arena are the finest in the world, and various enchantments are there to prevent death.The primary investor in the arena,\u00a0Fi Jonorin   , is overtly concerned with protecting the property rights of the patent-pending\u00a0Magical Terrain Change System\u2122. Guards are posted in various locations, ostensibly to prevent thievery and help maintain order, but also to protect the secrets of the patent-pending\u00a0Magical Terrain Change System\u2122.One more important note. Fights to the death are absolutely forbidden. Defensive wards will activate if a contestant's vitals reach critical levels or if a killing blow is about to be delivered, even in an anti-magic zone.Instructions on how to use the arena can be found here.", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/2088/use-rainbow-arena", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1747/serenity-pass-post-first", "/user/1616", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/2088/use-rainbow-arena"], "image_list": ["http://www.wallpaperup.com/uploads/wallpapers/2015/04/21/667561/big_thumb_b2d094d1f5dd065f620061351e769460.jpg", "http://67.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8v9cnzsIv1qgvvtno1_1280.jpg"], "html": "Instructions on how to use the arena can be "}}
