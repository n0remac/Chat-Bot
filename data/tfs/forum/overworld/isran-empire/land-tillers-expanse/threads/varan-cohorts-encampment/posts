If Andraste Ruana  continued her advance into the Expanse she would come upon this camp.The camp was built in the middle of an open grassland.  Forests run along the north and south, although if an army approach from either direction the camp\u2019s occupants would see them clearly before they made their approach.  A palisade wall surrounds part of the camp, with the unfinished sections blocked off by wagons (like a wagon fort).It appears only a few sentries stand guard, yet they do not move and look almost unnatural.  A few fires burn within, but give off little smoke.  The overall noise is negligible, as if the camp has been abandoned.The Varan Cohorts", "link_list": ["/user/264", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/2950/varan-cohorts"], "image_list": [], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><b><u>Varan Cohorts Encampment</u></b></div>"}, "post-81405": {"user": "The Wyld Hordes", "user_num": 2949, "timestamp": "1523228246000", "message": "All is quiet for a long time, although in the distance a great murder of crows can be seen circling the Southern Plains.

Those few unnatural, unmoving sentries may have looked like Varan from a distance, but they were but straw men adorned with mock armor.  The camp is deserted - made obvious by the few fires still burning and overall quietness of the fortification.For the moment, the main body of the Varan Cohorts were nowhere to be seen.  The trap had been set, and the spring sprung, but mice were nowhere to be seen, and so the Varan had no one to engage.
