I'm the one who's being held captive.\" Jun grinned devilishly.She watched as the dragon struggled to turn itself into a human, for about five minutes. Once she had her fill of venison, she decided to continue with her experiments.After 25 minutes or so, an isolated section of the cave floor was littered with little mounds of earth, each housing a little lichen on top. Some of them also had some cave mushrooms sprouting up next to the lichens. Each one had a scroll slapped onto the side of the mound, similar to the teleportation beacon she had used earlier, but with different shaped sigils scribbled onto them. Floating over each mound was some combination of a glowing, sun-like sphere the size of a softball, a fuzzy miniature rain cloud, one alternating for the other, or nothing at all. The intent was clearly to determine the ideal conditions in which these lichens could grow.Jun looked over her work with pride. Her elemental magic was becoming increasingly sophisticated with each passing year. When she first started her adventure, she could never have done something like this. She was too focused on blowing stuff up. Now it was starting to look like she would one day surpass her father's farming abilities.And she could still blow things up.What she was not particularly good at was the weirder, wackier side of magic. Working with the world's natural elements was relatively simple. It was all about making friends with the elements, resonating with them. Making them bend over backwards to transform a dragon into a person, or even an object into another object, was something else entirely. At this point, it was literally easier for Jun to summon a thundercloud than convincingly pull a rabbit out of a hat.So when the cloud of smoke came and Clama managed to actually do something, she swiveled around and watched with interest. Had she really done it? Had she transformed into a human, through pure concentration alone?!If she had, Clama's instinct for magic was actually quite good, even if it did take half an hour.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"Well, how could that be?
