The very ground was soaked in the blood of the innocent. This civil war was a bloody one. He had brought with him his guard party as protection, and as he got closer to the most prominent ruins, he felt like he would need them.Yerazin did not want to be here again. Although the landscape has changed and the ruins obscure his view he knew this place. He had killed innocent people here long ago. He was forced to watch as the very magic he had used to help his people was used to burn the flesh from the bones of women and children. He had flash backs of the death that had been created those days long ago. Remembered as the silent legions methodically put every living thing here to the sword. His people unflinching to the pleas of families.\u00a0That was the burden all that had been given speech had to bear. In return for their soul being placed completely into the new bodies, they remembered all that they had done. It was times like this that he envied his servants. Acting as nothing more then semi-sentient automatons they did not think or feel or remember. They only had their orders, nothing more. The overlord had ordained that only those that he knew would not lose their minds were permitted to fully possess vessels. Even then, some had been lost to the madness and had to be locked away.\u00a0Yerazin had reached the outskirts of the main castle. He could feel it. Pulling on his soul every so lightly, a constant light pressure on his mind. A shard was here, that was for sure. If it was awake, Yerazin did not know. Very tentatively he reached out with his magic. Trying to search for any sentient pressance. Brushing over the minds of some of the beasts that slept in the dark he though he had found it. And it found him. As his mind touched with that of the beast, he was instantly sent reling, the vast unimaginable power and knowledge inside of its mind was impossible to comprehend. \"So, the slaves have returned from their slumber.\" Yerazin heard inside of his mind. \"I thought I was going to need to build myself a new army. The last one did not do so well.\" Yerazin felt the creatures will be pressed on him. He felt as his mind was slowly being engulfed by the will of the beast, covered in a think black sludge. \"No.\" Relakor said out loud. \"I will not submit... to you again, you are a... false god. We will bend you... to our will now.\"\u00a0The creature was confused as slowly his powers were pushed from Yerazin's mind. As soon as he was free Yerazin knew he did not have much time. Ordering his men to follow him, he turned and galloped the undead horses as far away as he could. The creature was awake and it hungered once more.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Yerazin had been travelling through the ruins for over a day now on the back of one of the skeletal horses.
