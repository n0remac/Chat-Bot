Your people are of course welcome here as guests, and I see no reason why they should not be even more welcome should they contribute the knowledge of swordplay to our warriors.

I don't believe this will pose too much of a challenge, given what you have told me of yourself. First, you must respect all life. You must only kill when necessary and do your best to show mercy. Second, you must respect other people's views on the gods and the spiritual world. In the end, we all strive to better ourselves. Some of us believe in gods, and some of us believe in something not so easily explained. Your people are of course welcome to practice the faith of Angelism, and should you wish to invite others to join you in your faith, that is fine too. But we must all strive to live in peace. And finally, you must learn to live in harmony with the land. We have spent thousands of years learning how to receive the earth's bounty without harming it. Our forests are vasts, our farms produce bounties, and the creatures with whom we share this land thrive as we do. Our technology is quite primitive compared to say, Gauldin, or even Isra. It is only because of our magics and our connection to the earth that we are able to create large stone structures. Therefore we must continue to respect this principle to commune with the magic of the earth itself.\"The dragon who visited us is part of our lesser known history. It has been lost throughout the ages, but there are still a few among us who know the truth. That creature, is the original creator of the Expanse. She is one of the great guardians of the earth and an unfathomably ancient being. Her return signifies a new age in our history, one we hope will entail prosperity for our people. Va'nei Dha'zhi, Earthwarden , she is called. And she represents the spirit of the Land-Tillers.
