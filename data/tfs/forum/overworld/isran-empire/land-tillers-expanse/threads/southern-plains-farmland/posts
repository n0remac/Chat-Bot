He gasps as he feels the power of nature around him that he is drawing from, the feeling of drawing upon this energy quite different and intriguing. \"This is good,\" Daedalus says, mostly to himself before moments later a bright aura of green nature energy erupts from him, his channeling increasing tenfold as he begins drawing large amounts of natural energy. In fact, he is drawing so much energy that plants around him begin to wither. \"I will contain the far side of the Wyld's growth, you focus on this side.\"In a brilliant flash of light Daedalus teleported to the other side of the Wyld, facing wall of vines that encroached across the fields. Daedalus had gathered a massive amount of power by now and would begin bringing it to bear against the Wyld. All around him in the field any plants that were still alive began to wither and die. As it turned out, the particular brand of nature magic he studied in particular had to do with disease and death, and he began concocting a nasty pestilence that would begin to spread through the field and towards the Wyld that would kill any plants it touched. It's progress could be noted as a wave of plants decaying and crumbling in seconds.

She actually planned on writing a complicated glyph and having him tap into the seeds' power as they emerged into nature energy vines. But then he went ahead and just ate them. And most bizarely of all, that worked perfectly.What a guy.\"I still have a lot to learn...\"As she watched the Wyld and Land-Tillers do battle across the field, she started breathing deeply. Her strategy was going to be a little bit different from his.She planted her feet together and folded her hands together. What was to follow would be in some ways her ultimate ability, something she had spent a year mastering deep within Va'nei's domain. In some ways it was a spell, but in a more profound way it was a rather simple skill. All she was going to do was ask for help. As her heart reached out to the world around her, something in the air changed. It was a faint aura, an unimposing one, like a light, wispy crystal. It had no color, and wouldn't even register on the senses of most sapient beings. It was an aura of softness and humility, of a being that understood that it was, ultimately, just a single spark in a great cosmic fire.Humility, kindness, and diligence were the keys.The first respondent was a single sparrow that landed on her shoulders. Then a moth fluttered up and sat in her hair. The creatures stared out at the encroaching Wyld which, at the moment, seemed convinced that it owned the planet and knew what was best for it.Jun didn't move. She continued to chant softly in supplication even as a curious centipede crawled up her leg. Several grasshoppers leaped up to her mage's hood and, using it as footing, crawled up to her shoulders to observe the petulant demigod. What an odd thing.As the seconds went by, flies and gnats started to form little swarms around her. A curious lizard leaped up  her front and crawled onto her wrist. It too watched the Wyld. What was the Wyld? Did it think it knew what was best for these creatures?About a minute went by, and progressively larger and larger animals began to appear, curious about the still, supplicant human. Several rats, then a deer, and eventually a pride of lions. Soon the ground around Jun was covered in orbiting shadows as vultures, song birds, and hawks circled above her.There was more to it than animals. While Daedalus' power blackened the earth from one side, the earth around Jun became increasingly verdant. Grass turned greener, trees became taller, vines and roots grew with such fervor that they trembled the earth around her.Closer to the Wyld, the grass and trees would begin to wither and dry in a manner similar to when Daedalus had discovered druidic energy. But for every blade of grass that shriveled, a new one formed closer to Jun. From the sky it would look like nature itself was retreating from the Wyld before it could control it.And this was Jun's intention, to deprive the Wyld of natural energy, of things for it to slave to its will, to turn the very thing the Wyld was attempting to absorb against it in a pocket of resistance. The end result of Jun's distress signal would be a field of natural energy where the plants and animals were greatly empowered. The wolves, wildebeests, snakes, and all manner of creeping things would begin exhibiting faint auras of fire and flame. They stood in front of the field as a phalanx. Many of these creatures were the very same that the Knights of the Harvest and the high priestess in charge of the TERRA's network had thoughtfully assured the safety of. The grass and trees twisted into the earth like clenched fists ready for battle. The creatures of the air too would start to swirl in various formations, alight with a new and untold power, waiting for the right time to be unleashed.There was one last side effect of the concentration of natural energy. With all the life force concentrating around Jun and away from the Wyld, the whithered and dry grass would allow the ever expanding circle of mounted archers to ride quickly and trample through more terrain without slowing down. It would also greatly magnify the speed with which the TERRA's holy flames could spread to counter the Wyld.Of course if the Wyld didn't want to have to deal with any of this, it was free to focus on the northern side of the Expanse, which was becoming increasingly infected with disease and death, things which the Wyld probably hated as much as any other organisms.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"Wow...

These forms seemed to leap out of the hearts of the creatures and rush forward like an army of ghosts. Phantoms of pure light and fire, these creatures would collide with the Wyld, headbutting, biting, stomping and gnashing their way through anything dark and evil, and then detonating with a burst of holy flames. These forms were not made of nature energy themselves, but were a power gifted to the creatures through a synergistic effect with Jun. Jun had absorbed the energy and used it to become a living wand, a weapon used by the earth itself through a mystical contract. This was her ultimate power that she could only use during the most desperate of occasions, the most powerful ability she had learned from Va'nei.Of course, the flood of fiery beasts was just the beginning. Even more dramatic would be the flock of dive bombing eagles, hawks, swallows, doves, crows, and many other species just above the edge of the Wyld. Their auras made them seem like phoenixes rather than mundane fowl. Just before they reached the Wyld they would pull up, but their auras kept going, showering the Wyld with thousands of missiles of avian fire. The explosions could be heard from the other side of the Wyld even through the TERRA's ring of fire, letting Daedalus know that his distraction had been put to good use. The darkened sky, filled with empowered fowl, also made a nice contrast against the tempestuous sea of fire forming below.The insects and plants played their role as well. The swarms formed a collective consciousness that swam through the air like a great glowing cloud of fire flies. Like the other creatures, they unleashed holy, fiery spectres forward, and a hail of stars flowed into the Wyld, eating into its vines like hungry locusts.Finally, the vines and roots of the earth rose up like writhing wings on both sides of Jun's little anti-Wyld. They tore the earth apart into great chunks. But these chunks looked a bit different from regular earth, as did the auras of the plants; both became emerald and crystalline. The vines and roots catapulted this holy earth forward, and as it landed among the forms of the Wyld it would shatter into deadly shrapnel, painfully burning and sapping all things of malevolent intent.

The horrifying yet short screams of unpossessed men and women echo throughout the plains, until the spell's effects abate.

The hordes withdraw as the spell finally runs its course, the great palisades of vines opening up for mere moments to let the shambling masses through.

At this point, the forests that the Valkyries are attempting to burn have been completely overrun, and so the loss of those vines is negligible compared to the whole. Andraste gestures to the sky with her onyx-tipped staff as she senses the incoming Valkyries, and dark stormheads abruptly fill the air above the newly-created fortress, crackling with sickly purple lightning, unnaturally black and gloomy. They begin to descend and encompass the Wyld's new fortifications, swirling about and pouring over the area, falling almost gently in a grand semicircle just outside the viney wall. Any caught within the massive circular wall of vines will find themselves unable to retreat, swarmed by angry crows or overcome by whipping tendrils, as a massive stormy barrier of smoke and smog encapsulates the area, the great crackling dome obscuring it from view. Even light magic and flames cannot penetrate the barrier, reinforced as it is by an ancient and unbelievably powerful magic, the very same that contributed so greatly the the collapse of the world once before.Any living beings who attempt to enter will curiously find themselves able to do so, although doing so will almost certainly mean a quick yet painful assimilation. Andraste finally retreats herself, leaping over the wall and vanishing into the smoggy veil. An unearthly silence falls over the battlefield, the only sounds the occasional caw of a crow and the sizzling of charred plantlife. It seems, for now, that the Wyld has been repelled, shored up as it is behind its new wall.

We had a meeting and they explained that it's some kind of demigodic entity. It hates sapient life. It wants to revert the natural world to a primal state, without any intelligence, just instinct. It chose the Expanse so it could feed off all the natural energy here, and use it to assimilate all the life forms. It's only vulnerable to fire and light. It just eats everything else.\" She leered at it, as if that would somehow damage it further. \"It's a real pain in the nether regions.

Please\u00a0treat with patience those who may express fear or hatred of your forces, especially young children and the elderly. There are some among the latter who have been traumatized by undead forces in their youth. Please deal with them tactfully and compassionately if you are able to do so.Thank you for taking the time to read this message. Long live Van'ei. Long live Gaia.
