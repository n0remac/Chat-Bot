Down the main road, a supply chain is being assembled to supply Isra\u2019s secondary offensive, bringing Isra\u2019s logistics personnel into the area. Lookout for single individuals is especially high in the southern portion of the Free Plains, as it is suspected that if Goraia will make an attack, it will be a small team - or even just a single individual - intending to attempt a decapitation strike. The defenses of the Southern Gate are also more numerous relative to other regions. As such, the scouts would find it difficult to proceed safely. Griffin lookout patrols have been temporarily increased in the south, and the farms are only located near to the river; the rest of the plains are simply plains, without as much vegetation as all that. With griffin's passing overhead at regular intervals, the scouts would find it challenging to find locations to hide among the grasses.All of this would become apparent to the bandits quite early on, and in favoring caution over speed, moving forward is exceptionally slow. As they proceed and get closer to the Silverion River and the city itself, it would become apparent that Isra is very much on guard for intruders from the south, and is prepared to repel a small army. While the scouts may be able to sneak back to safety the way they came, approaching Isra from the south seems exceptionally hazardous.Seeing as this side was much too patrolled and watched, both teams sneaked back before they got too close, or otherwise passed the \"point-of-no-return.\" It was made clear that this wouldn't be the direction to enter, however, it did them good to know that the southern side had a large force and that they should avoid this area in the future. Once far enough and safe from imminent danger, the four regrouped to discuss their next course of action. Nothing was stopping them from trying a different approach or at a later time.They dispersed back into uncontrolled land from which they had came from.<Exit>After the mild disappointment of trying to get into Isra from its south and being unsuccessful, the group of four bandits went to see how the Land Tiller's forest was. The terrain was much more unfamiliar to them then the last try, but previous experience travelling and fighting in woodlands didn't leave them clueless.

Down the main road, a supply chain is being assembled to supply Isra\u2019s secondary offensive, bringing Isra\u2019s logistics personnel into the area. Lookout for single individuals is especially high in the southern portion of the Free Plains, as it is suspected that if Goraia will make an attack, it will be a small team - or even just a single individual - intending to attempt a decapitation strike. The defenses of the <a href=\"http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1602/southern-gate-post-first?page=3\" rel=\"norewrite\" target=\"_blank\">Southern Gate</a> are also more numerous relative to other regions. <br><br/>As such, the scouts would find it difficult to proceed safely. Griffin lookout patrols have been temporarily increased in the south, and the farms are only located near to the river; the rest of the plains are simply plains, without as much vegetation as all that. With griffin's passing overhead at regular intervals, the scouts would find it challenging to find locations to hide among the grasses.<br/><br/>All of this would become apparent to the bandits quite early on, and in favoring caution over speed, moving forward is exceptionally slow. As they proceed and get closer to the Silverion River and the city itself, it would become apparent that Isra is very much on guard for intruders from the south, and is prepared to repel a small army. <br/><br/>While the scouts may be able to sneak back to safety the way they came, approaching Isra from the south seems exceptionally hazardous.<div class=\"quote_clear\"></div></br></div></div>Seeing as this side was much too patrolled and watched, both teams sneaked back before they got too close, or otherwise passed the \"point-of-no-return.\" It was made clear that this wouldn't be the direction to enter, however, it did them good to know that the southern side had a large force and that they should avoid this area in the future.

Jonsie wasn't sure why the strange, reclusive man had the puppets or what he did with them, and he was certainly sure that he didn't want to know. The man had been out here longer than any of the other guards, and spoke to the puppets more than people.Having never been the philosophical sort, Jonsie couldn't really grasp exactly what Brea was talking about when she went on about being inside dreams and nightmares. It really did sound like she was talking about the strange visions brought about from eating those odd greenish mushrooms that grew in the woods, but she spoke with such conviction that he almost wondered if she was telling the truth. Still, it was only when she stopped abruptly that he realized that he'd been hanging onto her every word. Her question caught him off-guard, and he hesitated for a moment before responding.\"Me? Why do you ask? Uh...well, I don't really remember my dreams very often...mostly mundane things, I guess. I'm, uh, not really quite sure...\"This was a lie, and Jonsie had always been a terrible liar. Every night he would dream of flying through the air, of going on grand adventures and rescuing beautiful women from monstrous beasts and hidden lairs. He dreamed of standing at the helm of a ship as he sailed across uncharted seas, and of diving deep beneath the ocean's depths to find sunken treasure chests. Of course, all these things seemed childish and silly under the harsh light of day, and he couldn't bring himself to talk about them with anyone, much less this strange woman that he'd just met.

If you only know of the world from your dreams, I'm afraid that reality is often very disappointing.

If he hadn't come out here, he would have never met her.\"Tell me, Miss Kalai...where are you going? If you don't know where you're coming from, do you have a place in mind to go?

It whole plant-thing was going to take some getting used to. She turned her attention inward, wondering if she was hungry, and if that felt any different from how she remembered it feeling as a young girl. She let her mind wander to the other Oneri, still trapped under the oppression of that horrid, dark mind, the Jungle One, pressing down on their souls like a vice, shaped perfectly to inflict the most torment... She had not known names - they had not had names, except for titles, or those they had pulled from dreams when they could reach through the Hypnogoge, just enough to peer in on a dream, like listening to a conversation muffled through a wall. She had remembered dreams of all that humans were capable of inflicting on one another. War, rape, murder, theft, arson - all these images flashed before her mind as she walked amid the dappled shadows of the swamp. But, others too, with them. A newborn child. A first kiss. The finishing touches on a painting. The movement in a dance. The smell of fresh bread (which she was now very eager to try). It was nothing like a read childhood, but it would have to do. Light and shadow. Good and bad. Humanity seemed to be as dappled as the forest. Jonsie seemed kind, more like light than shadow. But he had said also that reality was disappointing... She looked down at herself, not realizing that she had stopped moving, having come to rest underneath a huge willow tree whose branches curved gently and nearly touched the ground again, flitting across the long grass like the caress of a lover.She shook her head fiercely and exhaled sharply. None of that. She collected her thoughts and ordered them again in her mind, slotting them away like books on a shelf, then glanced at the sun, to see that it was just beginning to kiss the horizon. She ran back to the guardhouse, the leaves that made up her \"skin\" yellowing a bit at the edges at her exertion. Ah, like humans getting red. At least she didn't sweat anymore - a small thing to be thankful for. She poked her head inside of one building, only to find that it was a shower, and stood, frozen for a moment, before realizing that that wasn't okay, and then bolting, her face-petals turning a dark green and shedding a spray of pollen.

He pulled his hand out of his pocket, revealing a felt hand puppet in the shape of a storybook princess. Raising the puppet to his lips, he began to whisper inaudibly to it, but the rest of the guards paid him no mind. Jonsie gestured for Brea to follow him to the kitchen, pointedly ignoring the snickers of his coworkers.\"I'm afraid we haven't got a lot of variety when it comes to food out here,\" he said. \"Dinner tonight is turnip soup and bread.

He didn't want to face the ridicule and snide remarks of the other guards, and the prospect of having a meal alone with her appealed to him. There was a small table outside the outpost, usually used for signing cargo manifests, that offered a perfect view of the setting sun. Gesturing for Brea to have a seat, Jonsie put down his turnip soup and sat down opposite her.\"So, Miss Kalai,\" he said after an awkward pause. \"Where shall we go?
