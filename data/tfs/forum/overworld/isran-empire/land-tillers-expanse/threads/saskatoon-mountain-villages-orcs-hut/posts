Wronged of his right to die peacefully, and so he lives in sleepless existence.\" Looking back to Zar'Dura, his eyes tensed as if hinting at her importance, continuing to speak.\"And from there, I lost Thrashnald, for the Queen had separated us. A dragon, forged from the decayed corpses of the realm. She breathed... she breathed death. This was truly a horror to witness. And I will not be questioned further of this.\" He looked back up to the others, his face in much pain and agony as he continued. \"I do not know of my wife, my brethren, my children my fathers my ancestors- Anything.

Shadow... Chains... and Pain..The only things that a soul like Theev'Nok's could endure anymore. A soul, with body, yes, in this realm. He didn't know where he was, but he knew the walls. The walls, now so comfortable to him. He could remember every brick on each wall without having to could halfway this time. Rather, even counting the first brick he would know. But the roof.. the roof to this small room was gone.. and shadow was all that was there.Theev'Nok's arms were stretched out and upwards, his head hanging as he tried to hang himself, giving his feet rest. But to no avail, as his feet seemed to be cuffed and planted there, chains wrapping around them as well. His face.. if any could've seen his face at that time, none would've believed it would be Theev'Nok. Not only had half of it been ripped apart, but through Theev'Nok's own eyes could he see the fibers and red flesh in between where his knows was supposed to be.\u00a0And still he'd hang there, thinking of agony. Still, to this day, the creatures who imprisoned him would not let him be forgiven. Zar'Dura.. he made her die. Because of him, Thrashnald had killed her, and his life was damned for barbaric and unceasing agony. The breathing Theev'Nok cast out was sputtered and random, as it was a reaction to the ever-growing pain within his head, his heartbeat pounding through his ears and making his wrists cry out, not an ounce of circulation getting by.And he would think again. Think of how he could've defeated Thrashnald. How he should've\u00a0defeated Thrashnald. How his friends have longed for him, and how the Chieftan would've reacted. Would they give him an honorable ceremony? Within the middle of his thoughts, hoping for an honorable ceremony for the fiftieth time, the beast once more came out from the shadows and sent a mighty hand across Theev'Nok's face, hearing his neck snap a dozen times once more.\"You're putrid thoughts disturb me, fleshling.\"\u00a0A Minotaur, bred from both horror and bile. A creature buried within the depths of damnation and agony. A true priest of all that was evil and wrong. And Theev'Nok was unfortunate enough to have been judged by such a creature. The monster spoke with a powerful voice, shaking the ears upon Theev'Nok's head, his chest vibrating and his throat letting out a groan from the painful vibration it too received.The monster looked down upon the mighty Theev'Nok, for he was a tall and monstrous creature. His face showed nothing more but intentions to maim and disgust. After all, who was an orc like Theev'Nok's self to be brought forth to such a perfect bringer of death?But then, as the Minotaur was beginning to speak once more, something was different. The monster turned around to witness the wall crackling apart in the middle, which made Theev'Nok raise his head in wonder and surprise. The last time such a wall had opened was to bring the Minotaur here, but now.. now he saw something..Light.A path leading towards a pillar of light. Theev'Nok suddenly fell to the ground, for the chains upon him were gone. Whipping around in instinct, the Minotaur lifted Theev'Nok high into the air, a hand clutched mightily around his throat as he left Theev'Nok dangling a dangerous height. But from there, from there, Theev'Nok found something new. Strength. A mighty, swift kick was delivered just above the collar bone of the Minotaur, who grunted and barely loosened his grip upon the orc.But it was enough to gain a wheezing breath. From there, he kicked again, and then again, until suddenly the Minotaur absent-mindedly hurled him behind itself, grasping onto its throat for a moment before turning around to stare with a judging growl at Theev'Nok, who with much fear began sprinting to the pillar of light.The last thing Theev'Nok heard before leaping into such a pillar was the horrifying, echoing roar of the Minotaur, which would've easily made the orc fall to the ground and drain him of all his strength both internally and externally, but Theev'Nok was already within the air when such a roar was started, falling limply into the light.And from there, the orc was thrown from Zar'Dura across the fire, colliding with the ground and dragging for a moment.Theev'Nok cried the weakest cry one could hear, barely a silent cough. After a few moments, his hand lifted up, looking to the ground. Color... real color. Dirt, yes, but color. Brown. His hand slid across it, moving it around before grabbing a handful, wide eyed as his body turned to sit upwards, facing the ground as his chest began pumping air once more. He clutched onto his face to feel no missing chunks, to feel flesh without pain. His body was returned to him. The stitches were gone, Thorok could see at least, when the Brute turned around to look at the three.And from there, not only did he see Daris'Fall and Thorok, but he saw Zar'Dura. From there, a stutter was heard, and his vision was blurred, and he reached a hand out to Zar'Dura with wonder, confusion, and happiness, before he collapsed from a faint. Apparently that strength the warrior had in the physical realm was drained from the Minotaur's last roar, and none could truly know the time it'd take to return his strength.Thorok rushed to him, looking into his dull, absent eyes to see that his was Theev'Nok, kneeling down by his head as he looked up to Zar'Dura with wide eyes. \"Zar'Dura... the Listener indeed!\" His face lit up with joy. \"Your title proves true,my child.\" He snapped his head back down to Theev'Nok with worry, analyzing him to see how permanent this unconsciousness was. \"A faint, that is all, I know.\" He said, clutching around the side of Theev'Nok's now unstitched neck, feeling a weak pulse. \"But he is weak.. something has taken his strength for now..\" He let go of his neck to let the circulation take its course, looking back up to Zar'Dura with much gratefulness.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wHwObOlhXkg/T3Q5WGxQj2I/AAAAAAAAKmQ/XKLe1LsncAU/s1600/minotaur01.jpg"], "html": "Bricks....

You followed no traditions of my people, for there were NONE of my people! You were and still exist as a pup, growing in the world without its pack.\" From that last word, strains of saliva shot out from his mouth, staring to where they fell with sudden focus.Staring back up, he felt tension around his mouth. Had he dared to bare fangs towards the last two of his once-tribe? His face suddenly caught realization, calming down now, eyes glossed with regret as he looked to them, and then turned back over his shoulder to Theev'Nok, who lied there weak and asleep. \".....There are no people, there are no traditions...\" Turning back, he stared to both of them, a reddish-pinkness coming to his eyes now. \"And I, am not, your Thuri.\" His hand pointed to the ground with the last sentence, fidgeting with the last two words. He grew silent, expecting no response after waiting for a second or two, huffing as he walked his way at least eight feet back to where Theev'Nok was, crossing his legs as his spear was nearby him now, staring to Theev'Nok's limp body as he pondered the words he spoke.

Spinning around, his eyes lit up, remembering the fate he happened to not have sentenced her to. Joy filled him, and he leapt from the tree, landing down with a fist punching into the ground.

The reaping of Thorok's blood, to call him \"poisoned\" proved that if any honor was there in the beginning, than it surely died out, proving that the kin of such a warrior wouldn't truly have carried on Thorok's own previous greatness downforth. But yet, even as that simmered in Theev'Nok's head, he let it corrupt his mindset, causing his face to crunch and growl as he couldn't bear the intolerance, nor the rebellious nature, that this child bared.And from there Theev'Nok grew even more angry as his walk went astray, continuing to search for Thorok as he thought upon Daris' action. He spoke so proudly, so dignified, as if he was a Thuri of some people. And with how they spoke.. with how the young minds spoke.. it truly sunk into Theev'Nok's mind that whatever their honor bore, it was not of righteousness. The way Daris grinned to Theev'Nok completely put him off, images of how he possibly had and would continue to corrupt his own little Listener filling his head.Much angrier now, Theev'Nok bellowed out Thorok's name into the wilderness, sending rabbits astray as well as birds to the air. He continued to look around before he found his Thuri, within a small opening in the wooded area around them. The pillar sighed, his face calming to a neutral-depressed state, his hand reaching up to the tree beside him as he took one step into the sunlit grass.And there, and there would Thorok stand. His legs coated with dried blood from the stag, his muscles clenched together as his spear gripped heavily in his arm. His eyes glared to the floor below him, his back seen expanding and shrinking, as Theev'Nok came to see Thorok from behind. But within Thorok's own mind had a completely melancholy state taken course. At first, at first he considered his cousin's loss. How now, rather than a desire for his people, he found himself content to live alone with another, considering that his own desires were all a cub in this world should focus on. At that moment did another thought come across his mind, how he regretted ever considering such a boy as the next to take his own place. And then his mind traveled to Zar'Dura as Theev'Nok continued to stare in silence. How she at least understood, which surprised him with how the she-orc bared such a more caring nature towards him than that of his own blood.At that moment, physically, his arm  clenched around his spear, his entire arm flexed with all the aggression it could onto his weapon, his other hand clenching into itself so that the rage within drew blood from his palm, trailing down to his knuckles. From there, Theev'Nok's heavy intake of air was heard, where Thorok's left ear twitched, before his own lips parted:\"It felt like forever... that I would walk among a land of udder nightmare and chaos.. that my people had fallen to whatever creatures consumed such a realm.. and now... and now I imagine them better off dead...\" His body took a left step backwards before turning back to Theev'Nok, his eyes consumed with a fire burning inside. A fire that seemed to only feed more and more upon the hatred that was now consuming Thorok, rather than that of desperation and agony. \"Tell me how to stop this.\" His voice grew to nearly break at that moment, his head lowered as he continued to stare to Theev'Nok.At that moment did Theev'Nok continue to march forward, until his entire figure was within the light. \".... I cannot.\" He spoke suddenly, making Thorok instantly react with a sigh. \"I remember you, I remember you strong, and proud. A leader whom we all kissed the ground beneath. A warrior who kept us safe, as a fam-\" \"Do not, speak to me of family-\" \"My Thuri-\"With a sudden roar, the Chieftan threw his spear into the air, wizzing by Theev'Nok's head. His chest pumped up as his teeth were bared. \"I!! AM NOT!! YOUR LEADER!!!!\" The roar echoed throughout the woods nearby, and from there, a weakness consumed Thorok. At that moment did he feel his spirit drifting, as his knees connected to the ground, his body falling forward and his elbows dug into the dirt. Finding Theev'Nok's foot, he clutched to it with all the strength he had at that moment, which was little. \"......Save me, Theev'Nok....\" He whispered out. A sigh came from Theev'Nok, looking away for a moment before a sudden snapping of a branch above them came to Thorok's ears.Looking above, he would see Theev'Nok The Brute, with a sharp branch in his hands, launching it high into the air before grunting heavily as he brought it down upon Thorok. At this time, Thorok's instant reaction was to clutch onto the branch, feeling it punch his stomach. But yet, he felt no death, which made him believe he caught it in time. Theev'Nok, who leaned over now to look to Thorok's eyes, his own returning to a calmer state. \"This is as much as I can help you, my Thuri.\" With that, the brute let go of the large stake, turning around to march his way back to where he found their hut.And right there, Thorok's head fell to the ground, sighing before a coughing grew from lack of strength. Lack of strength to barely hold back tears. Looking to his left, he sighed as he tried to throw the branch, but yet, grunted once he found out such did not happen. Looking back to his stomach did he see how the branch had entered him, where his eyes narrowed, his irises glowing with sudden awe. Using a new strength that crawled into his veins from adrenaline, he slowly witnessed the branch exiting his body, leaving his skin to be that of untouched. And at that moment would Thorok launch upwards, standing up and looking around with the branch tight in his right hand.\u00a0The blessing. The power that was blessed to the Chieftan and he alone. That no orc of his tribe shall maim nor end him. At that moment did heavy, rapid breaths embrace Thorok, looking around for a moment before staring back down to his stomach. His head was growing dizzy, stumbling as he leaned against a tree. At that moment, so many thoughts raced through his head. At first, he was glad of this. And then, then Thorok realized what this meant. His people. A people of yore, who still lived, somewhere. Somewhere, lost, yes, but not gone. And at that moment did Thorok look to the branch before dropping it to look at his hand. Clutching his forearm with his scarred hand, he brought that which held the branch closer to his face. And at that moment, at that moment did he accept what was true, and what was farce. Dropping his hands to his sides, he looked upwards, and then to his legs, seeing how his appearance was quite informal. With that, the Chieftan marched through the forest, for the time being. After all, he had some more cleaning up to do.\u00a0Theev'Nok, who was standing nearby the hut, bouncing on his feet as he tried to wash away the growing disappointment he had in the Chieftan's cousin, shook his head as he walked back onto the grounds in front of the hut, looking for the both of them for the new he would have brought now. Likewise, his spirit was calm and his body relaxed, though an upset mood was within his eyes as he gazed around for his kin.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "But yet, despite all that was said, there was losso f one truth.
