This home is heavily fortified against the elements and remains at a stable temperature in all weather. In some ways this makes it an underground home. However, there are many openings, including two large windows that face the East so that the sun may great the inhabitant as he wakes. The chambers are lightly furnished with basic wooden trappings and cloth and down cushioning.A small river runs through the front of the home, providing an excellent source of irrigation. Enigma will be asked to till the land as best as possible, and make use of it to grow crops, in exchange for his otherwise peaceful habitation in the Expanse.Patrolling this area, about an acre out all around, is a group of mercenaries and some ballistae, ready to defend Enigma against his supposed \"pursuer\". Only Raynor, the highest ranking commanders, and Elder Havador know his secret. There are also mages present, instructed by Jun on possible tactics to use against the anti-magic beast, as well as several healing personnel.
