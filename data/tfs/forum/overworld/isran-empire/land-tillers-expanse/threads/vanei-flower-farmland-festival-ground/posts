We have one day to get this thing built! Now get your Arian asses moving!\", one of the Arian beings commanders shouted multiple times through the day. After busting their asses all day, the fruit of their labor was before them. A large, circular, stone building had been built. Four holes acted like windows in the structure, letting the wind blow through, cooling the inside and carry the food smell to the nostrils of the visitors. On top was a large hole with a raised roof above it; this was designed to let the heat out of the building like a vent pipe for a stove. Inside, they had built a stone over and many counter tops. Everything was built from stone except the seats the eaters would sit at. Three of the beings went inside of the structure while the rest began to milk the Archaniox Rhinos and unload carts to prep what food they could outside. Small stone wheels for grinding various grains for breads were being built, chains for hanging meat were being hung, pots for cooking food were being carried inside, and all the various items needed for prep work would begin.\"We need to cure those ovens and get the bread going. We have less than sixteen hours to be producing food for thousands. I expect to be ready to start cooking in one hour.\"Vengelixo was a calm being, but like any creature of war, he didn't mind a good fight here and there. Vengelixo went and found the commander who was driving the group to work harder. For about forty minutes the two would have it out, sparring as if it was a real fight with swords and fist. Metal clanged and loud thuds were heard as the two slung eachother around like ragdolls. The two eight and a half feet tall dragon like humanoids were having fun, knowing their bodies would heal all the bruising and minor wounds within two hours after the fight.Vengelixo would wash up in a barrel of water and head into the structure. The smell of bread passed through the air, intermingling with the various scents of meats being smoked and boiled. The seasonings blended so well despite their normal contrasts when on the same plate. It all seemed so normal, except the cooking equipment. The Arian's seemed to have learned how to use fire and the actual beings themselves were heating the pots and pans while one cooked; holding these pots and pans for hours took great strength and discipline. The ovens and smokers were heated by wood and coal.\u00a0The next day...The Land Tiller's State was beautiful place. The plant life was abundant and the serenity of the place could calm a dragon. The aromas of all the foods were meshing together, pulling people in all directions. The Arians, wearing their chef hats, were cleaning up the outside of the building, sweeping the floors, and readying the place to open as if it was a permanent restaurant.\u00a0Unlike many others, the Arian Kiraxans would showcase their meals according to the time of day. They would serve a Breakfast, Lunch, Appetizer, Dinner, and then Desert. Each meal would be served with a drink fit best for that meal according to their species.Breakfast:Freshly baked croissant with a light blueberry icing with a crystallized sugar coated assortment of raspberries, blackberries, and chopped strawberries, topped with a dollup of whipped cream. Served with this meal is a bowl of roasted cinnamon oats with chunks of apple and mango, decorated by two swirls of vanilla icing that would stem from a vanilla flower floating in the center of the bowl. Your drink will be your choice; orange juice or a sweet blue wine.Lunch:A split 9-grain italian style loaf that contained hemp seed giving people a better appetite, filled with thinly sliced blue dragon tail, Archaniox white cheese, a bright green leaf similar to lettuce, purple onions, roasted red peppers, yellow striped tomatoes, red onions, with a 4 pepper sauce to bring it all together. For the side, a bowl of soup made from the dragon meat, dragon bonestock, and finely diced vegetables. The drink served is a heavy brew known as Blitzger's Brew that is much like Guiness, but with a much lighter taste, all to compliment the sandwich as the tastes fuse with the brew.Appetizer:Thinly sliced Archaniox roast beef rolled with Archaniox yellow cheese and coated with a garlic butter, rolled in a croissant style bread. Approximately 3, 2\" rolls per plate.Dinner:\u00a0Honey Ta(moonshine) marinated medium rare 7oz Blue Dragon Ribeye steak topped with a garlic sauce and parsley. To compliment this juicy slab of meat is a mashed purple cauliflower and red potatos dressed with the Dragon Au Jus created from the dragon meats juices; a cob of corn with a sweet butter and salt, and a Sourdough roll with sweetbutter on it's golden top. Served with White Wine, Blitzgers Brew, or Sylvak Ta(Moonshine).\u00a0Dessert:A choice of two pies-Apple and Mango pie with graham crust and flaky, sugar coated, thin lattice top to hold it all in places. With each piece of pie is offered whip cream.A four berry pie made from strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and blackberries. It has a solid topping and sweet, flaky, crust. Whip cream is also served with this desert.-------------------It would seem as though these ugly, giant, dragon like beings could cook some food. They were diligent and patient, crafting each piece like a piece of art. A bunch of artists in their chef hats, and they hoped everyone else enjoyed their foods just as much as they did.

Not much was known about them except for the very obvious affliction they suffered from. Rumor had it that they were given the all clear by the priestess of the Temple of the Phoenix. But it was still hard for the older generation to let go of their innate fear of the undead.However, that stigma was easily overcome by the innate love that younger people had of cakes. They were the first to try them, and the first to proclaim the magnificence of the deserts. The ambassador could expect to be sold out very quickly. This gesture went a long way in solidifying the friendship of the people.Next was\u00a0Levi Thunderstruck, a hero rumored to come from Aaedan. Unfortunately Aaedan and the Land-Tillers were on awkward terms. The Phoenix State had gone to war with Aaedan (with only limited backing from the Land-Tillers) and so had been on opposite sides of the battlefield. That said, this was a long time ago. Levi was here now, completely vulnerable, making tolito wraps.And amazing wraps they were, for some. Many Land-Tillers had odd diets compared to outsiders. It wasn't uncommon for some of them to be vegetarian or eat edible insects. To eat something so full of meat was an awkward event for some and absolute bliss for others. \"Maybe instead of working with our animals we should be eating them!\" A few people joked. The boar and haggis were unfortunately less well-received. But the Tolito Wraps were just too good to pass up.Finally came mister\u00a0Vangelixo Novarick and his entourage of... dragon men?! Frankly a lot of people were afraid to go near him. But his food spoke for itself, and so did the small building.The fact that he managed to construct a functional restaurant in one night was impressive, considering he didn't use earth magic. (A few of the Tillers scoffed that their mages could have done better.)Once again, there was lots of meat. Lots of very good meat. Dragons were rare in the Expanse. Mostly what they had access to were small wyverns, which were too rare and valuable as mounts to be used as food. The prospect of tasting real dragon meat would send lots of people scrambling for more. (Not to mention the fact that dragons were once the enemies of the Land-Tillers, so to eat them gave some members of the older generation a sadistic pleasure.)A few of the farmers were particularly pleased to see that the Phoenix Imperium was starting to produce viable, impressive produce. The methods the Land-Tillers taught them resulted in some excellent fruits and vegetables. Their vibrant taste shined through perfectly in the berry, apple, and mango pies, croissants, stews, mashed vegetables, and even the alcohol.

Those rare times his happiness slipped had been times of great stress for the tribe.The most notable had been the time he was stirred to anger. There is an old saying: There are three things all wise men fear. The sea in storm, a night with no moon, and the anger of a gentle man. Talis though careless was an exceedingly gentle soul. One day though a group of bullies went too far. They had hurt one of his friends seriously. Talis had a natural empathy with nature spirits, particularly those of a more destructive nature. He had nearly killed the bullies before he had been stopped. It had also taken several older summoners to put an end to his rampage. Since that day the tribe had treated Talis differently. They had seen the destruction he was capable of and it had frightened them. They were meant to be guardians of the earth and of the Land Tillers. His power though wasn't suited to guarding or preserving nature. His power embodied a part of nature the rest of the clan liked to pretend didn't exist.
