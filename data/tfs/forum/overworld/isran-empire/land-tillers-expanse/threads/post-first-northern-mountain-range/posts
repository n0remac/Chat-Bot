The more one practiced these stances the more easily one would be able to resonate one's magic with the will of the earth. Since Zagarus was already an experienced mage, this would probably be the most difficult and important lesson; subsequent lessons would be much easier.After a good night's rest, Sangilak would have them move on to the second village.The second village had already received medical treatment, and so everyone was ok. But there were still some problems.\"Same deal as last time. Using whatever skills you have, help out as much as you can.\"An old man had lost his prized yak. (It was stuck in a ravine, frightened there by the commotion.)The local bridge had been destroyed.Several children were traumatized and refused to leave their bedrooms.The sheep and goat fences were destroyed, and the farmers needed help rounding the animals back up.The fences themselves needed fixing.Once again, Zagarus was allowed to whatever resources he had in order to help the villagers. He did not have to succeed in all the tasks, but the more he succeeded at the more Sangilak would like him.

Once you feel connected to the earth, you need to harmonize your mana with it. The earth has its own spirit, its own mana field, if you will. And you need to intersperse yours with its. You can't just force your mana into the earth, it has to let you in. It's like, it's like you're gaining its trust so to speak. Having a large mana pool definitely helps, but it also takes the right attitude towards the earth.\"Sangilak would demonstrate by allowing her mana to flow into the ground around her. She would stretch out her palms and then raise them, causing large clumps of earth to come out of the earth. Then she would tighten her palms into a fist, causing the earth to become concentrated into tight little spheres. Then she would hurl the spheres at another boulder. Surprisingly the boulder would crack. She'd carefully place the earth back into its original source.\"I'm not sure what your learning style is when it comes to magic. If you're more of an intellectual, like most wizards, you might take pleasure in reading about different kinds of soil, minerals, and elements and their various properties, as well as geological processes. It doesn't have to be a strictly intuitive or emotional endeavor. What matters the most is the fact that you show your respect for the earth in some way. And of course, practice. Having a stubborn personality helps too. I find the earth is a rather stubborn entity sometimes.\"They would continue training for several hours, until finally they needed to rest. Sangilak would start to ask various inquiries about Zagarus and his life. Where was he from? Did he have a family? How did he start learning magic? She was starting to like the guy, regardless of his answers.***By the time they woke up the next night and made it to the third and final village, everything would be mostly in order. The rest of Sangilak's forces would have taken care of most of the work. There were however still some tasks which needed to be done. Again, Zagarus did not have to be successful in all of them:One of the wealthier families had lost a prized statue of Va'nei the Earthwarden. They wanted either a replacement or to be compensated somehow; they were arguing with the local militia.Some of the young people wanted free magic lessons (in an element other than Earth) since the Guardian Tower was a bit far for them and they didn't want to leave their farms. They wanted to be more useful in case of another attack.An old warrior had been killed in battle. His body was already buried. It was tradition for the youngest granddaughter to leave some flowers on top of the grave site, but the girl was only five and too sad and scared. She wanted the hero who defeated the beast to go with her.Finally, an old woman who had a reputation for being a seer predicted that something terrible would happen in the Expanse soon, and that Zagarus would be part of it. Her predictions were not always correct (about 70%), and it was felt that someone should convince her that their helper was trustworthy.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Sangilak gave Zagarus a pleased grip on the shoulder.

He would have to practice a lot, but such was part of the purpose for his journey.During their training, he began to open up a small bit to her curiosity. He had explained with honesty who he was, how he came from Goraia, and how he had managed to keep his position through the regime change. He spoke a small bit about the late Lord Zephidel, some of the disagreements he had with him, and of the current Empress Jill. And he, too, had questions about her background as well. Who was she and what was the general history of these lands? When did she begin this training and who had taught it to her?Concerning the lost statue, Zagarus was able to compensate for it monetarily, a small answer to a bigger emotional problem, but there was little else to be done. He would go over the basics of magic with the younger folk, particularly on how to prepare one's mind to begin learning, emphasizing how little time there really was to teach. Yet during this time, he also shared some basic melee self-defense. When it came time for the girl to leave flowers upon the grave, he had no issue holding her hand and walking her to the fallen warrior's grave.Finally, he had hoped his discussion with Sangilak, and his help around the village, would help give him the leverage needed for the old woman seeress to listen to his suggestion. Zagarus suggested in a very friendly way that perhaps what may soon happen to the Expanse may indeed involve himself, but that should such be the case, he would be involved in again defending the local populace.

It was all very interesting, to meet someone who was from the original Medanese government who hadn't been overthrown. Of course she had many questions, like what was the status of the people and if the rumors of rampant human rights violations were true.But with all that said, she couldn't forget that this stranger had helped out her people and didn't try to hide his identity. He took a big risk. She decided to reward him by telling him about herself. She was the youngest Elder of the Land-Tiller State's Elder Council, one of the most powerful earth mages in the Expanse, and the proud adopted mother of an orphan child named Uglu. Knowledge of earth magic had always been a part of the Saskatoon Clan's tradition, but she also received more advanced training form the Guardian Tower. The lands themselves were thousands of years old, and originally founded by a group of humans and elves who wanted to live in peace with nature. They were blessed by a powerful dragon named Va'nei the Earthwarden, who had recently awoken and now helped protect these lands.Zagarus' melee lessons did not go unnoticed, and neither did him walking with the little girl. The seer was skeptical, but put at ease for the moment. Sangilak decided not to tell the rest of the villagers that he was from Goraia just yet. The Land-Tillers were very much on the fence when it came to that mysterious nation. For the most part their strategy had been avoidance.It was time for the final lesson.Once one had full mastery over earth energy, there were four parts to learning how to summon and control an actual golem. The first part involved harmonizing one's own energy with the energy of the earth around them. The second part involved melding one's concentration with the will of the earth, which would in turn allow for the detection of suitable rock or soil. And the third part involved releasing a burst of energy into the soil, causing the golem to appear. Controlling the titan entailed constant harmonization of one's thoughts with the earth's, and so was an exercise in itself. As a beginner, Zagarus would likely only be able to summon a small golem, perhaps only a foot taller than himself, but still quite bulky and strong. And the strongest stone he could command would probably be quartz. Truthfully, it would probably take years of training before he could summon a powerful titan like the one Sangilak had summoned before. But a beginning was a beginning.After a few more days of this, Sangilak would eventually have to depart. But she would give him a written guide for if he ever needed some basic reminders. \"Remember, the most important thing is respect for the earth. That and stubborness.\" She'd say with a smile.***They would meet at the entrance of one of the villages, at dawn. The people were already tending to their steep farms and their animals. Nearby a group of children and a few elderly people were preparing a light trek into the forests a little ways south so they could practice identifying edible wild plants. Some earth mages, archers, and falconers were out on patrol, searching for any more unexpected threats.The weather was clear and dry.\"So...\" She said, parting her hair. \"Where will you go next?\" It was apparent she had taken a slight liking to the man, despite his origin. \"You know you're welcome any time, as long as you're still just as friendly of course.\" Snowball the Yak would gently and playfully butt into his side.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "At first Sangilak couldn't believe what she was hearing.

You bringing me here to stumble and try to cover for my words is exactly what someone with a \u2018vengeful streak\u2019 would do. The power dynamic in this carriage is astoundingly heaped in your favor. I\u2019m sure that fact isn\u2019t lost on you, Empress.\u201d\u201cHaldar and Taingaard are unknowns. They appear militaristic and, to me, seemed to prize dull wit, rich food, and strength over much else. Of course I would talk about your might in that context.\u201dIulia pauses a half second, trying to emulate Naoki\u2019s own ploy of interruption. It does not work.\u201cWhat you have done for Isra, politically, economically, militarily, personally, all of that gets us to where we are as a country today. But it isn\u2019t a clean happy story. I can\u2019t paint a picture of some idyllic divine empress come from the heavens, because that isn\u2019t true. That story wouldn't be useful. I could cite specific examples of your vengeance, if you\u2019d like. Goaria comes to mind.\u201d The diplomat, now certain that she will have to give up that title, removes her glasses and cleans them with a small square of fabric. Her hands pass over the lenses as her eyes pass over the Empress\u2019s face.\u201cWhat I said is fact. That alone doesn\u2019t make it good or bad. I hope it doesn\u2019t need to be said, but I respect you, Naoki. You have made incredibly difficult decisions almost totally on your own. How others see you obviously doesn\u2019t trouble you much, when it comes down to it. You are self assured and confident. What I said matters little. Your own duel of wits with Konrad is what the world will focus on, not what some two bit ambassador had to say.\u201d", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Iulia starts to speak, getting a few syllables out before Naoki throws another question at the diplomat.
