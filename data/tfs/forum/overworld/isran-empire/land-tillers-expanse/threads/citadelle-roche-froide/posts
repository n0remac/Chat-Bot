This fort was built with permission following successful diplomatic\u00a0negotiations. This base coupled with the one on Camila Island has increased the range of the Gauldish Royal Air Force. Their air ships can now range across the mainland, increasing Gauldin's ability to trade. The teleportation circle allows for fast travel from The Expanse to Camila Island or to Nireal in Gauldin proper.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://40.media.tumblr.com/b78e02fac336b3a87177b4d8b10b0dc7/tumblr_nakm243zJj1qhttpto4_1280.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://40.media.tumblr.com/b78e02fac336b3a87177b4d8b10b0dc7/tumblr_nakm243zJj1qhttpto4_1280.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}}
