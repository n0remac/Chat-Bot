Its perch affords it not only an excellent vantage on The Expanse and The Empire in general, but more importantly, it is also the single best location in The Empire from which to obtain an unobstructed view of the night sky. Its telescope is among the finest extant, utilizing precision lenses forged at The Dawnfire Forges, trucked across the Plains, through the Eastern Forest, and all the way up into the mountains at great expense. For The Empress has professed an interest in the astronomical arts, stating that \u201cafter looking within oneself, one must then look beyond.\u201dWhat that means or just what exactly she does up there for hours on end is a mystery to all but the small team of resident astronomers and guards, who are bound by oath to secrecy. Her Observatorium is accessible only via portal, but the location of the other end of the portal is a secret as well.
