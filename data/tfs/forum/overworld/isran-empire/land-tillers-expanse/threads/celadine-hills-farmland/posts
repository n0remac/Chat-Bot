Once chaotic and war-like, things have settled down and the land is now peacefully inhabited by the local tribe and its neighbors.Raynor of the Celadine is the leader of this clan and one of the more prominent members of the tribe. He lives in a communal stone tower in the middle of the hills, along with other clan members.Among the clans, the Celandine possess an above average veneration of the tribe's history. If you wanna know about the tribe, the people here are the ones to ask.\"One could say that the people of the Expanse as a whole have returned to their roots. Historically these people have always been farmers and tenders of life, tied to the land and its magic. Thanks to the efforts of Lynx and her band of heroes, most of the evil and chaos which violated the civilizations of the Expanse has been quelled, and so equilibrium and serenity have taken their natural foothold. Although there is some technology here, most people in the Expanse live simple farming lives. There are even some prosperous nomadic and hunter-gather clans in the area. The Celadine is at the center of these clans and has diplomatic ties with all of them.\"The Celadine Hills are dotted by large stone towers. These towers are sort of like apartment buildings, able to house many families, and are intricately constructed with earth magic.A complex combination of herbalism, geology, and magic (along with some technology) allows for many sustainable communities to live in these hills.Different families have their own styles of \"intercropping\", combining different crops together for mutual benefit. Some use basic set-ups such as tomatoes, garlic, and certain types of flowers to repel pests while keeping the soil stable. Others use elemental magic to create environments where coconuts, bananas, pineapple, ginger, and medicinal plants can all occupy the same plot of land!The current record for most different kinds of crops grown in the same plot land is 12, by Raynor himself. Mostly they are millet, grains, legumes, and peas.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://pre11.deviantart.net/35eb/th/pre/f/2016/086/d/3/iaotia_spires_tower_over_farmlands_by_stephengarrett1019-d7zkl53.png"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://pre11.deviantart.net/35eb/th/pre/f/2016/086/d/3/iaotia_spires_tower_over_farmlands_by_stephengarrett1019-d7zkl53.png\" style=\"max-width:70%;\"/><br/></div>"}, "post-1760": {"user": null, "user_num": null, "timestamp": "1430355608000", "message": "Her eyes would flutter...

The elders of the other clans were discussing the signs of danger that the oracles had spotted. It wasn't that hard to understand. Their various magical instruments had detected anomalous readings from the dragons' graveyard, which suggested some sort of resonance between the skulls. Such a thing would normally be impossible, since bones, even dragon bones, were as dead as dirt, and the only thing that could result in such resonance would be a living dragon, the presence of which could mean serious problems for the Land-Tiller Expanse down the line.During the Cataclysm to the West, a group of dragons had entered their territory, hoping to conquer it. They mentioned something about a great exodus to a place called Darastrix, and that their group was unwilling to go. At first the Land-Tiller Tribe was sympathetic. They had nothing to do with the great dragon hunt, and if anything had eliminated most of the dark forces which posed a threat to dragons in their region. However, the dragons realized that the humans would ultimately side with their own species should people of the West pursue them, and decided it would be more prudent to take the land for themselves. Negotiations with them had deteriorated rapidly, and the creatures attacked their homes and farms. The Land-Tiller Tribe was forced to retaliate.And oh boy did they retaliate. Lynx of the Celadine was a middle-aged mother of the child Raynor, and her mastery of Chaos Magic had grown considerably since her own personal journey began. It was at this sensitive stage of her life that she had been called to duty.Raynor could still recall the blasts in the air, the incredible maelstroms and surges of energy which dotted the sky. Lynx herself led the charge, and had single-handedly felled dozens of dragons. However, she had also taken a direct hit from a lightning dragon and was critically injured. After recovering she vowed to avoid as many battles as possible so that her son would grow up with a mother.Those dragons that survived their encounter with Lynx cursed her name and swore vengeance on her and her descendants...Unfortunately, the anomalous readings came after his daughter Jun had gone on her own journey. He would have gone after her himself, but Ying-Na volunteered instead. After all, Raynor had many responsibilities here. Still, he wasn't too concerned. He knew Jun took after both him and her grandmother, and that she would become a powerful mage, even if deep down inside he wished she would follow a different path. Raynor didn't want to lose his daughter the way he almost lost his mother.But enough back story and rumination. Raynor shook his head and focused on the task at hand... teaching his incompetent neighbors how to grow muskmelons. They all lived in the same communal stone tower, and each had their own corresponding plot of land. Of course Raynor's family plot was immaculate and currently hosted a strong variety of herbs, peppers, and fruits. His neighbor's plot... not so much.\"You know... I keep telling you people you'd be much better off in the textile industry. You're good with your hands. I don't know why you insist on-\"\"Oh come now. Everyone knows there's no money in textiles! Clothes are so easy to make now since stupid Songbird Clan magically enchants their clothes. We need cash crops! Cash crops to sell! Now come help us out!\" The shrill little woman and her even greedier husband were waiting at the edge of the field. The poor bastards didn't even have the right tools. \"You guys didn't even remember to put a base underneath the fruit! The vines will rot and you'll have to keep requesting an earth mage to heal them.\" This time it was the husband's turn to be annoying. \"Why do you think we called you?!\" Raynor was losing his patience. \"I can't be in seven places at once!\"It was during their bickering that they noticed a strange woman with a marked face wandering around the field. Raynor turned to his charges. \"Oi, go get the bases ready. I'll see if she's alright.\" Despite the attitude of the couple, they obeyed without question. Raynor approached the strange woman, ready to cast a light spell in case she needed assistance... or perhaps turned out to be a threat. \"Excuse me, miss, are you alright?\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Most likely she wound up on a communal homestead tower, as it was the most common sort of community to be found in the Expanse."}, "post-1793": {"user": "Vorn Kazatul", "user_num": 101, "timestamp": "1430580395000", "message": "Yawned loudly, Vorn's eyes slowly opening to gaze upon their new enviroment.

How should I interact with them? Hmm...\"Intaja II watched from the treeline close by. She was excited to meet strangers despite the inherent secretiveness of her clan. But then again her elders did suggest she start developing her mirror self further. The mirror self is the key to growth, and Intaja II was anxious to reach her full potential. Although it was tempting to simply spend time with her brother, who in many ways was her mirror self, she needed experience out there in the world. She needed more chaos and to leave her comfort zone.\"Hmm, should I be brave? Should I be shy? Should I even act at all? What am I really feeling? My heart... it is... heh, rather neutral. Then I am free to do as I wish. I will try bravery. I haven't tried bravery in a while.\" She pulled out her little papyrus journal and looked at it.

Hers were especially neat and clearly formed compared to others in her clan, something she took pride in.With a rustle, Intaja arose from her crouch and began to approach the two strangers at the camp. She wished for a moment that Raynor was closer, as they were good friends, but she thought it was better this way. Fear added a new element to the equation, turning an old experience into a fresher, newer one. A part of her even hoped the strangers were dangerous. After all, one was a half-orc and the other was a... something...Intaja suddenly felt a surge of excitement and, instead of quietly approaching and announcing her appearance, returned to a lower posture and darted towards the two instead. She was astonishingly fast despite the fact that she was still rather crouched and low to the ground, making her seem like a predatory cat, and she was moving through long grass, making her approach hard to read. But before she reached the two she realized perhaps this would alarm them, so a few meters before crashing into the fire, she suddenly stopped and stood up, almost perfected straight, with her journal clutched close to her heart with one hand and with another hand waving amicably at the two. Her bare little feet pushed up slightly off the ground and her smile brightened.\"Hi friends.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "After a few minutes, Raynor would leave to bring food and water for his guests, who seemed rather bored and exhausted. \"Yes, they seem weary indeed.

In retrospect I think you were right all along, about the person I was meant to be, the person that I really was deep down inside, but at the same time it was just one of those things I had to figure out for myself, y'know?I'm so... so.. sorry I didn't listen to you, about what kind of person I was meant to be. You always saw the overwhelming good in me. I think in a way what you saw was yourself in me. And, I guess it must have hurt when I suppressed those parts of me in favor of... well, less savory parts. The truth is I was insecure. I felt weak. And I felt like I needed to get in touch with my darker half in order to be stronger, so I could experience what she felt. Actually, I did get the insight I wanted in the end, but I ultimately decided to follow my own path.Sometimes I felt like I understood her better than you, but for heaven's sake, she was your mother! I should have known you were wise enough to give me good advice about the person I should become. You'll be happy to know I met a powerful holy dragon, yes that's right, a holy dragon, named\u00a0Lum'Valia  . She's been tutoring me in becoming a holy mage. And if I do say so myself, I'm getting really good at it. I had to give up my demon magic and blood magic to start learning the virtues. I've got two already! Did grandma ever learn any?! Or did being a chaos mage make it impossible for her?Mom would be disappointed to find out that I never, ever took up archery. So I won't be shooting rocks out of the sky. And even though our tribe believes in opportunities for both men and women, I just could never see myself with a war hammer. My tomboyism has its limits. Maybe it's just because I don't wanna be TOTALLY like you, even though I am. I just see the warhammer as a father's weapon I guess. It's silly I know. By the way, tell mom I love her and I miss her, since she'll probably be off hunting when you get this.Actually, MOM, yah I know you're reading this now. At least I hope you are. I've heard rumors there are Acacia archers protecting Isra's borders, so you might be with them. Anyways, I DID find myself some cool melee weapons, and I'm gonna try to get in shape so I can use them properly. So there! I'm not a total book worm. Happy?!I love you mom.That reminds me, I've heard recently that the Phoenix State formerly turned our land into a Protectorate. I've met [Phoenix] Zaltos Kiraxo   personally and I even trained with him for a bit. He's very powerful, and a good man overall, but he can be kind of a jerk sometimes. From what I understand, he's treating our people well. But I don't know much about them beyond what he's told me. If the Land-Tiller's Expanse ever comes under attack, I promise I'll make it there as fast as possible. I know you guys are tougher than people give you credit for. Most over world people either haven't heard of us or think we're weak farmers. They'll be in for a surprise for sure.OH! My friend\u00a0Doobie du Shoobie   says hi. He's a magic-wielding kobold. He's pretty awesome. I'm a little worried he's gonna try to take over the world someday, but I can think of worse overlords.I've been through so much in the last couple of years. It'd take a whole journal to tell you everything. But just know, I'm ok. I'm much more powerful now then I was when I first left.Anyways, that's all for now. Take care of yourself.-JunPS: Tell Ma'Sum, I... I don't blame him if he finds someone else to be happy with. You might as well know, he threatened to break up with me if I left...

Not necessarily for protection, per-say- Naoki has no intention of disrespecting the security of Raynor's village. However, the Marshals are people too, and components of her party still. Their horses sent ahead to the stable, there isn't much else for them to do besides accompany Naoki to the village, and that seems to be their plan. Still, however, they are on duty, and this funny-looking chap is rather funny-looking, they think. For the time being, however, all they do is stand there silently, taking no significant action. The other six Marshals, along with the carriage, have since disappeared from view.  <br/><br/>Regardless, Naoki thinks it best to wait to be greeted, as not to be presumptuous or interrupt Jun's conversation. Instead, she takes this moment to glance over toward the nearest of the stone towers, casually examining the structure of it and doing her very best to avoid seeming as if she's eavesdropping on the conversation proceeding before her. </br>"}, "post-45918": {"user": "Kate Green", "user_num": 567, "timestamp": "1470601903000", "message": "\"That\u2019s Heeeer?\" Kate squaled. \u201cButhowisshe so tiny..?\u201d She referred to the space between her thumb and index finger, in disbelief.

There was minimal smoke, but it was quite warm. Several villagers were already at work. The air was permeated with the smell of herbs and the sound of knives tirelessly beating stone. There were enchanted cooking implements of various types scattered about, gifts from Belrow and Isra. Jun sat the large sack down and hoped over to a particular cupboard where she kept one of her prize possessions, a special knife given to her by Rowena Fletcher.\"I'm gonna help make a veggie stew with lots of herbs and spices. You can watch, or you can help out! Same goes for you Lady Naoki, if it's not beneath you.\" She winked.By virture of her feline nature, what might attract Madam Naoki even more was the smell of fish.

If she decided to explore the rest of the kitchen she'd find freshwater shellfish, prawns, large silvery fish, sea weed, oysters, etc etc.***As for Raynor, he would be busy directing the other villagers while also making last minute attendances to his farm.

It\u2019s interesting to see what all they have going on in here, what with the glyphs and such.

The room itself- the cookery, isn\u2019t the most terrible thing, and she finds its inherent warmness to be quite nice.However, the scent of fish is everywhere. Fresh fish, at that; the worst sort. Contrary to what one might assume, Naoki is in the \u201cDefinitely not a fan\u201d category when it comes to seafood. She finds the scent of it- especially in such quantity and a more or less unventilated room, to be quite frankly, rather nauseating. Unhinging her jaw slightly and parting her lips, Naoki employs a technique she learned long ago, and hasn\u2019t needed to in years. By breathing primarily through the mouth, pungent scents aren\u2019t quite as terrible, presumably because of the decreased airflow through the nose. This helps, but is only capable of so much when the air itself is seems to be suffused with scaly fish innards. As such, Naoki is less than fully aware of what all is going on, and only snaps back when Kate nudges her.\u201cSome leak?\u201d More or less blindsided by the request, Naoki takes a moment to reevaluate, reinterpret, and reassess the situation to figure out just what the heck all is going on. Only a moment, though. Without anything in particular to do or any real reason to deny Kate\u2019s suggestion, Naoki nods, accepting the great responsibility. \u201cOf course, the leeks.\u201dShuffling over to the indicated bag of leeks, Naoki decides to devote her attention wholeheartedly to ensuring that these leeks get chopped well, and that she doesn\u2019t regurgitate upon them during the process. That\u2019s a fine enough goal, she thinks.Quietly, she notes that this is an awful lot of leeks. A whole bag full, maybe thirty pounds worth. Some part of her mind registers that this is probably way too many leeks to reasonably fit in a stew. As such, she begins by selecting a few of the best looking leeks- those with the largest and clearest pale bits. Then, another handful, and another, until she has about ten.  Arms full of leeks, Naoki carefully proceeds over to what would seem like an area designed for washing and cutting things. What with a basin of clean water and knives and whatnot. Depositing her load onto the counter, Naoki begins by washing her hands; rinsing them in the water and drying them halfway with a nearby cloth probably intended for such a purpose. Next into the basin are the leeks, albeit one at a time. Dunking the vegetable in the water, Naoki uses her thumbs, primarily, to remove the dirt on the exterior and between the leaves. What a strange sort of plant, she muses, doing her very best not to pay attention to the fellow to her left, who would seem to be gutting some manner of fish. If she recalls correctly, it\u2019s in the same family of plant as onions, and garlic. What with the layers and the growing underground and such. Wish the first leek washed, she begins to form a second pile, for the clean leeks. Slowly and carefully, leeks move from one pile to the next, until the entire stack of leeks is about as clean as they\u2019re going to be without opening them.Next, Naoki supposes that she ought to chop them, as suggested. Leaning a bit close to the fellow gutting the fish, Naoki selects a knife more or less at random. (Why is he even handling raw fish in the same vicinity as the vegetables. Is she in the wrong spot? This is probably the fish area. Why hasn\u2019t anyone corrected her?)Focusing very intently, Naoki begins to take the knife to the leeks, starting by cutting the roots off each one and discarding the roots into what would seem to be a composting bin. Next, she makes an incision into each leek lengthwise, opening them up. With each step, Naoki processes her pile of leeks in tandem, performing each step to every leek before proceeding. Next, she washes the dirt out of the open leeks. What with being layered and growing in the earth, dirt tends to get all up in there, and she gets that right out. The open, clean leeks are then sliced thinly widthwise, and the little leek-bits are then slid from the cutting surface into a bowl. This leaves Naoki with only a bowl of perhaps two quarts worth of sliced leek bits in a bowl. Nodding slightly to herself, Naoki realizes that the fish-fellow has since finished his task and departed. Without any particular idea of what to do next, Naoki turns back about and moves to seek out Jun- who she hopes is responsible for the actual assembly of the stew, holding her bowl of leeks in two hands.

Hmm, oh, wanna see something cool?\"Jun raised one of her hands into the air. She whispered, \"You can come out.\" A glittering flash burst from her hands, and when it subsided she was gripping a bright, metallic blue longsword. \"Meet Resonance.\" A few of the nearby clan members pointed with a few oohs and aahs. Jun didn't like to show off her equipment or combat prowess when she was at home, so even they didn't get to see Resonance very often. \"Neat huh. The craziest thing is that it's alive. You can't see it but it's actually... well it's kinda hard to explain. It's sort of a... a sentient construct. It was created by Professor Echoes in Gauldin. Its consciousness is modeled after that of his young son who had been lost in the fabric of time and space. I'm a bit fuzzy on the details but somehow his consciousness managed to reach out to him, and with my help and the help of this thing's older brother, we managed to revive him.

When it's not in its sword form I can actually see it floating around me as a small fairy. Neat huh?\" She waved the sword around carefully. It was highly reflective, but it also seemed to give off its own faint light. The sword was extremely sharp, but it would not harm anyone without Jun's permission.Finally Jun noticed something odd about one of the gifts Naoki had received. \"Oh wow neat! Who gave you that?\" Jun pointed into Naoki's basket, singling out a chunk of ancient amber with a trilobite inside it.\"That's a rare form of currency among many of the clans. If you go into the Saskatoon mountains, you can find various fossils, including trilobites. No one really knows how they got there, but there's an old legend that tells of an evil god who once ruled over the Saskatoon mountains. They say that the animals rebelled against the tyranny of the god and traveled into the mountains to fight him. Most of the animals died trying to get there, but the lowly trilobite, a creature from the waters, somehow managed to crawl up there. Their fossils can be found at the highest points, which means these humble creatures were the ones who came closest to reaching the god. Of course no one knows if the story is true or not, let alone how a bunch of crustaceans managed to fight a mountain deity, but those fossils are symbols of bravery against insurmountable odds.

It was warm and comfortable. The stone hallway echoed with the chatter of a few late night villagers who decided that they could handle their farming responsibilities even while hungover. Their party walked right by a special room filled with medicinal plants. The door was partially closed, but a brief passing glance revealed several bags of herbs, a few rolls of bandages on wooden shelves, and a sweet, cinnamon-like scent. Finally they came to the end of the corridor, where a stone platform was waiting for them.Jun guided them to stand on the platform. She waved her hand over a glyph on the wall, and the platform began to rise up. They would pass by several floors with relatively dark corridors, all bathed with the same subtle red glow. There was an exception: One floor was filled with brightly glowing wisps floating over several indoor plants (Jun was visibly disappointed; she wanted to show this floor to Kate Green).Eventually they made it to a floor which could be surmised to be somewhere in the middle of the tower. It was completely dark and cold, save for an opening at the end of the corridor which allowed some moonlight in. Jun waved her hand over another glyph near the platform. This caused some slabs of stone to close over the opening, and a glowing light to fill the room. \"I'm really glad we made friends with Gauldin. When I was little we had to take the stairs.\" She then walked them down the hall to a new door, one of several. \"Yah, let's go with this one.\" The opening was a perfectly ordinary wooden door.Naoki and green would find themselves inside a quaint, primitive looking living room. There was a fireplace (which Jun promptly lit with but a wave of her hand), some simple looking wooden furnishings covered in cotton or feather-based cushions and decorative tapestries, and a wooden shelf with a bunch of scrolls piled neatly on each level. Along the walls were more tapestries, some charts with some cryptic information about plants and animals, and a few pleasant paintings of natural landscapes. There were openings to the outdoors shielded by wooden covers on the far wall. Jun walked over and opened them up, revealing a pristine, cloudless sky filled with stars.\"I grew up in a place just like this, except with more toys and what-not.\" She said, somewhat distracted by the stars.  A few seconds later she swiveled around and gestured to the side. \"There's a bedroom in there. You can sleep on straw mats, soft mattresses, or hammocks, depending on what you prefer. Oh and there's a personal washroom off to the side. There's a magic-based water system so you can bathe, although it's traditional to just use a warm bucket and clean rags since it saves water and is more efficient. But hey you're royalty so don't hold back on our account. It's also quite clean and there's no umm... smell.\" She then leaned in and said in a hushed tone, \"The, umm, waste, gets treated and then used in some of the fields.\"She then sighed with relief. \"Any questions?\" She flipped her hair back with a pleased-with-herself smile.(Presumably the Sun Marshalls would be similarly escorted by other villagers.)", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Jun blinked in surprised.

It was unusually warm despite the portal to the open night air. There were two stone elevations next to the wall. Jun stared at them for a bit quizzically and then raised her hands. The stone platforms slid across the floor with a deep scraping sound until they touched each other. Jun nodded with satisfaction before hopping to the side to grab some rolled up mattresses. \"I like to stack one on top of the other.

She then took a much softer, more luxurious mattress filled with feathers and cotton and dropped that on top. \"I do not recommend the hammocks. I tried that once. Didn't end well. Umm, oh you'll want these.\" She pulled out some hand-knit quilts and draped them onto the bed, along with some large pillows. \"Oh and uh, hang on.\" She rushed out of the room. Naoki and Kate would hear the sound of shuffling paper. It was apparent she was going through the pile of scrolls. \"Nope, not this one, not this one... oh where is it?

Er, I guess that's immaterial to your present situation.\" She rolled up the anatomical diagram and gleefully placed it on to the bed. Finally she snapped her fingers. A number of scented candles which Kate and Naoki might have missed when entering the bedroom suddenly lit up, casting flickering orange patches throughout the room.

As further evidence toward this, she is breathing heavily through her mouth, her tail has poofed up, and is lashing from side to side.Cutting Jun off before she can properly finish speaking, Naoki begins to shout, \u201cOh, I\u2019m SURE, I\u2019m suuuuure...!

Nearly spitting the words at this point, bitter sarcasm and contempt are nearly dripping from her words.\u201cWhat I really like, what really does it for me, what really turns me on, is when I\u2019m surprised with brute force, pushed face-down onto the bed, and seized from behind! The next thing you ought to do is bind my hands and feet, gag me, and then jam me full of your damn light constructs!\u201dThat seems to be about all Naoki has to offer for the moment, because she abruptly turns and stomps out into the living room without another word, leaving Jun and Kate there in the bedroom with her yelling ringing in their ears.If anyone might opt to follow Naoki out into the living room, they would find her sitting in the room\u2019s largest chair, feet up, knees bent. Her tail is wrapped about her feet, arms wrapped around her knees.

That's what she tells herself, at least. As such, Naoki does what she can to sequester those past tense thoughts away with all of the rest.

Her conclusion is that fear is awfully effective when it comes to overcoming grief, and she damn well better stay strong because the backup plans are awful.\u00a0The process takes only a few minutes and includes a particular set of stretches that Naoki last employed under very similar circumstances in the past.

I apologize that I came off as\u2026 as predatory, and seeking your submission. In hindsight, I ought to have abandoned my efforts after your first refusal. Or the second.

The sky is a brilliant azure, and puffy snow white clouds drift lazily by overhead. A gentle breeze sets the grass rustling and swaying, sending rippling waves of gold and green through the grasslands. A lovely day it is, all things considered. This day, a peculiar pair grace the hilly landscape. Atop the crest of one of the mounds, a large, muscular man with snow white hair and a strong jawline, the picture of a noble knight of old, lay sprawled beside a diminutive brunette, his left arm wrapped about her shoulders as he holds her close to him. Eyes of deep violet gaze lazily up at the sky, tracking the clouds with mild interest. Any denizen of the Land-Tiller's State knows that this is Jun of the Celadine, many-times saviour of the world and heroine to all, and her considerably less well-known boyfriend, Vaelar Black, former Medanese noble and de jure leader of the semi-famous mercenary company, The Order of the Hammer.Vaelar points up at the sky with his right hand, and the sleeve of his flowing white tunic slips down to reveal interlocking plates of mithril covering his skin from his elbow downward, attached to his flesh like a very intimate glove. Runes of Dwarven origin cover it almost completely, and with every motion of his arm or hand, a different sequence of runes glows blue for a moment before going dark once again. A strange contraption, to be sure.\"See that one there, love?\" he asks, indicating a strangely-shaped cumulus cloud in the sky. \"That one looks just like Blackbean.\"The cloud is vaguely bird-shaped, but the mind does most of the work in turning it into a crow in particular. Vaelar doesn't expect Jun to respond. Jun has been in a bad place for the last year or so, and he's willing to do anything he can to help her break out of her funk. Some might call what she's doing self-betterment, what with all the incessant training she's been submitting herself to since the accident. True, Vaelar trains for combat every day even if he no longer takes an active part in the management of his mercenary company, but Jun's constant drill to the neglect of all else in his mind can not be good for her overall health.He'd tried to reason this out with her in the beginning, but after the incident in which her failed attempt to cast a high-powered spell cost him his sword arm and caused her great pain, it had been hard to rationalise why it was bad to keep training to stop that from happening again. And so, Vaelar was helpless to do anything but watch as she ground herself down to exhaustion and starvation before collapsing into a restless sleep upon whatever surface she found herself. Finally, in the middle of one of her thirty-eight hour training sessions, Vaelar had stopped her mid-punch, taken her in his arms and told her that they ought to go somewhere nice to relax after she'd exerted herself so much. After a very lovely picnic -- for which Vaelar fixed a great number of delicious treats, including the first meal they'd ever eaten together, Sellsword Stew -- they had lain upon the hills to watch the clouds go by, and talked until they each nodded off into a nice afternoon nap.That was months ago, and the tradition has carried on ever since. Jun's pathological commitment to gaining power at the cost of her very self has certainly been winding down somewhat, but Vaelar's come to enjoy the daily outings, and, he hopes, so has she. He leans his head over to rest upon the crown of her own, sharing his warmth and his calm with her. He knows she's hurting, and badly, but he's always been better at causing misery than salving it. All he can do now is share her pain, and hope it helps her come back from whatever bad place she's found herself in.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<b><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a>[ A week before Jun's meeting with Doobie ]</b>"}, "post-95895": {"user": "Jun of the Celadine", "user_num": 108, "timestamp": "1582866228000", "message": "\"... Blackbean's put on a few pounds.\" Jun answered dryly.Despite her poor attitude, Jun reciprocated by pressing against Vaelar's forehead, embracing the therapeutic tugging of skin on skin. Her throat creaked audibly, a failed attempt at a sigh of relief. The colors of the world were muted. The verdant hills may as well have been drawn in with crayon. The sun violated her pores. The air did its duty by keeping her alive, perfumed by the false promises of the latest spring blooms. And the virgin blue skies were filled with the distant howls of faceless, hollow gods and unnaturally large beasts, singing with voices of war trumpets just over the horizon.The sight of Vaelar's enchanted arm pressed against her whole body like a cold block of concrete. The guilt of putting Vaelar into such a dangerous position, and the desperate need to just keep going, together pulled her apart, making sure she could go nowhere until she had been sufficiently drawn and quartered.What felt good, ironically, was when she raised her own arm to the sky, still wrapped in fresh bandages, still taut with esoteric gore. It reminded her that she had reverted back to being a moron, a self-reproach with the inverted effect of comforting her. When it came to trauma, often the rules were backward. Her badge of honor, her second-place trophy from her most recent Darwin Award competition, reminded her that life had already punished her and that, fuck, it was ok to go out on a picnic with your boyfriend once in a while.\"That one kinda looks like Boscoe.\" She lied.She let her hand fall on Vaelar's lap, her gambeson cushioning the drop. Lately, it felt like she couldn't go anywhere without it. It was warm. It was heavy. It was like a portable hug. It would shield her from an assassin's arrow or a bandit's fireball. Sometimes it felt like her only friend.\"I hate myself.\" She said out loud in an exasperated tone.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"...

Slowly but surely, it will be okay.Vaelar turns to wrap his other arm about her, the warmth of the mithril plating surprisingly close to that of his average body temperature as it presses into her back. He turns her toward him and wraps her up in his arms to hold her close to his chest, turning onto his back again so that she's laying upon him. His arms may not be as all-encompassing as her gambeson, but he's surely just as warm.\"You know, I think those may have been the best honey butter rolls I've ever made,\" he states mildly, referencing their earlier picnic in an attempt to get Jun to think of something other than beating herself up, \"and the Cremeschnitte was pretty good too.
