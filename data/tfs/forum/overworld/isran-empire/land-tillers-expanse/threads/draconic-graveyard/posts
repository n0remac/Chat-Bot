The dragons and people were originally willing to negotiate, but something went wrong, and things fell apart. Instead the\u00a0dragons tried to take the expanse for themselves. However, the magical guardians of the Land-Tiller Tribe were mighty and stood their ground, despite heavy losses on both sides. It was one of Lynx's final battles and a true demonstration of the might of the Celadine Clan.\u00a0The bodies of about a dozen dragons can be found here. The battle took place about 40 years ago.The area is mostly wetland surrounded by forest. For some reason there is no instance of environmental diffusion in this land despite the death of so many dragons. However, the trace amounts of magical energies surrounding the dragon skulls have begun resonating for some unknown reason.

Dragon bone was a very useful commodity to some. With the proper knowledge it could be used to make formidable weapons and armor. The large rib cages which jutted out of the ground would have signs of clean cutting, exposing dark, rotted, mummified marrow. Most of this harvesting was done by armorers of the Phoenix State, who could tread here with permission from Elder Havador.The mysterious resonating of the skulls will have died down recently. The great secret of the forest was that the energies which should have been released by the slaying of the dragons was actually stolen. A powerful necromancer had sought to revive his long lost love and use her as a puppet for world domination. However, through both luck and miracles of the mind, he had a change of heart. The once evil being had even gone so far as to sacrifice himself to save innocent people, at the behest of that great love.
