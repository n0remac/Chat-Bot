It is considered the lifeblood of the Expanse and is also where all the important facilities are. Because it is so vital, it is constantly patrolled by trained wyverns, the Chaos Falcon Corps, and various mages.At the Northern most edge of the river lies Elder's Valley, the location of the Expanse's seat of government. Just before reaching there, one must cross an outpost. This area is well guarded by water mages of the highest calibur, but the most powerful mage by far is Elder Havador himself, the leader of the Expanse. Legend has it he can split an ocean and then fold it onto itself.On the Southern end, there is another outpost just before reaching the Chaos Phoenix Temple. This outpost is protected by Grand Phoenixian Lai Ban, one of the liasons between\u00a0Phoenix Imperium and the Land-Tiller's State, and a member of the Dittany Clan. She wields an incredible amount of light and dark magic, and is said to be almost as powerful as Lynx of the Celadine was in her prime. Her powers are being augmented by a god-like entity called the Chaos Phoenix.", "link_list": ["/user/897"], "image_list": ["https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/33/4f/e8/334fe84dab7c0c8051c22e4019af3e5e.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/33/4f/e8/334fe84dab7c0c8051c22e4019af3e5e.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/></div>"}, "post-32914": {"user": "The Kingdom of Belrow", "user_num": 1359, "timestamp": "1460463809000", "message": "It was just now becoming light.

Still, they knew that attacking the temple was suicide.In other words, logic dictated that these creatures and their convoy were most likely friendly.As more and more escorts surrounded the convoy, the people would start to feel more at ease.
