As he watched the water, he was thinking of his response for a moment. What he would say was simple.\"My personal land... we go back to the near beginning of The Phoenix State, when it first rose. At one point in this world, when all creatures intermingled. Then darkness swept across the land, filling peoples hearts with pain and despair, tricking them into doing their bidding. The Chieftain at that time was Valheecius, one of the Six Horsemen. The other five of the Six Horsemen turned on Valheecius. When his body was killed and his soul sealed away, chaos broke out in what is known as the Gate of the Valheecius Desert. A giant red storm filled our skies the moment Valheecius passed, poisoning the air and assisting in the chaos. All the tribes began to go to war. We turned on our brothers. The evil that touched this land stained our desert red with blood. Tribes dissipated in the snap of a finger. For hundreds of years, this bloodshed continued. Then a few tribes in the land inside the ring of the Gate of the Valheecius Desert reached out to a few tribes within the Gate. Their hearts were pure and the desires grand and honest. After they turned their tribes around, creating prosperous lands, they went on a campaign. This campaign was blessed by the Six Faces and Amun Ra. These warriors and tribes made themselves known as The Phoenix State. It took many years to accomplish their goal, but they had cleansed the lands the best they could. All they asked for was loyalty to The Phoenix State. When we agreed, my tribe literally boomed within one week. Their military protected our tribe, outnumbering any tribe that would threaten us. They brought in an education system and modern health systems. They trained our warriors to their standard, investing into us so that we could defend ourselves. They literally rescued us from a pit that there was no end... Without them, it would have been a matter of days till my tribe would be slaughtered. So by committing our tribe to their efforts and accepting their help, we are now an independent tribe and have the large trade plaza in the Gate of the Valheecius Desert. My tribe is true to their roots, allowing only necessary advancements for their well being of their people. The Capitol Cities do the work, we just produce and supply them. With a population of about 1.7 million people, it takes a lot of goods to keep them going. Gold has a low value to them, as their is an abundance of it throughout our lands, which means they spend it frivolously. My tribe sells the gold to outsiders at a much much higher value, which was one reason why we pulled out of the pit so quickly. So far it's worked out. Our tribe is part of the State, we are healthy and safe, and one of the largest armed forces in the known Overworld. We have the ability to be free and do this for other lands, hence why we are here.\" During the bad times of his talking, his face saddened. During the good times he smiled. What his ancestors agreed to then is the only reason his stood now.\"As my tribe never really had many valuable minerals, we had clay pottery and the ability to sell anything we got our hands on, opening the ability to host large amounts of trade between outside lands.

It did not extend very far passed the Graveyard.\"Perhaps some explaining is in order. Some of your people have a history of hunting dragons, so you are probably aware that under some circumstances dead dragons give off powerful, deadly energies. I believe it is a phenomenon known as elemental diffusion. A lightning dragon's death can result in a prolonged thunder storm. A fire dragon's death can cause wildfires. However, this phenomenon did NOT take place at the Battle of New Darastrix, where the skeletons now lie. It's possible the energy was absorbed by someone or something.\"Havador further manipulated the water, which whirred and shook until the map was no longer visible. The water instead took the form of an elongating, shapeless pillar as Havador continued to speak. \"The resonating of the skulls could be related to whatever stole that energy, or it could be related to her...\" Finally, the water took on a humanoid form. The translucent statue, about 3 feet tall, showed an old woman. Her skin tone and colors were non-existent, but one could see she had straight hair and a thin frame, and wore a cloak. There were chains dangling from her arms. \"My old friend, Lynx. I'm sure her name gets dropped around a lot whenever you have dealings with our tribe, so you probably already know who she is. She died about ten years ago. She was responsible for slaying many of the dragons in that graveyard. Her powers were immense.\" Havador manipulated the waters again with his fingers, and the woman's skin began to smooth and her posture turned upright, showing her in her youth. \"Before that battle she had a reputation for slaying necromancers. It'd be a terrible irony if she were somehow resurrected, although I find that unlikely, still...\"Havador sighed.

Our agreement does not remain contingent on you solving the mystery however.\"Finally, the blobs finished forming into 3 distinct figures. that of a bearded middle aged man, a middle aged woman with a bow and arrow, and a young woman wielding chains very similar to that of the first. \"This is what's left of Lynx's family, her son, daughter in law, and granddaughter, all skilled combatants in their own way.

In the after life, you enter the heavens. Each god, deity, or whatever you call them, has it's own abilities. Much like our world, but reliant on our world. Our faith determines their power and existence. When we die, we go to the heaven or the hell of our belief. The older the god is and the more believers it has, the stronger it is. At a certain point, these beings are able to do post-conversions. This means those in the afterlife who still contain freewill are able to serve whom they please. The cursed blessing of the Phoenix is great. If this being you speak of could hear your prayers to seek the Phoenix, and we pray to the Phoenix to seek them out, maybe it could happen. Or another option is finding something of theirs that was worn or used by them that had contact with their skin. We then find a Phoenix Dove and let it burn to an ash with the bird. When the Phoenix Dove rises from the ash, so does the person. Again though, this is decided by a joint decision by the Phoenix and Amun Ra.We don't revive the dead. If it is to happen, it is a decision and work of the gods. It takes sincere devotion for either of these. I personally am not into religion, I like history and travelling. When I die, I want to remain in the heavens in eternal peace.You think about it and don't say anything to me. I don't like to bring up religion and magic like that in first conversations and I really don't want to discuss much more of it on my behalf because I do not want to say something that wasn't true because of my lack of knowledge on it.On to the non-aggression pact, that's fine. They're working somewhere around here, helping the people however they can, even if it's digging holes and shoveling animal manure from the stalls. We won't harm anyone unless our life is in danger, in which all means to restrain them will be taken.\"Pjui-Pjui would begin to move his hand out over the ground. It would shake for a second and wall of dirt would appear. It stood 6' by 6', but was only four inches thick. With it, a map would appear on it. With this being a spell of knowledge, this map was kept updated like a computer as it was a spell created by the TPS that allows the TPS to basically update the files for this magical map and keep precise location. On it was the various features with a vast desert land known as The Phoenix State and the Land Tiller's Tribe. Raised where mountains were, cracks for trenches, and various minerals in the ground to diversify the lands and features. It was very precise.Pjui-Pjui would point to a spot on the map, \"This is where I grew up. The safe space between a tar pit and a volcanic wasteland. Both of which are hidden now, their numbers dwindling. Their evil has plunged them into extinction. They are a prime example of what happens to tyrant tribes, they eventually turn on themselves. I think they're possessed to be honest, but the Druids say their possession is beyond their magic, as if they are in hell before their death.My tribe is very safe and successful now. The rest of this map is our lands and their locations. As you can see, you are on our eastern border, which is your west. South of the TPS is the Free Plains, which I did not know existed till now, so we both learned something new. I guess this is the location of where our ambassadors and representatives will meet. To the TPS north is Drumbar, Darkhive, and a frozen sea. The lines extending out are trade routes that extend into lands beyond what we see now.\"Moving his fingers in a typing like motion, the map would zoom out. It had many voids. It did reveal the Kingdom of Medan and Ivelius. Ivelius seemed to have a seal over it. This seal was used to mark enemy territory. \"What we see now is the main lands of the known Overworld. The land to the far south with the seal is what we stand against. They are the reason we stand for what we do.

Our people have many beliefs and we don't judge each other for them, but the most pervasive one is actually reincarnation, the belief that our souls die and are reborn, and continue to gain knowledge with each rebirth. There is a joke among our young people that those who commit evil acts are on a bad cycle. Our elder priests are often compassionate towards evil individuals for being young souls, ignorant and misguided, or perhaps even living this life to experience what it is to be evil. The joke is that a bad cycle is a double entendre from a woman experiencing a nasty menstrual cycle.\" His face turned grim. \"Necromancy is a controversial and forbidden art precisely for this reason, as it in a sense forces a soul away from their cycle, preventing them from being reborn or perhaps even killing who they were supposed to be in this life. In your case it would seem that necromancy infringes on the rights of a soul to enjoy its afterlife. I can only assume that this Phoenix Dove, a medium for Amun Ra, acts on the consent of the soul.

Along the walls and the pillars were small torches which emitted thin blue flames. They wouldn't feel particularly warm. Towards the back of the hall were crystal-looking statues depicting the legendary chaos mages, beings of terrifying power who were mostly (though not always) considered good. The most recent addition was Lynx of the Celadine, a woman wearing a cloak and chains running from her hands to her back. One might notice that the crystal depictions of the older chaos mages were far fantastical and exaggerated than the more recent ones. Lynx was depicted as a rather ordinary looking woman. On each pedestal beneath the statues was a brief description of each mage. Lynx's had a small paragraph titled \"Slayer of Necromancers and Dragons\".Once they got passed the main hall, they'd reach an alcove with a stone door in the middle.

(The Land-Tillers were insistent on not causing too much harm to their forests, and they had already traded some lumber to Belrow). They offered to trade copious amounts of bamboo, but only certain ship components could be made with bamboo and it was generally considered unsuitable for construction.They also agreed to help upgrade Gauldin's own agricultural output. They suggested companion plants for grape vines (such as blackberries to attract hunters of pests, and beans, peas, and barley to help feed the soil with additional profit) and spells which could measure soil content and health. But most significantly, they shared with them the designs for underwater capsule farming and the creation of artificial ecosystems in the ocean. These could be used to great effect in times of famine and drought to help sustain Gauldin's population, and reduce their need for fishing. Credit would mostly go to Huata of the Dittany  and Va'nei Dha'zhi, Earthwarden 's Guardians of Gaia.Gauldin also got to open up an air ship base in Land-Tiller territory, which would expand Gauldin's military influence and also help them defend the Land-Tillers in battle.In exchange, Gauldin would trade them certain luxury goods such as jewelry, textiles, and wine (the Land-Tiller's climate wasn't well suited for grape plants, so Gauldish wine was vastly superior in quality). Most importantly, they offered knowledge in rune crafting. Although the Expanse was well versed in elemental magic and basic runic writing and glyphs, their ability to set up large, complex runic systems was rather lackluster. In fact, the Land-Tillers were one of the few nations that didn't know how to produce anti-magic fields at all, until now. With the help of the Gauldish mages, the Land-Tillers would now have access to anti-magic fields and more complex runic systems. This ironically would also enhance the Land-Tiller's farming abilities and defenses against attacks. They would also use runes to enhance their enchanting abilities.Finally, both the Land-Tillers and Gauldin agreed to a non-aggression pact which included a provision for mutual defense.Gauldin, Isra, and the Land-Tiller's Expanse would now be friends.Once Havador and the other elders had a chance to look over the treaty, they signed.Now it was up to King Renaux...", "link_list": ["/user/1532", "/user/1056"], "image_list": [], "html": "<Fade out of grey>"}, "post-39727": {"user": "King Renaux of Trav\u00e9re", "user_num": 889, "timestamp": "1464651273000", "message": "The discussion between Havador, The Elders, Arianne, and himself did not take as long as Renaux had feared.

She was surrounded by friendly jeers and laughter. Havador grinned and patted her on the back before once again turning to the Chancellor. \"As one of our new brothers, I hope you will join us, Ryden of Isra.\" He said, hoping Greyiron would pick up on the subtle significance and humor of having been referred to in such a manner.

The local fish had evolved ways of staving off many of the local predators, interlocked in a precarious arms race against fishing eagles and small wyverns.

When the large raven swoops down next to the winged feline and thumps down onto the ground next to it, the manticore seems to nearly jump out of its own skin, startled, and wheels its way toward the crow, brandishing its scorpion-like tail. After a moment, though, it seems to recognise the crow from earlier, and bats the spiny fish over to Blackbean, hoping the beady-eyed corvid can find some way through the prickly scales -- preferably one that didn't involve a mouthful of painful venom.Vaelar examines the interaction with interest, before turning back to Jun and resting his cheek upon her head.\"Well,\" he begins, gathering his thoughts, \"as you know, I was taken by a sea dragon just after our last meeting, on my way back to camp. I assume the blasted thing wanted to eat me, but I had been knocked unconscious by the force and speed of its flight. When I woke up, I found myself in a dank grotto, surrounded on all sides by the shattered bones of those creatures -- and even some humanoids -- who I assume were unlucky enough to be unable to escape from this lair before the vile reptile found itself hungering again. The dragon lay nearby, asleep, but dressed as I was in my plate armour I couldn't make a completely silent escape. The dragon, however, had not counted on my trusty enchanted blade or my tremendous physical prowess, however, and before the thing could even hear my stomping footsteps, I severed its head from its body! I kept the horns and a cut of its scaled flesh, but that's beside the point.\"I found the opening where the sea dragon came and went -- an underwater passageway that ran all the way to the sea. I nearly drowned, but I escaped. I found myself, then, on a previously undiscovered island. It was a prehistoric place, untouched by civilisation, full of creatures that haven't been seen in the mainland since at least the cataclysm! Megaflora abound, and monsters that could tear a man in half with a single chomp! You'd be gone, just like that!\" Vaelar snaps his fingers for emphasis, pausing for effect before continuing.\"So I figured I needed to set up camp somewhere secluded while I planned my next move. And so, I did, in a nice little cave not too far off the beach. I would very quickly learn that this cave was the lair of a very large, very ornery manticore. While I was roasting a two foot long tuber I had found scrounging about the nearby area, he swooped in with a fresh kill in his mouth; some sort of very large cervid creature, looked like an elk or a weird moose.\" Vaelar's voice softens, \"Our eyes met, and I think he was as shocked that I was there as I was shocked that I was starting down a manticore. That moment felt like hours, but he finally dropped the corpse and charged at me, tail raised and claws swiping. Luckily, I had been using my blade as a spit for the odd potato, and so I was able to defend myself before being rent to shreds. It was a long and bloody battle -- we both took some nasty cuts, but I came out on top. The guy lay there, beaten and bloodied, and I collapsed onto his furred figure. His breathing was laboured and his blood ran like wine in a cheap tavern, and I knew he would not be long for this world were I to let him die. But I looked into his eyes and something told me that I shouldn't let that happen. Maybe it was the delirium of hunger pains, but in my gut I knew that I needed to help this creature.\"\"I went about bandaging my own wounds, and then I worked up a healing tincture using what little I know about herbalism and patched him up. I butchered and roasted his kill and fed him by hand as he lay there. At first he wouldn't let me get close, batting at me whenever I attempted to close the distance, and so I had to toss the meat to him from afar. Even though he clearly didn't trust me, he gobbled the food up as if he were starving, never seemed to get full. I doubt he'd had cooked meat before, and I think he took a liking to it. Anyway, eventually he let me get close enough to eat out of my hand, and from then on we began to bond. It was several weeks before he was well enough to go hunting on his own, an even longer after that until he let me mount him, but manticores are clever and have a long memory. I think I made a friend for life by saving him, and in return he saved me, flying me all the way back to the mainland. How he knew where it was is a mystery, and likely one that won't ever be solved. But here we are, and he hasn't left my side since,\" he concludes, smiling down at Jun.\"I don't think you ever told me how you met that crow of yours, either.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Vaelar chuckles at her statement."}, "post-86533": {"user": "Jun of the Celadine", "user_num": 108, "timestamp": "1541399704000", "message": "Blackbean caws playfully, a half-apology, half-chuckle for frightening the manticore.He cocks his head curiously at the fish, then starts poking at it.

He stabs it, then spreads his beak apart, splitting the skin right up to the mouth. He then starts eating the innards, bones and all.Meanwhile, Jun hangs on each of Vaelar's words. Her eyes have brightened, and she grins with pride. Vaelar\u00a0could go toe to toe with any fairy tale knight in shining armor.What impressed her most of all, however, was the act of mercy towards the manticore. It was both a kind thing to do, and very clever in the end. These were traits she valued in Vaelar, enough to overlook his often overly-affected chivalrous speech.When he had finished and was smiling down on her, she gave a single chuckle and looked down towards the manticore, who was apparently trying to befriend Blackbean with some kind of spiny fish offering (either that or toss him a scrap he didn't know how to deal with himself).\"You should take note. It's stories that mix valor and compassion that make a man that much more attractive.\" With that, she blushed slightly.\"Huh, I guess I never shared that with you, huh?\" She glanced up thoughtfully and leaned back. \"It feels like such a long time ago. It almost doesn't feel like me who did it.\"***She sighed. \"My grandmother didn't believe in withholding magical knowledge from me. She wanted me to learn all kinds of magic, so that I could decide for myself what I would keep and what I would discard. In retrospect, it was probably wrong of her. I was so ambitious and power-hungry that I dove headlong into all types, even... the less savory ones.\" She held up a clarifying finger at Vaelar. \"The one thing I would never, ever touch is necromancy. Our people hate necromancy. It's a long story. But my grandmother was a combat pragmatist. So she wasn't afraid to call upon the next best thing: blood magic. She could use her own blood to summon demons, and if necessary even enter the demon realm. She was able to sign contracts with certain demons, whose only price was the inflicting of suffering on her. It wasn't something she relished using, but she did so to great effect. Hmm, she could also use her blood as a sort of magical ignition source, like a mana potion and a weapon rolled into one. It's all very complicated and nasty, and a little off topic.\"She cleared her throat uncomfortably. \"The point is, I could do it too. And quite frankly I was good at it.\"After a pause, she continued. \"There were four demons in particular that I had befriended. One was a sort of skeletal horror with many faces named Dantalion. As far as evil goes... he wasn't actually that bad. He was understanding of the nature of good and evil, and of people in general. He knew me very well, and when I finally gave up demon magic, he was the first to tell me there were no hard feelings between us. The other three were demon crows. Blackbean was one, and there were two others, Cinnamon and Blueberry.\"She grinned, embarrassed. \"I must have been hungry when I named them... Anyways, demon crows are very intelligent. They're not particularly evil either. In fact, I'd call them more... morally neutral. They feed off of the scraps of other demons in hell. They consume blood, diseased flesh, all sorts of nasty things you find there. Sometimes they hunt. All they ask for from a summoner, mostly, is good quality food from the mortal realm. Dantalion was the one who helped me find them and make contracts with them. He's sort of a demonic mentor by the way. He archives people's stories and knowledge. He's an asshole to most people, but he respects the audacity of those who would dare practice blood magic. I kind of miss him sometimes, but he knows where we stand. The path I'm following now has no room for the kind of... self, that blood magic requires. It's a very visceral, burning, dark energy you have to have. And frankly, it's not very healthy.\"She sighed exasperatedly and looked up to Vaelar. \"Sorry, I keep getting off topic. This is all really personal, you understand. Lots of baggage in this tale. Anyways, specifically, I found them in a realm of hell called the Black Char Forest. It's a... very red place. The lighting, the black sun, the heat, the only trees that grow there are bare black trees. There are lots of nasty little critters there too. Huh, not the most creative name for a region now that I think about it. Anyways, the demon crows like to scavenge there. I don't remember which demon lord rules that place. I think it's more on the outskirts of hell. Anyways, the demon crows are relatively friendly, and are good starter demons if you ever get into that sort of thing... which I really really really don't recommend you do.\" Jun blinked repeatedly. \"Uh, but anyways, those three were part of a family. Blackbean's a pretty big guy, even for a demon crow. But he's sort of a gentle giant. The others are more vicious. They used to steal food from him. He was a good hunter though, so he didn't starve.\"Jun peered down again at Blackbean and Boscoe. She beamed. \"He has very little malice within him. For this reason, he's actually rather resistant to holy energy and light magic. Some demon crows are like that. If for some reason they're able to find a source of holy energy, they'll bathe in it to remove demon ticks. It's actually pretty funny. They'll flap around in it and these awful bugs will just start smoldering and smoking and fall to the ground. It feels like a hot bath to them.\"Sorry, I'm rambling again. Long story short, Dantalion set up the contract, I signed it in blood, and we were set. From then on I could just summon them from the demon realm. I figured out a way to cheat a little. I could withdraw blood with a syringe and place it into a vial, then use the vial to cast the spell. It's much more convenient than slashing a palm on the fly. Of course, I can't do it anymore. Oh! The reason why Blackbean is still here is because, after I became a holy mage, I met up with a demon friend of mine named Maelik. I told him I wanted to say good-bye to the demon friends I had before. He opened a portal to the demon realm and helped me get back in contact with the demons one last time. And let me tell you, every single one of them except for Dantalion and Blackbean, thought I was a bitch and a traitor. All my old contracts were destroyed, except for Blackbean's.\"Jun paused, hesitating, as this next part Vaelar might find disturbing. \"There is a small black stone, hidden somewhere, that contains a small portion of my soul. It's what binds Blackbean to the mortal realm. If it's destroyed, nothing will happen to me. But Blackbean will be forced to return to hell, and I'll never be able to see him again without the help of another demon lord. Maelik was an exceptionally kind demon. It was a miracle that I ran into him. I doubt I'd be able to meet another one who would help a holy mage reunite with a demon friend.\"She looked at Vaelar with earnest. \"Blackbean doesn't like hell. He prefers to stay here, with me. Honestly, he's the only vestige of my old self that I truly don't regret... So yah, that's the story.\"She took a deep breath. \"That felt good actually.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Blackbean caws playfully, a half-apology, half-chuckle for frightening the manticore."}, "post-86583": {"user": "Vaelar Black", "user_num": 609, "timestamp": "1541479648000", "message": "Vaelar listens attentively to Jun's story, his expression changing as she speaks, from mirth to concern to amusement and so on.

Not that it makes you any less attractive, mind, but it's not something I would ever guess you would even consider doing!\" he exclaims, a bit astounded by the twists and turns of the story.\"The only interactions I've had with demons have been at bladepoint, as I cut their foul hearts from their soulless chests. I hadn't even considered the possibility that they might have anything besides baser vile motivations for their dastardly acts, or that they would willingly make unforced pacts with humans, that they nearly unanimously consider inferior in my experience. One learns something new day by day, as the old saying goes.\"He smiles brightly at her afterward and presses his forehead to hers.\"I am glad you told me, too. I wish to share all your burdens with me, to allow me to shoulder your demons alongside you,\" he continues.Down below, Boscoe examines Blackbean's tougher beak with interest. Back home, his heightened intelligence in comparison with other beasts of the island had allowed him to use them in symbiotic relationships, and he observes the similar intellect in Blackbean's beady crow-like eyes. He returns to fishing, standing by the waterfront and looking back at the corvid expectantly. He aims carefully, and then strikes with his scorpion-like tail, impaling one of the spiny fish upon it without harm due to its chitinous exoskeleton. He flings it back toward Blackbean, who catches onto the idea quickly and begins to tear into the creature's tough, venomous flesh, filleting it and tossing it aside, before being thrown another. The less dangerous fish the manticore skins itself with its deadly precise claws, and tosses into the pile. Before long, they've got a huge pile of fish-meat stacked up next to them, and on some unspoken mutual agreement they decide that it's enough to fill them both up. In point of fact, it looks like a large enough pile to fill a dragon's belly for a full day. The two get to chomping down fish-flesh indiscriminately, each sharing about half the pile.Vaelar looks on this cooperation with lazy interest, but most of his attention is upon the lovely warmth that fills his arms, and their shared heat. He suddenly wraps her up in both of his arms and rolls her onto his chest, squeezing her in a tight embrace. It's a bit sudden, and almost unprovoked. Perhaps he hadn't yet processed his being reunited with her, but it's as if he's been filled with an abrupt and overwhelming euphoria. He looks down at her with a beaming, genuine grin and places another kiss to her lips, pressing his nose to hers afterward and gazing into her eyes, his own filled with a fiery, loving passion.\"As exciting as that island was, I cannot begin to describe how glad I am that you are back in my embrace, my little heroine,\" he intones.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Vaelar listens attentively to Jun's story, his expression changing as she speaks, from mirth to concern to amusement and so on.

Her eyes more so, they scaled the opposing cliffside as Jun contemplated vanquishing the beast on the horizon.A little bit of discomfort and fear prickled up her spine as she realized that Vaelar had no idea what he was talking about. She had a flashback to that fateful day. On one end was Daedalus, one of the most powerful mages she had ever met besides her own grandmother, capable of casting spells she could only dream of (for now). On the other end was herself, recently returned from an apprenticeship with what was essentially a nature god. Both of them used magic which quite literally shook the earth with their fury. They literally set the horizon on fire. And this deific trespasser or whatever it was, laughed at them.It was frustrating. It was painful. Jun had accepted that she didn't need to surpass her grandmother, that she was her own person with her soul, her own dreams, her own ambitions. But at the very least, she wanted to be able to protect her people from harm. But this stupid, godforsaken world just kept raising the fucking bar. How much stronger did she have to get? Was calling upon the power of an entire forest to drench the enemy in exploding ghost animals not good enough?But like Vaelar, she didn't let those insecurities register on her face. It was healthy and right to be honest about her feelings, but only in a trickle, enough for Vaelar to deal with. He had almost died himself, and he didn't deserve to be treated like a mop for her tears. The flood dam would have to be held back. Yes, only a trickle would get through.She gripped his shoulder and closed her eyes.\"Yah, we will.\" She said resolutely.As the topic shifted to the speed of their mounts, Jun's spirit sat straight up. \"Is that so?\" The mood completely shifted. Her teeth were bared devilishly. \"You think your overused castle motif can keep up with my best friend? Psh. Dragons are overrated.
