The plan very slowly spun upwards and outwards, and little buds were beginning to form on its stem in between its leaves.\"There are, what do you call them, records? Of our history in the... Guardian Wizard's Tower, but they only go back so far. I think a lot of books were destroyed during the necromancy wars. Bad people don't want good people to become smart. Everyone knows about Lynx the chaos mage and how she lead the... resistance! Against the necromancers, and how she fought the dragons that tried to invade from the East. But in our long history there were dozens of chaos mages. Some might have been more powerful than Lynx. Some might have been good and helpful, while others were evil and punished the Expanse for its supposed wickedness. But hardly anyone knows about them.\"By now the seedling had grown into a decent vine, and was starting to bear fruiting flowers.\"There's a legend, about how there was once an evil god somewhere in the Saskatoon mountains. They say that this was before humans. All the other animals that existed rose to fight the evil god, the birds of the sky, the creeping things, the bears, great mighty lizards, and even fish, who tried to swim up the stream into the mountains. There was one type of animal... a... trie-low-bite, a small crawling thing, like a cross between a crab and a centipede, that rose out of the water and slowly crawled towards the mountains. All the other animals told it to go back, that it would never make it, that it would be useless. The trilobites ignored them and kept climbing. Eventually the altitude got to everyone. The air was too thin for the birds, the rocks too steep for the bears, the fish ran out of streams, the lizards were too heavy and fat and got tired. But the trilobites kept climbing until they finally made it to the top. There they fought against the evil god alone, and somehow they won.\"The vine was ready. Several medium-sized orange fruits had sprung from the vines. Huata picked one and peeled it in half, removing a large pit. He popped the rest into his mouth and smiled. Then he pulled out a trilobite fossil inside a small glass sphere, considered a high form of currency in the expanse. \"That legend explains why there are these skeletons at the very top of the Saskatoon mountains. Of course, I don't know if it's true, but it's an nice story and a lot of people like it.\"Beaver gave a little shriek. It was proud of him for remembering the whole story.Huata snapped his fingers, having remembered something else. \"There is a rumor that a golden trilobite lives somewhere in the expanse, immortal and impossible to kill.

Well, my understanding is that druids use magic to commune with living things. My school of magic works something like this: All magic is based on the life force found in all things on the earth. When we cast spells, we communicate with this life force to get it to bend to our will. I used to think of the life force as a weapon, something to harmonize with to unleash its destructive power. But when I received training from Fundor, I learned that the magic itself is alive. He taught me to absorb heat energy from my surroundings to cast my spells, by trusting the energy from the heat to help me when I was out of mana. I learned that the communication of magic works both ways, if that makes sense.\"Jun thought for a moment. \"So, fundamentally, druid magic is people's way of 'talking' to living organisms, with our magic, and also unleashing the full potential of life.

It's like every element is a spirit that wants to be a part of life, fire, water, light, darkness, lightning, earth... This principle I feel is what allows me to wield druidic magic so quickly, but also makes it hard to focus it by itself.\"Jun decided to try again, just for fun. She tried to command a flower to grow out of nowhere. After a few seconds a brilliant red bloom blossomed out of the earth. Jun was stunned by its beauty, It had large waxy petals and golden highlights spread throughout the blossom like veins. She gave a satisfied chuckle... until the bloom suddenly began steaming and burst into flames. The once glorious plant withered into a little grey stalk and then disappeared.\"I'll seek out a magical nexus and come back later.\" Jun saluted.

But this time she was staring into those gigantic works of art that were a dragon's eyes,surrounded by trees, cool air, and fresh soil, with friends and family within walking distance. It was a much more pleasant experience.\"I guess you're referring to this?\"Jun gave a little curtsy, accentuating the leaves of her skirt. Despite the two weeks elapsed time her living druidic outfit held up much better. There was only a little yellowing at the edges of the leaves, where as last time the outfit was half dead after a single week.\"Yah, my druidic magic has gotten stronger. Look.\" Jun raised her hands up and wiggled her fingers playfully. Then she focused. Va'nei would notice a much more controlled, coordinated flow of druidic energy from both her finger tips and the ambient environment. It started small, very small, and a correspondingly small seed formed out of nowhere within the earth. Afterwards the magical flow increased exponentially, resulting in the seed growing.\"You see what I was doing wrong before? I was trying to do it all at once. It's easier to manipulate a small living organism into a large one, as opposed to creating a large one out of thin air, so I realized I was better off creating a small organism to work with. That way I can still make whatever I want.\" Indeed, as she spoke the little seedling rapidly expanded into a large, healthy, tree-trunk like vine.\"This next part is even cooler. Watch.\" As the vine continued to grow, Va'nei would notice odd, marble-like fruiting bodies growing out of offshoots along the vine. They came in various colors ranging from a deep mahogany, swirling red, to a translucent grey with white glowing spots within its flesh. \"You see, it's still hard for me to keep the other magical energies from infecting my creations, but with some concentration and practice, I can instruct the magic to coalesce in a way that doesn't hurt the plant. The vine is just fine, and the extra magic is kept safe in those fruiting bodies. Also, look!\"Jun waved her hands apart. The large vine stopping growing. She then raised one hand forward and thrust her palm up. The fruiting bodies popped off the vine and began to dance around Jun. Jun then turned to her side and face her palm towards the air. One of the dancing orbs, a red one, flew to her palm and then popped. A powerful, but concentrated burst of flame careened out of her palm and towards the ground. There was a flash, and a small crater was left behind. Jun then took her other palm and summoned a blue orb to it. Then that orb popped, releasing writhing ribbons of water which floated about until they struck the ground. \"One more thing.\" Jun closed her eyes and focused. She focused very, very hard. The greyish orb and a dark violet orb floated towards each of her palms. Va'nei would sense Jun straining quite a bit, almost alarmingly so.\"Twilight... dancers...\" The orbs pulsed and then burst. Jun now held a white flame and a black flame, one in each hand. The two flames seemed to struggle to grow larger, as if trying to form into something big and powerful. There was a swirling of mana around her and a wooshing, jet-engine like sound-And then it stopped. The flames unceremoniously went out, and Jun collapsed on her knees. Gasping she said, \"Ugh, nevermind.\" She looked disappointed. \"Still can't do it.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "It had been a while since Jun had seen the great dragon in her true form.
