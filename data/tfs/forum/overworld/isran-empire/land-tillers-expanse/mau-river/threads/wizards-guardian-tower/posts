Esejef waved his hand and the doors swung open.The first thing that would strike the trio, believe it or not, would be the voices of children. There were children of various ages and both genders, wearing different garments. Most of them were robes, and some were fairly ordinary civilian cloth. Some of them had tattoos on their faces. Some of them had pale skin and some dark skin. It would be quickly apparent that all the different clans were represented here. \"Master E!\" One of them cried. He was a young boy, about 8 years old. \"Who are they? They're weird.\" Esejef smiled. \"Now now...\"The trio would be surprised to hear that Esejef's voice was different than normal. It was much smoother and more elegant and mature. He would sound like someone different entirely. \"Remember your training. What do you feel coming from them?\" The young boy looked at them completely unafraid. \"Umm... one of them is a girl... one of them is a guy, they're not human... they're friendly. They don't want to hurt anyone... But two of them are afraid of each other... Ugh that's all I've got.\" Esejef nodded and in his strange, buttery voice replied, \"Very good. A plus. When you're older you'll be able to see more clearly.\" The boy nodded before returning to his friends in the lounge.Speaking of which, the first floor was essentially a lounge. There were many places to sit and all kinds of magical artifacts to keep the children entertained while also training them. There were also books, many many books, and scrolls, lines on shelves all over. Most of the furnishings had a stone base, but with lots of cloth, feathers, and other species of pillows and cushions. And most of all, there was a considerable magic presence everywhere.\"As you can see...\" Esejef sounded like his old self again. \"The first floors are a school for the most magically gifted. That young man wishes to join the Psionic Corps when he is older. His powers show great promise. With my powers our true identities are hidden. You look merely like humans, and I a somewhat younger teacher. Him and others like him are the only ones who can sense that you are not quite what I say you are. Also, feel free to peruse the shelves if you wish. They mostly contain basic elemental spells and techniques.

The tower was more than just a school after all.The next few floors were actually not that interesting. They were mostly living quarters and classrooms where more children, and adults, were practicing their spells and learning about magical plants. They could stay and examine these if they wished, but the further up they went, the more... interesting things would get.They would eventually reach a floor with a library of texts. There were only a few people walking about the large shelves. The books themselves had a more primitive feel to them, mostly papyrus and sheepskin, not fancy or bound. But the pages were clean and extremely easy to read. There were books on ecology, magic, weather phenomenon, animals, and a host of other things.. All were extremely well written. \"This is one of Elde Havador's favorite floors.

The pillars closer to them would reveal that it was specific books being highlighted. \"If there is an emergency, these must be the first to be saved from the tower.

He slowly closed the book and placed it back into its original place.\u00a0"}, "post-37048": {"user": "Esejef I of the Sodalite", "user_num": 1474, "timestamp": "1462819992000", "message": "Esejef smiled. \"I should hope so. Remember, with friendships comes possibilities. No one gets anything done alone. Such is the case with civilizations as well as individuals. Now, if you really want to see the heart of the Land-Tillers, follow me. This next floor is possibly the most important of all.\"Esejef would lead them another flight of stairs. When they got to the top, the party would notice a sudden shift in tone. All the previous floors had an approachable feel to them, but this floor was different. The walls were inscribed with many glowing runes. There was a presence here, something benevolent and powerful, a special kind of magic which was alive to the point of almost having a consciousness. Zar'Dura in particular be sensitive to the strange phenomenon.\"This room is frequented by the spirits of the ancestors. Any soul that spends any time as a land-tiller will visit here from time to time. You will see why soon.\"Esejef lead them through the short corridor and into a rotunda, bathed in blue light. There were strange blue flames softly dancing on torches scattered around the walls. They had no heat to them. \"Behold... the heart and soul of the Land-Tillers...\" The first thing the party would notice was the presence of floating crystal spheres, each the size of coconuts. They each had a slight color tint to them. \"Be careful, touching them can be somewhat... overwhelming.\" Should they attempt to do so, the sphere would glow, and the person's mind would start to flood with memories and visions of... families. Mothers, fathers, children, and how they grow up in each clan. The games they played, the jokes they told, the chores they did, the parties they held, the funerals they cried at, would all flood the person's mind. \"Each of these spheres contains the essence of a clan, and can act as a guide to future generations who wish to live in this wonderful land, should something terrible befall us.\"After touching the spheres, there would be a slight hum, like an alien chorus, followed by several small pillars of light leading towards the back of the rotunda. Once again, there were books being highlighted in the same tint as the spheres. \"In anticipation of a power drain, these spheres can uses significantly less magic to instead highlight various texts in which our culture can be found. It is very similar to the library from below, but these books specifically contain instructions on how to raise children in the manner of the clans, how to begin farms anew and maintain them, how to fight like the clan members, how to make tools and weapons. AH! Malagus! You will appreciate this next part.\"Esejef would raise his hand towards an alcove in between the sets of bookshelves against the wall, and the stone door at the center would raise up, revealing a hidden room. \"Come, come!\" As they entered the room, they would see it filled with little silver sparkles. The temperature would be very cold. The room curved around the rotunda to maximize floor space, and once again there were runes everywhere. There were large metallic containers on the floors, and glass cases (at least the material looked like glass). \"Each of these containers contains seeds. All the different types of plants, as well as instructions on how to plant them, can be found here. Ah, and Malagus?\" He gestured towards the glass shelves. Malagus might recognize some of the enchanting farming tools that he had traded to the Land-Tillers. \"One of each tool is being kept here, to aid those generations who may need it. Thank you for them by the way, they are being used to great effect out there in the fields.\"After a few moments of silence, Esejef would make one last remark. \"I believe this is the closest analogue our people have to your chamber of spirits, a life preserver to ensure our people always survive.\"He turned to the orc couple. \"It's different isn't it? Our lands. Isn't it beautiful, how many different kinds of things you see in the world? So many brains... so many stories...\" Again, the man waggled his fingers over his head at the world brains.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Esejef smiled. \"I should hope so.

(According to him he was busy thinking about where he should retire next century...).They would speed passed many floors now, occasionally stealing glimpses of some very odd floors indeed. There were mages holding strange seances, labs with glowing artifacts floating about, at least one floor dedicated to large reptilian beasts, etc. Of course these were balanced out by additional libraries, empty meeting halls, and full meeting halls full of wizards. There was at least one room that contained a brilliant glowing being whose body was completed obscured by a cloudy aura. (\"Don't mind him. His name is Lee.

The sky would break above them, and they would be on a a large flat roof surrounded by crenellations.Like the Council Hall in Elder's Valley, the top floor featured several crystal statues of some powerful looking beings. The ones with older dates looked more fantastical and mythical than the more recent ones, and the most recent was Lynx of the Celadine, Slayer of Dragons and Necromancers, who looked like a perfectly ordinary young woman. These statues were all facing out towards the horizon, as if they were guarding the expanse before them.Speaking of which, the view. If one looked to the north, they would see the beginnings of a mountainous region, dotted by tree life. Even further beyond that were snow-capped peaks, on the southern face representing the furthest one could find Saskatoon clan settlements. What lay on the other sides of those peaks was anyone's guess...To the west and east were large expanses of forests. To the West were the Celadine stone towers and the various fields their people employed. To the East were fewer forests and more fields, many more fields. If they were lucky they'd catch a view of a flock of wyverns heading north to nest after feeding in the forests.Finally to the south was the river that ran through Elder's Valley, the elder's Council Hall, the Badger Clan farms, and more fields, many more, interspersed with trees. The most prominent color through all of it would be green. Green green and more green.\"We may not be the strongest nation, or the most advanced, but I do believe we are by far the most alive nation in the overworld.
