There are people who follow this path who do not even consciously worship anyone. If you must worship a deity, worship one that deserves your devotion.\" - Grand Phoenician Lai Ban of the Dittany.Temple of the Chaos Phoenix: A bit of a misnomer, the Chaos Phoenix is so named because of its acknowledgement of both light and darkness, not for its devotion of chaos as opposed to law. Followers of the Chaos Phoenix focus on spiritual growth and morality as they come to terms with their imperfections and sins. The Chaos Phoenix celebrates those who have reformed themselves and their lives. The main tenants are wisdom and forgiveness. The Chaos Phoenix is the least violent and war-like of all the children of the Red Phoenix. Those who were once evil and now seek the path of good are most welcome here.The temple is located on a small inlet in the middle of a lake. The river that feeds the lake flows down from Elder's Valley. Worshipers and tourists would cross a stone bridge to reach the main temple.Here you'll find martial artists who practice disciplines based on evasion and misdirection of the body, as well as light and dark mages who hone their skills and learn about each other. There are also many religious texts and monks who are willing to give aid to those who seek it.The temple is protected by Grand Phoenecian Lai Ban of the Dittany, a local of the Land-Tiller's state who traveled the world in search of truth. She has the power to commune with the Chaos Phoenix, a benevolent entity and offspring of the Red Phoenix.Addendum. Ever since the Phoenix State disappeared, the chaos phoenix has felt free to \"rebrand\" itself as a more gentle, merciful creature. It was always like this, but now that its more wrathful father and the war-like kingdom to the north had disappeared, the phoenix felt free to do its own thing. Lai Ban remained the host of the phoenix. She began to write more religious texts, and the more... violent ones of the Phoenix State's past were gradually moved further and further into the backs shelves.Addendum 2. The Temple of the Phoenix of Mercy houses one of three hidden command centers which helps maintain the TERRA Defense Network. It is hidden underneath the temple in a dungeon.", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/2080/defense-network"], "image_list": ["http://miriadna.com/desctopwalls/images/max/The-palace.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HUYq2FuYxwM/VCjGf3xxdzI/AAAAAAABK-Y/yqDilfjogiY/s1600/contestmikoto__amaterasu_essence_of_the_sun_by_essenzadelsangue-d4xkdk5.png", "https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/1f/3d/d5/1f3dd533281abd105be0aeb18a306d83.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://miriadna.com/desctopwalls/images/max/The-palace.jpg\" style=\"max-width:70%;\"/><br><br/><i>\"Worship a god that teaches you how to love others, that encourages you to never stop growing.

The temple itself was unfortunately too small to accommodate the entire population. There were people from all the clans of the Land-Tiller's tribe. The Celadine, the Acacia, the Saskatoon, the Dittany, the Redwood, the Ivy, and many others were represented. There were also many people from the Phoenix State.The bridge was Lai Ban's idea. It was a bit of a silly one, but the truth was the people who came here were used to silly ideas. Her audience included friendly people, old souls, and free thinkers from around the Phoenix Imperium. There was a strange, hidden peace to the not-so-subtle mess that was the crowd, the exception being maybe the children. Lai-Ban was especially aware of all the children, who of course had no idea what was going on and probably just wanted to go home. She smirked when she realized she could still clearly remember what it was like to be two feet tall.As she floated on the boat towards the center of the bridge, she noticed that a few of the faces were still grim. She understood this. After all, she essentially came out of no where, and now claimed to be the authority on a thousands of year old way of life. To make matters worse, she had tangible evidence of an actual deity, in which many ways threatened the old ways of thinking. Lai Ban could insist that people were free to worship as they wished, over and over again, but in the end it would still take time for them to fully adjust to her presence.Finally the boat made it to the center. Most of the crowd on the bridge had a good view of her. She was pleased this was happening on such a beautiful day. The sun clearly reflected on the blue waters, and there was a light breeze in the air. The scent of newly blooming frangipanis from the edges of the water added a unique flavor to the environment. It was as though nature itself had given her the blessing she needed to start the morning ceremony.\"Blessings to those of you who are in hell, for your journey shall be full of wonders.Blessings to those of you who hunger, for you will know the compassion and love of others.Blessings to those of you who are young, for one day you shall be elders of wisdom.Blessings to those of you who have a passion for life, for you will build the world.Blessings to those of you who understand the world, for you are its true guardians.Blessings to those of you who are wealthy, for you may fill the voids of this world.Blessings to those of you who who seek higher truth, for you tread the beginning of the final path.Blessings to those of you who have understood, for you may teach others.Blessings to those of you who love your neighbors and embrace the light, for you are approaching the gods.\"Amen. Here here! *clap clap clap*\u00a0Amen. Here here! *clap clap clap*\u00a0Amen. Here here! *clap clap clap*\"You know we should probably extend the bridge out this way... you know, so we could fit more people.\"The crowd chuckled . A few nodded their approval, since apparently this was a legitimately good idea.\"In addition to today's beatitudes, I wish to make an announcement. Soon, there will be a grand festival, in celebration, of humanity's triumph over the Cataclysm. Those of you who were born in the Expanse may not be aware that we are not the only ones who suffered great tragedy. The truth is, the whole world has been struggling, not just with natural disaster and violence, but with their own feelings of hopelessness and despair and fear. When the world takes our civilizations away, humanity enters its own hell, one which can take many generations to escape.\"There were murmurs and more nods of agreement from the people.\"The truth is, compassion and unity are things we all desire, deep down inside. We are all born with the desire to walk the path towards light. There are those of us who would see the order of the world as a great triumph against nature. And some ways this is true. But I also see it as an inevitability. Humanity is destined to find the light, to find harmony and prosperity. The act of learning and growing is what makes us who we are!\"There was some more cheering from the crowd.\"Let us rejoice in the prosperity of the world. Let us rejoice in Medan, in Isra, in the Phoenix State, in the Land-Tiller's Expanse, in Atlanticus, in Gauldin, and in Sakand. Let us rejoice, for humanity has rebuilt itself from the cataclysm. We live in a world where many languages and cultures may mix freely, where humans and orcs and elves, and halflings and dwarves, and yet even dragons, may be friends! We live in a world of infinite possibilities. And soon we will celebrate those possibilities. Soon, we will all walk the path together!\"Amen. Here here! *clap clap clap* Amen. Here here! *clap clap clap* Amen. Here here! *clap clap clap*\"Now, there is one last thing I wanna say. I know there are some concerns about the role of the Chaos Phoenix in our spiritual beliefs. I cannot stress enough that the Phoenix is not here to eradicate or change our ways. It is here to serve as a guardian. We have been gifted with a heritage of openness, and although we've had our own challenges, the freedom to worship as we choose is part of our legacy. The Chaos Phoenix merely agrees with us.\"There was a sudden rush of wind, and a great light appeared over the congregation. A massive, bird-like creature, consisting of energy and what appeared to be purple flames, revealed itself.It cried out, its howl surprisingly easy on the ears. It came to an easy crescendo and an easy fall, a soft warbling undercutting its cry. Still, it could be heard from the other side of the temple.\"This creature, is not our new god. This creature, is our friend, our protector, and a teacher. No matter what our faiths, what we all have in common is a desire for spiritual growth and love, a desire for inner peace, a way to the light. The Chaos Phoenix would have us continue on this path! Worship your own gods. Don't worship any gods! Worship the god within you if you must. But always follow the path of truth, the path of love for your fellow humans. Follow the path towards the light.\"Slowly the creature faded away, back into the celestial plane.\"And remember, there is no shame in having been stained with darkness. There is no shame in what is human. The only shame we must feel is when we allow those who are suffering to surrender, when we could have helped them. It is a regret many of us have experienced, including myself. We must forever be vigilant. Though we may not succeed in helping everyone, we must always try our best. We must learn forgiveness. We must learn compassion. We must learn to love others. The Phoenix gains nothing for being our guardian. It does so out of the compassion of its own heart. So too must we show compassion for others. We are not all born in the light, but we can all end there.\"Lai Ban waited for applause. Many people cheered at the presence of the celestial entity, and many more praised Lai Ban's words. And yet there were still those who viewed the creature with fear and the direction of the tribe with dismay.Lai Ban sighed. Maybe someday...The ceremony would go on for a bit longer, and would include discussions on the temple's logistics and some new guests. Eventually Lai Ban would finish, and then she would retreat back into the temple.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.gyazo.com/6ca1a7051a3f89f5fd1d84e70438e9ae.png"], "html": "A great number of people were congregating along the bridge.

Although his guards were silent he could still feel their unease at the amount of escorts. The several carriages, pulled by skeletal horses. Had taken a while to reach the great river. It reminded the ambassador of the one that use to run through his kingdom, all those thousands of years ago. Getting into the await boats was also a difficult issue, as there wasn't enough boats of sufficient size to carry the carriages. So, after a quick spell or two on each of the carriages, three of them began to walk into the river itself, the cargo, protected by a small shield. The skeletons uncaring about the water, still being flanked by a few of the dead were quickly lost to the water. As the rest of the envoy made it to the other side, the heads of the diving horses could be seen coming out of the water at the same time. Dripping wet they reached dry land, the water dropping slowly off their bare skulls and rib cages. But the cargo itself was bone dry. Satisfied by this the ambassador lead the envoy towards the great fortification. He could sense the use of magic everywhere here, more so than when he was travelling though the outskirts of the nation. Yet that was the magic of the dead, and here, it had been mixed with other types of magic as well. Interesting, the Chief Librarian would be most interested in this place. Stopping before the great gates of the castle the envoy slowed to a halt. Touching his dried husk of a hand to his throat and weaving a spell to amplify his voice he spoke, clearly as he could with a partially destroyed voice box. \"We come in ... peace.

In some places, he could even feel the used and discarded corpses themselves, buried deep underground. At least for them, death was a release.

She had always been in Gauldin, and the Land Tillers' State was the very first place she'd been to outside of Gauldin.That is, except for where it was she disappeared to when she had been swept to sea for ten months, a story that seemed as if would always remain a mystery.

In fact, your majesties, if you're willing I wouldn't mind discussing some of our past and social views.\" Lai Ban would walk them over to a more secluded part of the little island, a garden facing the water. The worshipers would know better than to follow. They had the impression that Renaux and Arianne were important people. Across the water they would see a few boats floating about, and a few winged beasts in the sky.Lai Ban invited them to sit in a circular seating area so they could all address each other easily. \"Since you asked so many questions, I hope you don't mind me giving many answers. First of all, yes, we were once called the temple of the chaos phoenix. You see, this religion is one of the few that did not originate in the expanse. It in fact originated from a kingdom to the north called the Phoenix Imperium. Recently their kingdom seems to have fallen into disarray with the disappearance of their leadership. Although this is somewhat disconcerting...\" Lai Ban would become hesitant to speak. \"Frankly I don't mind all that much. Their people were rather... war-like. They were obsessed with conquest and we were afraid for the longest time that we would be drawn into a conflict. It almost happened several times, with Goraia and Aaedan. Now that the kingdom has all but vanished, we've made some changes.I hope you don't find this next part too alarming. The entity known as the phoenix, is in fact a real entity. It is not a god exactly, but a very powerful species of holy creature. The Phoenix Imperium was originally founded by one such creature, a wrathful being known as the red phoenix. This creature had several offspring, one of which was known as the Phoenix of Mercy. Of all these creatures, the Phoenix of Mercy is the most understanding and peaceful, and most sympathetic to the struggles and pain of the darkness. It is also the creature whom I serve as a host for. Hence why I am the high priest of this temple.To explain why it was originally called the Chaos Phoenix, first I must explain our beliefs and history a bit more in-depth. Our many different clans have many different beliefs, but there are certain core concepts which are shared among most if not all clans. One of them is balance. Light and darkness, order and chaos, male and female, everything must be in balance to serve the ultimate goal, which is the preservation of life itself. Generally we are a peaceful people who try to live in harmony with nature. But occasionally we experience war and strife. It is usually those times when the chaos mages appear.Chaos mages are entities of incredible power. They are granted dominion over the elements by the earth itself as a means of restoring balance, particularly against stagnation and the halting of progress. Order is not always a good thing, if it prevents evil and darkness from being excised, or if it prevents spiritual growth. Chaos mages serve as a counter-balance and help shatter the current order, usually for the benefit of our people in the long run. One of the defining characteristics of a chaos mage is the ability to wield both light and dark magic on equal terms.Anyways, that is the reason why the Phoenix of Mercy was originally known as the chaos phoenix, for it too grants me the power to wield light and darkness. But the reason why it can do this is because it has an in-depth understanding of darkness. Things we refer to as pain, sorrow, wrath, lust, these... expressions of human needs and desires, it understands them and is merciful towards them.I suppose this finally brings me to what it is our religion teaches. The principle message of the Phoenix of Mercy is to find your own path towards the light, to accept and understand your darkness, and to show that understanding towards others. The virtues of balance and honesty are held beyond all others. Darkness and evil cannot be cured if they are not understood, if we are not honest about them. They do not exist in a vacuum. These practices tie into one of the basic truths most of us are taught as children, that all life is connected. While this is true on a physical level, we seek to elevate this truth to a spiritual level. We should treat our interactions with each other with care, for they have real consequences for each other. This is also how we address the issue of the poor and needy. Many of the worshipers here were, in fact, one poor and needy. At this temple, we take the time to understand how each person arrived in their circumstances, whether it was misfortune, disease, or some personal failing like addiction or wrath, and we help them as best we can with food and resources, while also helping them make their lives meaningful. Some of them return to work on the farms, or learn the ways of magic. Those that truly cannot function are free to stay here and study the ways of the phoenix. We are fortunate in that food is the one thing our people are not lacking.\" She chuckled.Lai Ban started tapping her chin with the tip of her finger. \"There is one more thing. While it is true that conflict is rare in our culture, we are far from perfect. Sometimes are people can be judgmental of the ways of other nations. They can develop a prejudice or superiority complex, which is fueled by the perception that other nations view us as primitive. Most of our metallurgy and crafting, most of our metal weapons and even our more sophisticated architecture, was built by other nations. Thus, while on the outside our people seem quite friendly... their underlying fears and insecurities can make them surprisingly dangerous and powerful foes. Our people have a very strong warrior instinct deep within them. I don't consider that a blessing. In fact, for a time, the Phoenix Imperium's culture threatened to take over our own precisely by resonating with this warrior instinct. We now have a mandatory military training program because of them, and even with their disappearance I don't think it is going anywhere.\" Lai Ban scowled slightly. \"We actually faced a major civil war about 50 years ago partially because those of us who were more blessed with magic saw themselves as superior to those of us who weren't. There was rampant discrimination and class-ism.\"She turned in particular to Arianne. During her explanation her face had grown more and more grave. \"Our people are not innocent hatchlings. We are not naive fools. The reason we seem so idyllic is because we try very, very hard. We work to maintain peace and understand among ourselves. Because we know deep down inside we have the capacity to be cruel and dangerous. Our connection to the earth affords many of us with magic power, and thus we must strive to be responsible and not let the mistakes of the past repeat themselves.\"Lai Ban's solemn countenance suddenly broke with an insecure, demure grin. \"I apologize. I spoke so much! I don't even think I answered all your questions properly! Politics. Well, long story short... though I guess it's too late for that... let us just say, the Elder's Council likes me more now that the Phoenix Imperium has disappeared.\" She turned to King Renaux of Trav\u00e9re . \"Actually, that will probably make more sense to you I imagine.\"", "link_list": ["/user/889"], "image_list": [], "html": "Lai Ban nodded and grinned politely at all of Arianne's inquiries, but she pursed her lips somewhat when she got to the part about the Land-Tillers being a paradise."}, "post-40500": {"user": "King Renaux of Trav\u00e9re", "user_num": 889, "timestamp": "1465185184000", "message": "Renaux nods as he is introduced to the priestess and follows her to the secluded area.

In other words while one might prefer to remain in the light, one must embrace aspects of themselves they would rather avoid.

She placed herself in a lotus position and invited both the king and queen to join her. \"Bel, nahl kun.\"A gentle light flashed next to her. An odd, pendulum-like structure materialized. The swinging hammer rested in between two plates. Lai Ban reached out and tapped the hammer. It swung back and forth, striking one bell, then another. The first bell produced a pleasant high pitch and the second a low pitch.She turned to Arianne. \"The first thing you must understand is that all our emotions and thoughts are natural consequences of our experiences and choices, and that we are constantly changing as people. We are never locked into light and darkness per se. We can always change and grow. You must take the time to understand why you act the way you act and have the thoughts that you have. With understanding comes forgiveness, and with forgiveness comes peace. That may be difficult if you are not compassionate towards yourself.\"Lai Ban's head rocked gently back and forth to the sound of her own construct. She grinned self-consciously. \"Each of these sounds represents two sides of duality. They are part of a meditation which helps you be aware of the duality of the universe. I would recommend not conceptualizing them as light and dark. Try something else, perhaps... try father and mother. You see, we all possess different instincts to help us cope with life, different energies if you will. One of these is much more physical, protective of the outside, and dynamic. We'll call that father. One is more introspective, subtle, protective of the inner self, and nurturing. We'll call that mother. All conscious beings have both of these, including both of your majesties. Both of these can express themselves in positive, loving ways, but they can also be corrupted and cause pain. Whatever problems you suffer may be a result of a corruption of these natures. Becoming aware of them and understanding towards them can help you heal, and perhaps help you with your nightmares.\"The pendulum bell continued to chim. \"Forgive me, once again I am overloading you two with information. Although the explanation behind this exercise could be studied for years, the actual practice is quite simple. You only need to relax, breath and silence your thoughts.\"If Arianne and Renaux would join her. Lai Ban would guide her through the meditation process.\"Focus on your breathing. Let go of your thoughts... Inhale and exhale, concern yourselves only with inhaling and exhaling to the sounds... if you wish...\"This would go on for several minutes. \"Go ahead and adjust your posture if you find this uncomfortable. The most important thing, is bringing peace to your thoughts...\"The pendulum continued to chime. \"Father... mother... father... mother... feel both of these within you, and within the universe, the stars... Forget about everything else...\"......After about ten minutes, Lai Ban would take a very deep breath and chuckle. \"Ok, you can stop now. How do you two feel? You should feel more relaxed and calm now, both of you. But tell me what you experienced. Don't be embarrased if you feel that you, uh, how shall we say, did it wrong? Did either of you experience anything odd?\"Lai Ban thought it unlikely that either of them had completely mastered the technique right away. It had its benefits even if done \"poorly\", acting as a stress reliever. But if done properly, what one would have experienced was an odd movement, almost like a presence, between the left and right side of their inner world, as if an energy was moving from side to side in their brains. This would signify a higher sense of awareness between the duality of nature and the human soul, but it was often only achievable to those whose spiritualities were unobstructed by severe worldly concerns. Immediate mastery would be reserved for the likes of high level spiritual beings like Lum'Valia. Even holy warriors in training such as Jun or Arya would have some difficultly.In other words, neither Arianne or Renaux would be likely to feel the movement.

There was an archway leading outside the temple, into a garden. White stone benches and smaller statues dotted the landscape, which was otherwise filled with grass and some flowers.

They have structured minds to help them cope with the natural complexities of the world. Two such categories are what we would call good and evil, light and dark, or perhaps higher and lower. Light magic tends to resonate with thoughts and feelings of one category, and dark magic resonates with thoughts and feelings of the other. I don't need to go into detail as to what is entailed in these categories. And regardless, they are highly subjective. It is possible to learn both kinds of magic separately, but to utilize them both at once requires a mind which has either understood and accept both sides, or transcended them completely. Chaos mages are chosen for their natural talent at acceptance. The Phoenix is an entity who transcends. Because these two forms of magic seem quite different from each other, their combined effects are extremely difficult to counter, thus producing exceptionally powerful spells.\"By now they would have made it to the garden. Grandma would notice the temple as a whole rested on a hill in the middle of the lake. The garden was in fact next to the edge of the water. Lai Ban would make her way over to a point where she was overlooking the water. \"The phoenix gets a bit... boisterous, when it senses a power rivaling it.\" Lai Ban gave an evil little grin. \"It wants to know if you'd like me to demonstrate over the water.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Lai Ban put a single finger on her dainty chin. \"I suppose you wouldn't know, would you?\" She gave her a sly look. \"Let's walk to the gardens outside.\" She would lead Grandma through the temple towards the very back, where a large marble statue of the phoenix was flanked by several large symbolic objects.

It was quite a peaceful atmosphere, positively serene. Of course, that was to be expected in a temple of such quality as this one.Listening to the priestesses explanation, Grandma would offer the occasional nod. The way she explained it was about what Grandma had expected and satisfactorily answered her question. Humans always viewed different types of magic with emotions and other needless limiters. Grandma was used to simply viewing the various types of magic at a base level of replication. Due to this she often forgot humans and many other species required their emotions and beliefs to be put in certain types of magic. It was really something she could keep in mind.Grandma would smile slightly herself at the message Lai Ban relayed from the phoenix.\u201cThe phoenix seems to have quite the personality.

Her countenance was as serene as could be. A gentle breeze flicked at some stray strands about her hair.At this point Grandma would likely start to feel a sizeable amount of mana gathering around them. Lai Ban's aura from when they first met returned, and the Phoenix's presence made itself known. As the seconds went by, an ethereal outline of the creature, mostly wings, solidified at the priestess' back. A few seconds more and two wells of energy formed on both sides of Lai Ban's body. One side seemed to overflow with blackness. The sensation the aura would elicit would be lust, anger, and a desire to control. On the other side would be a calm, peaceful whiteness best described as \"love\". Soon these wells would become visible in the form of two auras, one a deep purple, and the other a shining white.Then Lai Ban separated her hands and opened her eyes. One of her eyes would glow violently violet, and the other bright white. Lai Ban extended her hands outwards; her palms faced the water. \"Chaos Art: Twilight Dancers.\"The air exploded out of the way. Massive amounts of light and dark energy gushed out of each palm. The large masses would coalesce into two serpent heads, which were larger than the size of most real dragon heads. The massive energy serpents whipped and writhed outward with shocking speed over the water, illuminating the entire face of the temple. They persisted for several seconds before disappearing.It was a spell clearly capable of felling most dragons almost instantly.\"Phew. Sorry for the interruption!\" Lai Ban turned back to the no-longer meditating monks; their mouths were agape and they struggled to utter a \"no problem\" in a voice an octave higher than usual.\"So...\" Lai Ban turned to Grandma. \"I showed you mind. Will you show me yours?\" She smirked. \"Or maybe you'd rather give that one a shot. Even I'm curious as to why the Phoenix holds you in such high regard. I'm not even sure what you are exactly.\" Her eyes had a certain spark looking at Grandma.

Tell me, how old is the Phoenix?\u201dGrandma intently studies Lai Ban and the Phoenix as the spell was cast. She was focusing on the specifics, how much mana they used to make it, how much light and dark magic they used, how they combined the two sources of magic. It was an impressive spell they cast, Grandma would have to make note of it for if she ever tried to cast it herself. As they finished up, she offered the pair a number of rather slow claps.\u201cVery nice, very nice. An impressive spell, you seem to have very good control over shaping the magic. I\u2019m sure the people at this temple feel safe with you watching over it, especially after that demonstration.\u201dAt the request of her casting a spell, Grandma would let out another laugh. She had no intention of casting from her full potential, but she would still cast something to satisfy the pair.\u201cVery well, I suppose it wouldn\u2019t be fair of me to leave you two empty handed in this exchange of spells.\u201dRelinquishing the first level of her restraints, which retained her human form but gave her access to her true mana pool as well as significantly increased control over her spells. On the downside, those magically attuned nearby would feel an aura that clearly didn\u2019t belong to a human, it was a completely unnatural presence. However, as she always disguised and limited her powers, she figured the two would assume this was her at her full power. Hopefully, they would be satisfied with this demonstration.Raising her walking cane, Grandma pointed it towards the lake, channeling through it. For this form, the cane was extremely efficient at amplifying the power of her spells and she intended to take full use of that fact. Drawing from the ley lines in addition to her own supply of mana, Grandma would cast the spell, her eyes turning pitch black as she did so. Lai Ban might notice no emotions were coming from Grandma as she channeled, a rather strange occurrence for many mages.A hundred feet out or so in the water, the air would begin to warp. A nothingness would begin to appear and everything around it would begin bending, pulled toward it. Although at first, the pulling was weak, it would grow stronger, eventually resulting in a wide sheet of water below it to begin rising out of the water towards it. Then Lai Ban would feel a slight tug, originating from a sphere of nothingness. That was when Grandma ended the spell, the nothingness vanishing and the large sheet of water falling back into the lake with a crash. \u201cAre you satisfied priestess?
