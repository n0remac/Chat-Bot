You got your snails and shell fish at the bottom of the river. That'll be what your swimming for. You got your fish in the middle of the water, which you got nets and poles for, and you got the sea weed at the top. You gotta either balance yourself on those beams there...\" He pointed at several long beams reaching out into the water.

But if they get passed our wards, well, it's a bit of an acquired taste, but Maya makes a hell of an otter stew.\"He raised up his finger. His face suddenly became quite serious. \"Now here's the real trick to having a successful water farm. You gotta harvest the right proportions of each thing. You catch a certain number of snails, you also gotta dredge some see weed, and grab some snails and shellfish, and catch some bony fish. Everyone keeps a careful tally of what they're harvesting, and towards the end of the first shift, during our lunch break, we all check the tallies and see what we need to compensate here and there. Sometimes if our balance is way off, we gotta call some special elemental mages to help the kelp grow faster. That's usually what gets over-harvested. Oh, and you also gotta be careful not to over harvest the younger, more fertile animals, especially the females. Gotta keep the population healthy, ya know?\"Assuming Zar'Dura and Daris'Fall were somewhat overwhelmed by the information dump, the fisherman would smile genially once again. \"I know it sounds complicated, but we don't expect you guys to be perfect, so we'll let some mistakes slide. But us Badgers take a lot of pride in our work as water farmers!
