When they made it out of this, she was going to give him a serious talking to. With the lion half dying, she yanked her blade out and wedged it in the toothy maw, levering it open so that she could pull her leg out of the lion's mouth. Then she rolled away from the goat head and snake tail, and also out of the glyph which had ceased forming and was now pulsing violently. As soon as she was out of the glyph's border, she smacked a hand down on the edge, which caused it to flare vividly. Razor sharp spikes of crystal shot up out of the glyph, each twelve feet long and angled to impale the creature that had been attacking her.<br><br/>But Naenia didn't stop there. As soon as she activated the glyph, she was on her feet and unfolding her wings as the crystalline shell disappeared, then launching into flight. She soared after the chimera that was chasing Aechon at top speeds as more spikes began to sprout up across the surface of her crystal armor. Thrusting her sword out ahead of her with a roar of anger, she aligned herself with the beast's body at a trajectory for a broadside strike, intending to slam into the left side of its torso with all of her strength. Between her sword and the crystal spikes all over her body, she hoped to do some damage.</br></font>"}, "post-37641": {"user": null, "user_num": null, "timestamp": "1463182054000", "message": "He managed to get up the tree and kept climbing, intent on getting as high as possible so the monster couldn't reach him.
