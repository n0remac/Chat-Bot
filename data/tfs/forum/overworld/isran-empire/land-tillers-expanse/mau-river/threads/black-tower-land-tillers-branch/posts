It is an impressive establishment, though, consisting of a series of boxy buildings with red-domed roofs that are found up a number of easily-defensible stairways, and behind a number of thick walls with heavy, strong doors designed to repel all but the most powerful and determined attacks. Residing atop a rocky promontory on the banks of the Mau River, its location near the Elder's Valley is designed to be a sign of the unity between the Black Tower and the leadership of the Land-Tillers.The various buildings serve as barracks, armory, stables, and various other necessary facilities for the employees of the Black Tower. While the number of staff at this branch is small compared to both the main and Gauldin branches, there is still a full complement of the usual workers, covering guardsmen, scribes, clerks, and Dwarven smiths. Like the Isra and Gauldin branches, the entire structure is comprised of rune-enchanted stone designed to reach its full capabilities when being filled with mana by specially-trained Black Tower mages.

Grandma might recognize them as glyph diagrams. However there was no magic to them. They were just notes.As she did this, she spoke calmly. \"Well, I wanted to ask your advice, and maybe your assistance, in designing something to protect the Expanse.

And so you understand why we might not want the Black Tower to say, construct another Kami to loom over the Expanse. We appreciate learning from other cultures but we don't want to be at their mercy. We want our dignity. And so I was thinking, what can we design that would help us defend ourselves, but be uniquely ours? Or at the very least something that feels like a true joint project.\"Grandma might notice some of the diagrams had question marks on them. Jun blushed. \"Yah it's a pretty rough design. Still lots of holes. Here.\"She pointed to a map of the Expanse. \"Our two most powerful defenses are the Guardian Wizard Tower and the Temple of Mercy. They are home to our most powerful mages.

The idea was to use floating platforms to direct the firepower of the Phoenix of Mercy and the Guardian Tower, and maybe even the Black Tower, anywhere along the Land-Tiller's border. The spells wouldn't necessarily have to be offensive in nature. The Phoenician Lai Ban could cast a Seraphim Seal of Chastity at the temple and drop it onto a battle zone, causing a magical cessation of all violence. \"What do you think?

They want a defense system kind of like Isra's, but unique, something that they had a hand in creating. I've been messing around with an idea in my spare time, but I've decided with Grandma's help to actually try to get it built.\"One of the pages had a map of the Expanse, with three locations marked. \"The most heavily fortified locations in the Expanse are the Black Tower, the Guardian Tower, and the Temple of the Phoenix. They each have their own potent magic defenses which could have made short work of most of those threats. So I was thinking, what if there was a way to bring their spells to bear anywhere in the Expanse. What me and Grandma are working on is a scrying network set up throughout the expanse, and a portal system that allows magic portals to appear over any hostile target identified by the scrying network. The other end of the portal would open up to a platform built in these three locations. From there a team of powerful mages, including the Elder himself or perhaps even Grandma here, if necessary, can fire their strongest spells through the portal. It would be like having our strongest defenders guarding every inch of the Expanse at the same time. The portal would be one way, so they wouldn't be in danger. And it's a much more energy-efficient system than say, Goraia's weapon.\"She also pointed to the magic orbs that she went through the trouble of obtaining in Steelscape. \"And now we have a power source for the portal system. The reason why I called you, Sir Tristian, is because I still believe we'll need the Black Tower's help in constructing the system. For instance, we'll need more scrying devices. But, it'll be a joint project between the Land-Tillers and the Black Tower, and it'll greatly boost both reputations. Grandma likes the idea. What about you?
