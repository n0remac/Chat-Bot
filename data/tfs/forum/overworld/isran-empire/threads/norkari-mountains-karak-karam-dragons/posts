Their existence is largely forgotten to time, any knowledge of them lost during the cataclysm that ravaged the world a century before. Only a select few know what vast cities, treasures, and tombs lay beneath the cold, expressionless mountain faces. Behind their forested facade and collapsed arches sit tremendous cities, carved into the rock by the talented hands and tools of the ancient dwarves that once ruled over the mountains as kings, looking down on all of the surface-kin, with their little towns and villages, nothing that could hold a candle to the dwarves themselves. These cities bore deep into the mountains, colonising more and more as they mined deeper, and deeper, soon connecting each hold and city in a vast series of underground tunnels. Little did they know this would be their downfall.  Each of these cities now lays in ruin, with mere dusty echoes of ancient ghosts to fill them. Rubble clogs the vast stone doors, and charred wood supports have long since collapsed, leaving the tunnels that once lead from ale house to home, and mine to armoury, buried under rock and stone. Meeting halls that once housed hundreds of cheery dwarves, hollering and singing of triumphs, tales, and tribulations, where the hold lords would declare war and peace, new grudges, and the settling of old, are now occupied only by the charred bones and mangled weapons of the once brave defenders, their ghosts now silently raging in their forgotten tomb. The vast vaults that once held the riches the Dwarves so greedily hoarded used to gleam and glow with piles of gold, jewels, and other valuables dug up from the deep or plundered from the dwarves\u2019 enemies, all carefully sorted and valued by a team of the most honourable, trustworthy, and noble dwarves, are all but empty, with only dust to occupy their place. Only one vault remains true to its golden reputation. The Vault of Karak Karam-Az, the mountain capital that once housed the golden throne of the dwarven high King. Deep within the once grand city, now a craterous ruin, houses a vault teeming with gold, far beyond its former peak in the glory years of Dwarven rule. The precious contents coming from not only Karak Karam-Az, but every other dwarven ruin that dot the mountain side, all piled into one vast chamber. Many an adventurer dreams of such a place, the lost city of dwarven gold, but nobody has ever found it. At least, nobody who lived to tell the tale. Not everything in these ruins is dead, for among the bones and under the vast golden hoard, lays the creature that laid waste to the glorious dwarves, taking their home and hoard, and leaving their people without a king. The dragon known in the dwarven runes of old as Grundesdyg. Anyone who finds and dares enter the ruins should be warned. They will not find the glory nor riches they seek. They will find only death at the claws of the Scourge of Dwarves.

To steal from a dragon carries the price of death, and this is non negotiable. This is my life's work, and I will not have greedy hands attempt to take it from me.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"What services?\" The dragon asks, followed by a long, thoughtful hiss from deep down inside his gullet. He shifts and raises his head above Finch for a few moments. \"Strength. Wisdom. I have lived many years and there are few stronger than me outside of my own kind. If the payment and enemy is right, I may be persuaded to eliminate your little empire's enemies, as I would expect Isra to aid me in eliminating my own.\" "}, "post-96236": {"user": "Elizabeth Finch", "user_num": 1337, "timestamp": "1585762703000", "message": "\"I assure you we will not tolerate any theft on behalf of our own.

I just wanted to be sure the option was there, lest asking for it later lead to insult.\" Liz stated, not addressing the intimidation part. A part of her wanted to go to toe-to-toe with him, to test herself against the ultimate foe. She wondered if there was a way to spar with a dragon without causing permanent damage or death to either of them. \"Are there enemies you would refuse to fight against?

Your history only goes to the end times, a century ago. I have lived twice that, and my forefathers who\u2019s memories I hold go back millennia. I know of patterns and events that may make mortal blood run cold.\u201d Then he grins again. \u201cOr my knowledge will bring solace. I am not one to mince words, little Finch, nor am I one to lie. Only time till tell what your little empire will do with such information.\u201d To go toe-to-toe with a dragon, particularly this dragon, would be a mistake Finch would only make once. His size, several times the size of her, raw strength, and almost impervious scales would make short work of a human and her griffin. Thankfully, the dragon has made it clear he doesn\u2019t care for a fight, so that is unlikely to happen. \u201cI?\u201d the dragon asks, considering it. \u201cI have no enemies, but I am the enemy to many.\u201d He lifts his head in thought, then gestures to the hall around them. \u201cThe dwarves that once occupied this range, if they still live, would consider me a mortal enemy. I hold no grudge against them, for my revenge is complete. They attacked me, I took their home and gold. I have no desire to wipe them from this tired world. Other dragons would consider me an enemy for my gold, but none know I am here.\u201d His massive head lowers to meet Finch\u2019s. \u201cBut I have no enemies. I will fight those I wish to fight, on request, or on payment. Wars are tedious, however, I have seen far too many and they do very little to change the world.
