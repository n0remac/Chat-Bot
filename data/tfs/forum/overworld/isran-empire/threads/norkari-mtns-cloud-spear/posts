Meanwhile Jun was becoming light-headed. \"Cold... cold... cold...\" She was wearing a thick fur coat over her armor, but even then her defenses were getting overwhelmed.One advantage she did have was her headpiece, which with its holy properties actually helped her cells continue to metabolize normally even with the reduced oxygen levels. But even so, this was not a pleasant experience. She didn't dare summon flames as she did not want to risk hurting her ride.SQUAWK! The massive demon crow was disgruntled to say the least. Jun tried her best to reassure him. \"It's ok. I'll use Blueberry next time. Consider it a compliment.\" She carefully caressed the bird underneath its neck.Slowly they ascended their way past several rocky outcroppings. \"Ehhh... huh, it does feel kinda warm here.\" Then they would spot the opening to the cavern.

It was damn near frozen, but being in the warm cavern actually made it somewhat appetizing. Blackbean took the hunk of meat in its powerful beak and snapped it up.

It squawked in maligned resignation and lightly jabbed the top of her head before disappearing into the shadows. \"OUCH!\" Jun grimaced and ruffled her hair while giving the disappearing demon stink eye. (She had to appreciate the clever bird's humor though. Her so-called helmet was more of a crown, and while very effective against magic, it technically did little against physical attacks from behind). When he had left, she began to drag the meat sack down into the cavern. The temperature rapidly increased, though again her helmet gave her some protection against the elements.

Then she fired a blast of fire energy at a point on the ground behind her, shattering the rock. \"Vokrii!\" She shouted. A white energy radiated from her body and also encompassed the shards of rock, which fell back into place. She had essentially \"healed\" the rock.

The plasma blast wasn't too bad, but teleportation and Lum'Valia's healing spell were very costly. In less than a minute her mana was depleted.However, she did have a power source left. She pulled out her macuahuitl. She reopened the cut in her hand. As the blood poored out it became a bright magenta color.

That's when she realized that even on a subconscious level, she couldn't bare being separated... in other words, subconsciously she must have still had some mana in reserve.And she was too scared to deplete it completely.But if what Fundor was saying was true, the surrounding energy could be used by her, somehow.Could the natural forces... sing back?Jun took a deep breath. She felt around in her mind, in her heart, seeking out the fear she had of losing her connection with nature, and she focused more and more on letting go.\"Let go. Let go. Let go...\"This took several minutes. It wasn't easy. To her it felt like overcoming a fear of death itself. In a sense this was true. With absolutely no mana, there was nothing stopping Fundor from instant killing her. The best she could hope for was to use blood magic in a suicide attack... Just like Lynx did-Lynx didn't fear death.Bolts of mana began to spark and sizzle from Jun's body as she continued to mutter the phrase \"Let go.\" After a few seconds, the mana faded away and Jun collapsed on her knees and stared on the ground, wide-eyed.Now she really was out of mana.\"I... feel... naked...

You're an idiot.You can do it!Her other selves were arguing in her mind. You should give up now. Not when you've come this far!Jun seethed.

NOT... done.\"This was definitely no joke. The sensation was a strange one, one of loneliness and anguish. The elements, they were gone. She couldn't reach out to them, commune with them, sing to them.They were gone.But were they really gone? Fundor said the energy around her could be used. In a sense, the elements had to be able to reach back. After recovering, Jun reached out towards the lava, trying to feel the heat as much as possible, imagining it as a friend, as lending a hand. She tried to cast a spell again.Once again she felt a horrific pain in her chest, like everything in her body just wanted to stop. \"GAHH!\" She screamed audibly and scrunched into a fetal position. There were tears in her eyes.But once again she did not allow Fundor to say anything.Her last attempt would probably kill her.Bleating like an injured sheep, Jun restored herself to at least a kneeling position. I have to do this. I have to do this...I have to do this.I have to do this.Jun squinted at the lava. \"I'm not going to die here-\" Jun was interrupted by a loud cough. She couldn't help herself and lurched forward, spitting out a thin spray of blood. It started to glow, but then Jun squirmed and squealing and scrunched her eyes together until the blood returned to its normal form. Oddly enough the intense heat from the lava was now at the bottom of her list of concerns-\"Wait a second... That could be it. The heat... My body doesn't WANT to feel the heat.\" Jun began to remove her armor, one piece at a time, and set it down next to her head piece. She even went as far as removing her rig. With no mana in her body it was no good to her anyway. Jun was basically now in t-shirt and underwear. A thin cotton cloth separated her and the intense heat of the lava, which she now started to walk closer towards. Her feet felt like they were burning. Her skin was soaked in sweat, which did nothing since even the sweat itself was heating up.\"If I die Fundor... Lum'Valia was a better teacher than you.\"Jun took a deep breath. But something caught her off-guard. Something, a presence, felt like it was trying to enter her lungs.The heat... is your friend, your ally, the element itself is your friend!\"Fire Art...\" Jun said this in between a frantic gasping of breath. Her heart still hurt badly and she felt light-headed. Whatever euphoria she was feeling from her daring attempt wouldn't last. One more failure and she was dead. \"Fire Art...\"More of the presence entered her lungs. It caressed her face, her hands, her entire body. Soon she began to glow with a faint yellow.She opened her eyes. They were glowing.\"PLASMA BLAST!\" She swung around and faced away from the fire.
