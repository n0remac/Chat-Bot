Magical glyphs idling glowing in tones of red, green, white and yellow, T'jarae; A Fey'Ri naturally, concentrating her four first constructs in the shape of rather narrow diamond. The red one in the front, the green one on the left, the white one on the right. T'J says the words: 'Yinsin'; Bright flashing Teal lights and hues, another three more constructs appear.Confident in her step, she move to set some basic protection runes around her new household. T'J then signals them to move into position behind her store. The constructs, all of them, form a magical barrier that spreads out for several meters then stop to form a line of 'magical arrows'. To not attack, but more so point in the direction in which her shopped was named \u2018Finder\u2019s Abyss of Knowledge\u2019.Sometime before this, she summoned a few minor golems to quickly organize the spaces of the architecture. A bed, a standing stable placement room(for the books that would go on her bookshelves), a separate room that had an enchanted lock -- or a Golden/Ruby in place; Fit for her treasury room and lastly, another for relic, rune, tome and to keep track of customers, buyers, the like that would come down to trade with her. She folds her arms, mostly satisfied. \"Should expect guest coming here soon, only about two miles inside New Brimiarde.\" Light clicking, T'J steps inside in store. Finished filling up her things that were satisfactory, T\u2019J summons a Golden Claw glass cup and a bottle of really deep Red Wine. (For reference to her store\u2019s rooms):[Entrance] -- Protected by three idle constructs. One on the left, one on the right, and one in the center.[Form of a lobby] -- Acts as a lobbyist's room. Fit for five or twelve people at a time. At least four different couches, a large glossy-Cherry Wood table; In the shape of a large oval, two chandlers, burning brightly with golden candles(least three). Hanging by silver chains that shined ever so even in the light. The room would be as big as a master bed-bathroom fit for two people but converted for more than that. T\u2019J would be stationed at the opposite side of table. A teal and purple throne-like chair, with two motioning Crystals(like some form of magic). On the left wall would be a gorgeous tapestry of silky-white and red. On the left would be HALF OF THE BOOKSHELF of books she owned, she collected, and acquired in the last sixty years.Keep in mind that this is only half of that library, the other half would in the separate room behind her chair. Would be slit somewhat open so you could see the silver, gold, and other forms of enchanted items glowing. (Specifically this Mottnechite = Lava incased gemstone with Orange and Red highlights). The books themselves are likely older than her, some glowed in greens, whites, purples, blacks, and so on.[The Golden/Ruby room] -- Next room, to the right would be shimmering with a bright Ruby Red gemstone and a Golden circle. The door would be of a ghastly grey. Magical in form, this door wouldn\u2019t be operable to anyone except T\u2019J. Contains the high portion of her treasures and much, much, more.[Record Room] -- Dates back to the age of 19, when she first went upon a expedition. Several folders, files, catalogs, records, transcripts, treaties, accords, stamped papers written in traditional ink and feather pens. She goes to this room to make sure that all of the latest deals, and arrangements are kept. Officially and unofficially.[Her Resting Quarters] -- Basically T\u2019J\u2019s bathroom, dressing room, and bedroom. Further down the hallway, this room is locked with a mechanism that isn\u2019t found anywhere but the Isle she was from or moved away from that is. She owns several hundreds of dresses, heels, jewelry, tiara\u2019s, crowns, oils, makeup, you name it. A lady has it. (Okay back to what T\u2019J was doing LOL. -- You can start replaying after this sentence below, thank you!)Flipping away in a book she was reading, T\u2019J looks out the window, a palm under her chin.

There was a lot she stole, other which were hers, of course, T'Jarae wasn't one for lying. Some information she withheld unless it was from her shop. Though, Volk did want to know what was the oldest.Not with a mind sight on thumbing through her record book, she choose to go digging.\"Well, a scroll... there was that one time with that dagger... oh!\" It appeared that the Fey'Ri's icy blue eyes had found something. Turning on her heels from the 7th column on the left, least 12 rows down, was a box.A grey box with barely visible black lines. On the top was Jade pebbles written in what looked to be \"Willmaker\". The shine made the bold text stand out. T'J walked close to him with the intent of having Volk open the box himself.\"The 'Willmaker' given by its name from a oppressed terrorist. It was a gift for me in turn for favors that would be owed. That said, What is this? A single shot pistol, with enchanted gun power.\"T'J points to the rather beautiful ribbons of Jade that looped inside the box and out.\"God's willing, the man is not dead, so I can provide you a wholesome worth of his gunpower as he makes it himself... and still owes me until otherwise. So if there is someone you really, and  I mean, ABSOLUTELY despise. That pistol has the power to degenerate a person fatally with one shot alone. Lingering, disgusting and rather nice way.\" From her tone it would imply that T'J had used the weapon before.\"Not sure if you've encountered a plague in these parts yet, but if they breath, walk, run, have a heart, its long suffering. Was crafted before I was of the age of 16. Time has passed, and when you meet people, they can change, or kill you.\" Giggling, T'J thought it was good to add that sort of detail.", "link_list": ["/post/55659/thread", "/post/55636/thread", "/user/1745"], "image_list": ["//storage.proboards.com/6046952/images/uCQvKjMwQCSfGa7d4dCT.jpg", "//storage.proboards.com/6046952/avatar/nhnPwl0WzWrpL2q4fumP.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@haughty\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/55659/thread\" timestamp=\"1478534275\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-0\" title=\"haughty\"><img alt=\"haughty Avatar\" src=\"//storage.proboards.com/6046952/images/uCQvKjMwQCSfGa7d4dCT.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/55659/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1478534275000\" title=\"Nov 7, 2016 7:57:55 GMT -8\">Nov 7, 2016 7:57:55 GMT -8</abbr></a>  @haughty said:</div><div author=\"@frieza137\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/55636/thread\" timestamp=\"1478494457\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-1745\" title=\"T'jarae N.
