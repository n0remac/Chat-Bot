A steady supply of fresh air from the surface was pumped down using a mechanical system comprised of a water wheel that automatically operated a large set of bellows; meaning the people who worked down there did not have to suffer so much from claustrophobia. However, the mines themselves could be dangerous despite their general level of comfort. Pitfalls, the possibility of cave-ins, the occasional creature that finds its way up from the depths and threatens to drag a miner back down with it - they made for an uneasy atmosphere shared by men and women who had only been there for a few weeks. Hardly enough time to be at home, or fully explore. The name of the mine came from the system of bells placed in the tunnels. Depending on the severity of the ringing and how many times it was tolled, the bell echo would travel through the tunnels and communicate danger, a call for help or even just to check in and let people know they weren't in trouble. One day, however, a bell at one of the lowest parts of the mine wasn't rung. This was highly unusual because that specific area of the mine was known for pits, holes and nasty crags one could injure themselves in, meaning that the miners working down there were required to ring their bell at least once an hour in a specific fashion - else the guards would proceed with the expectation of a rescue mission. So when the bell remained silent, a squad of four guards packed rope and medical supplies into a pack and began a march down the torch-lit tunnels, expecting the miners on duty to have either missed their time-slot or knocked themselves out by slipping; or something equally unexciting.However, the squad of guards never rang the bell to communicate a safe arrival. Nor did they ring to communicate a call for further aid, or a false alarm. They simply went silent, lost in the dark of the mines. With up to six men now missing, the remaining guards stationed at the mine decided to block the passage up with wood and crates as a security measure, then evacuate the miners to the more open and populated areas of the construction for roll call and protection.They found several more missing. Miners who never turned up; men and soldiers who had gone missing in the past several days that no-one had even noticed gone until such a time they were all required to stand in the same room at once.\"Something here is seriously wrong,\" the head warden said, as he sent a messenger down the mountains and towards the Citadel. \"Tell them to send help.

As for the glaives, they were not so kind. As the blade swung under the Volkrim, they would slide their left hand closer to the blade. Using the momentum, plus a little extra strength, they'd brind the end of the glaive that had an iron ball on it to keep their hands from slinding off directly into the side of the Volkrim snouts. As the ball hit, they would continue with their momentum, swinging this time for their guts. If the Volkrim tried to lower or raise, it was nothing but a wrist movement to redirect this momentum. Pouncing was ultimately a bad decision to do on a group of ranged weapons. Although the Volkrim did kill some, they would lose twice as many.

Their mass was susceptible to the momentum they'd carry with each strike.In this combat, the swords and shields seemed to be trying to encircle them. What was standing in the middle was trying to conufuse the Volkrim while thethe others were circling around them. If the Volkrim weren't paying much attention, they'd become encircled quickly by the wormy movements of the Grand Army soldiers. As a bonus, what galives still stood were taking outside positions, poking and swinging at the Volkrim, almost like they were trying to coral them while the shields did their part.

They knew that they could go on so much more, so taking out the encircled Volkrim was their best choice.As the Grand Army soldiers on the ground began to launch their final assault on the encircled Volkrim, both sides began to drop from a tide of arrows. One of two glaives still standing would take his position as standing officer and decide what to do. There wasn't much they could do but take down the Volkrim and fall back.When the hand took hold of the neck, it would continue it's forward motion. What would follow this motion was a choke slam. Sinn put as much power in his arm as he could to plant the giant wolf man on his back. The moment that Owa's sword would reach hit arm pit, Owa's back would meet the frozen ground. With what adrenaline was rushing, the minor bit of damage the blade caused would be overlooked. Sinn would raised his left arm and his shield. He would bring it down on the side of Owa's head. His intention was to beat on the beasts head while cutting off his air. He knew if he could hold off for a few more seconds, Owa would pass out. He was always ready to kill him, but he knew he needed Owa as a prisoner, and the only way to do that is knock him out.In the midst of Sinn's assault, he would reply to Ildesias without missing a beat, \"My Basilisk is right below the surface. I've got a plan and i'm doing it regardless. Have your men fall in with mine and form a wall of shield towards the sky.\"The Grand General turned to his men, \"SKY WALL! Join ranks with the Free City and fall back!\"The black energy surrounding Sinn's hands would pulse one. The pulse would act as though Owa was punch in the throat. Towards the battlefield the ground would rumble and growl. The ground frozen ground would begin to split. After a few seconds, an explosion of rock, ice, and snow would happen.The explosion occurred in the midst of the battle with the Free City and the beastmen. The mighty beast was a twenty-two feet long, black scaled, silver exoskeleton, Desert Basilisk. It's body was designed to grind through the ground for tunneling, it's exoskeleton was stronger than most armor. It would begin to snap up enemy soldiers and sling them into the air after chomping them with it's razor sharp teeth. Those that got caught looking dead into the basilisks eyes would find themselves dead immediately, holding up to the reason why it was a basilisk. Sinn did not want to involve the basilisk unless he had to. For the survival of some, it was needed. This was the whole reason he was drawing magic. He had fully bonded with the basilisk, his strength growing to match the basilisks, while the basilisk matched Sinn's intelligence. The next step to this bond would be bad for everyone, even his own, if he was pushed to it. He was hoping this battle could hold it's own and the united retreat could happen. As long as one man from the Free City lived, he would hold back from the next step. He wouldn't let anyone get any glory for defeating a company from Grand Army, and he didn't consider retreat a defeat, but more of a chance to even the odds.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "As Mariah took off, two archers would fire to try and down her.

He had once served a mighty Elfin kingdom, many summers ago, and such a beast had been unleashed upon them. He was quite aware how deadly it could be and was extremely relieved it wasn't an enemy.As the remaining 20-30 Free City soldiers gathered around Ildesias, they formed a wall and ceiling of shields as best they could and braced themselves against the raining arrows. They were still taking losses, but soon they were able to slowly pull back down towards the pass.\"Just a little longer!\" He yelled, before peering out through the spaces of one of the shields and looking up towards the mountain on the flank of the pass. He saw a figure up there, but could not make much out other than that it was doing something. Before long, he saw the flash of magic and the rumbling of snow. Had it started? Had someone else beaten him to his plan?But more than that, it was the enemy. Which meant that it was specifically designed to work against them... Something he could not afford, not after such a difficult encounter.\"Break!\"The shields opened up for him suddenly, and he took the spell that had charged in his hand and threw it up into the sky. Several hundred feet above the battle, the orb began to hover and levitate; taking a coloured form as bright as snow before expanding in a mighty shockwave. This shock hit the sides of the mountains, capable of not only knocking over the griffon-riding archers, but also of disturbing the entire area around them. Specifically - the snow.Within seconds, it began to crumble and fall. A wall of tumbling snow that grew with every passing moment until the pass was like a bowl into which water was being poured.\u00a0\"Run!\"Ildesias turned, as did his remaining men, and fell back towards the pass opening in a sprint.
