His eyes affix on Aechon and the child's condition brings a grim look to his face. The grimness lasts only for a moment though. He quickly replaces it with a gentle smile. The smile is a bit forced, but there is a genuine warmth in the paladins eyes. He crouches down next to the child and says kindly.\"Hey there little soldier.

Can you do that while I work?\"Jayce would wait for the child to nod in the affirmative. He was not a skilled healer and the child's injuries were quite server. Fortunately you could make up for a lack of skill with sufficient power. Placing a hand over the child's eyes and another on his stomach, Jayce summons the Seraphim's seal. There is a pulse of holy magic as it manifest's, it would call to the souls of the two angelic beings. It speaks of the celestial realm of the absolute love the light provided. Their worries and ills would be soothed at least for a time. As Jayce works he would talk to the child of small things.\"What is your name? What games do you like to play? Where your favorite places to play?\"He would steer the child's thoughts to happy places. Avoiding topics that might upset him, such as where his parents maybe.
