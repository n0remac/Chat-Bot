From the streets, she knows everything that goes unnoticed under the guards noses. One of those things is a new drug making it's rounds. Dart isn't one for partaking of drugs but she also believes in the firm saying \"don't knock it tell you try it.\" She's been told that those who sell always have a way of finding those that are looking. Just by the sound of this stuff, it doesn't seem too bad. Not the first time she's thinking about drinking something that might kill her. The city have all gone to bed at this dark hour. Dart begins roaming the cobblestone streets. It's glorious how empty everything is after the sun falls.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.pinimg.com/originals/53/77/67/537767b3e32b71e548a2d98014351b52.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/53/77/67/537767b3e32b71e548a2d98014351b52.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}, "post-94632": {"user": "Storyteller", "user_num": 3343, "timestamp": "1579057084000", "message": "\"You look as though you want something.\" The voice comes from just above Dart's head and behind her, there was a wall that acted as a buttress for a ramp and sitting upon it was a young man. Had he been there when she'd just walked by a moment ago? It was hard to say it was dark out but surely she would have noticed someone sitting balanced on that incline. He was fairly unremarkable. Wearing a leather hunting vest over a plain white tunic, he had what looked to be a short hunting bow slipped over his shoulder, and a hunting knife attached to his belt. He had short-cropped auburn hair, a pale but clear complexion, and sharp angular features. She might have thought him some hunter in from the wilds except for his eyes. They were... flat, dull, and a tad frightening.Reaching into a pouch he pulls out a vial of blue powder. \"This is what you are looking for?\" If what Dart had heard on the street was true, it almost certainly was. Blue Blood, the drug that promised euphoria and power, the drug that made you glow. No one knew where it came from but it was cheap and all who tried it couldn't wait for more.

The thought of something that'll make Dart quicker or stronger or whatever makes her eyes glow with delight. Maybe she can mix the powder with a drink and chug it down or maybe that might not be such a great plan. \"you don't look like the usual types that live around Isra\" Dart remarks wondering if he too is taking the drug.
