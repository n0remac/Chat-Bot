Upon further examination you see that the entrance to the cave is near impossible to reach, a one foot ledge leads along to a six foot balcony that juts out of the mouth of the cave. When you finally get a look inside you see many stalagmites and stalactites lining the walls as if a large beast has destroyed the center ones. The cave also extends deeper out of sight. As you try to climb up and explore further a soft heartbeat, which had been playing in the background, now stopped and you can hear your own heartbeat. Perhaps it is now time to leave as you spot two yellow eyes appear out of the darkness and they track you.Lair layout: The central entrance or the main hall is the largest of the 4 rooms and contains the only way in. The room's height is great, as it extends almost 70 feet up into the top of the mountain. The walls and stones are lined with a metallic-like substance that appears to conduct electricity your hair stands up on edge as you get too close. At the far end holds and recently caved in pathway. From what you can tell it collapse fairly recently, not any more than 20 years ago.To the far back left is an entrance to a room similar to the main hall but is smaller and the walls are decorated with many different scriptures and designed of a language that you have never seen before. Some of these runes or symbols teem with mana and energy, obviously used for magic of some sort.To the central right opens up to a medium sized cavern with shelves that could possibly have stuff put on them, but the most noticeable part is that the floor curves down into the floor creating a bowl like area in the center. Inside this bowl is a strange mix of broken branches, sticks, and young trees all ground into a sort of mulch or bedding. Also within the bowl contains a fair amount of gold coins and other shinning object mixed into the compressed mulch.The third room (if you are ever able to see it) is adjacent to the bed-like room and in the center is one of the largest piles of wealth you will ever see. Stacked at least 6 feet tall is gold, jewels, gems, weapons of varying types, materials, and sizes. At the top lays a single Sapphire, and one could see within the beauty of the object why this dragon would possess it. The room swirls with mana and electricity through the walls.Unique Loot in Hoard:Giantcutter, an ornate scythe engraved with runes of power. It was taken from the hoard of the dragon Sumana.Fiendhammer, an ornate mace set with pearl. It was taken from the Sanctum of Emirkol the Chaotic.Stonereaver, a legendary longsword said to have been created to slay the Dragon of Cusebai and later was stolen from the warrior's child who inherited it.The Arcane Shards of Zaghat, a set of scrolls contained in a lacquered oak box. It is said to be haunted by the ghost of the illustrious mage Zaghat, leader of the Dragons of Barazig.Heartspear, a mythical spear which was taken from the hoard of the dragon Nabura.The Empyrean Enchiridion of Sudri, a modest book bound in leather with copper hinges and fittings. It is said to be sought by the dragon Saamsadea whom was Jarkoopi's father's nemesis.Fell Storm, a legendary war axe said to lead the one who wields it to wealth and glory.Gianttooth, a magical longbow inlaid with ruby, joint crafted by elves and humans alike. It is said to be imbued with the spirit of the human ranger Enbulf, who fell in the Darastrix Hunt Campaign. It's magical design helps it split dragon scale as if it were air.Map of lair:Exact location is: Central Kingdom of Medan Goraia, and East of the mountain range and the mountain pass.Effects in location:Below Average Oxygen level (you tire out easily unless you are adapted to lower oxygen levels, also slightly harder to create a flame)Chilly (while not cold or snowy, one with incorrect or lack or protection would suffer minor hypothermia and lose stamina)Magical (mana is present in the surroundings giving all magic users a small bonus)Dim (light still reaches the interior of the cave but is not bright enough to prevent effective sneaking)Conductive (the surroundings conduct electricity easily)", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/c7qKp3Q.jpg", "http://imgur.com/H0RagYX.png"], "html": "<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/c7qKp3Q.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/>"}, "post-1281": {"user": "Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui", "user_num": 102, "timestamp": "1428002877000", "message": "Jarkoopi paced around his caverns occasionally knocking down or walking through one of his ancient stalagmites.

It was a rather large cave entrance, and there were many fulgurites in the area, suggesting a great deal of electrical activity. The cave itself smelled like ozone. It was oddly invigorating. Jun felt like a child sneaking out of the house when she peeked into the cave entrance, where she could just make out the sounds of snoring.It's asleep...It's asleep.IT'S ASLEEP!! \"It's asleep!\" She whispered to Camilla and Jill. She thought about how they should best approach this. \"Ok, here's the deal. I have a spell which can make a creature go out of phase, and therefor invisible, for a few seconds. That might be enough time to gather the layout of the lair. Now, Camilla has the same spell sealed in one of her scrolls, but it's not that strong and might last 15 seconds, since I made it a while ago and I've been practicing since then. I can cast a stronger one on one of you, which might last 40 seconds, but it'll cost me more mana.\"Jun thought for a moment.\"Or we can just ambush it, me and Jill, with all the magic we've got, or maybe sneak past it? It IS asleep. But then again we can also wake it up and try to talk to it. So, we've got options. What do you guys think?\"***Just to review, among the choices Jun is offering, Choice A is to have Camilla use her phase scroll and move on to choice B, or just skip to choice B. Choice B is to either wake up the dragon (diplomacy will probably be a big deal), ambush the dragon (combat is everything), or scout further with Jun's spell (athleticism, and stealth if the spell wears off). The consequences of the actions aren't fixed. For example, someone might decide they found the gem and from there try to steal it after the spell wears off with their own stealth ability. Or they could chicken out and try to sneak back and regroup. So basically the choices might lead to a third choice, Choice C.The idea behind mana is that Jun can do whatever the party asks, but will have less to bring to a fight if there is one. So the more stealth we do, the less fighting Jun will be able to do.And of course, Jill and Camilla can offer their own options.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["//storage.proboards.com/6046952/images/5AgYdAfn8rATue75bHkc.png"], "html": "<Enter from the Usque>"}, "post-2616": {"user": "Trogdor", "user_num": 145, "timestamp": "1431668301000", "message": "Squawks, \"Go back!\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_0YOjaotiavQ/TMMQsFFcYlI/AAAAAAAALC0/rQwyIWwJYv0/s1600/Raven4.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_0YOjaotiavQ/TMMQsFFcYlI/AAAAAAAALC0/rQwyIWwJYv0/s1600/Raven4.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}, "post-2618": {"user": "Jun of the Celadine", "user_num": 108, "timestamp": "1431672543000", "message": "\"...

By feeling the flow of magic through the cave walls, he could tell that the creature outside was attempting to match his power, while normally it was custom to only allow the hosting dragon to use spells or magic within their private lair, he doubted this being was a dragon whom knew the ancient customs. He quit channelling any extra magic through his hide, he let the surrounding aura of magic flow in and out of his being.Grandma, he had heard of and seen, but never once truly managed to learn anything more than the outside. He did know for sure that Grandma was indeed, definitely not human. Something much darker and likely immortal, a demon of sorts. The study of the dark arts and it\u2019s realms was one of Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui\u2019s weakest fields of magic, as he saw dark evil magic to only ever to be used to fight the greatest power of good, when the scales of balance were tipped. As Grandma starts her address, the shifting of scales could faintly be heard from the back of the cave, likely Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui sitting up to listen.Isra, always looking to interfere with someone or something to enhance themselves. The primary population appeared to the dragon as snobby, spoiled, brats who always thought that their path is the only and righteous path.So far what she was saying was mostly already known to him, he was indeed one of the head leaders  towards the end of the war, but his policies and actions were his own, he didn\u2019t completely follow or agree with the Goraian regime. Of course the unintelligent mortals would simply reach to the one of greatest potential power to blame, this sort of mistrust from Isra was not new, it was part of the reason why he resigned from the Isranian government. He challenged the evil control of his Goraian comrades, trying to enforce a much more modest government or form of their own, only to receive all the blame for his associates\u2019 actions, typical.The last phrase caught his attention, as it could be heard that the dragon rapidly got on his feet. He kept a single eye locked on his treasure room. Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui looked to make sure it was still there. It was.He had heard that Grandma had removed herself from her position from Isra\u2019s government, how could he trust her then? Unless perhaps it was all made up to allow Grandma to appear to be operating discreetly and independently, separate from Isra\u2019s morals and regulations? He didn't know enough to either trust or not trust Grandma. But he was certain he wasn't soon going to hand over the gem to Isra for them to abuse or destroy one of the sacred stones of natural balance. What are they hoping to gain? And what made her so sure that the blame on him would so easily and quickly disappear once he handed the Sapphire over? He'd need more information.Still echoing from the rear of the cave, the dragon's voice spoke up.\u201cYes, I've quite realized by now that I do not have quite a favorable opinion by the general people. While I am willing to try and make peace with the state of Isra, I cannot simply hand over such an artifact with at least inquiring, what are you going to do with it? The gem has been safe under my watch for more than 52 years now, and I have no intention to recklessly trade this magical stone for the mere opinion of the underlings of a city, which I helped create. I've lived long enough to see plenty of these foolish trades happen.\u201dThe dragon huffed, clearly not please about how rash Grandma was being.

Why was it so secret of its use? Were they planning something so evil or good that would forever disturb the scales of alignment? It didn't add up in the dragon's mind, even with Empress Naoki\u2019s written word he refused to trust them wholly. The offer of neutrality was tempting though.Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui stepped over to his hoard to scoop up the single sapphire gem while pushing the gold coins and trinkets aside. He inspected it, his deep yellow eye gazing into the endless abyss of blue. It's power waved through his arm, and the precious stones looked back at him wearily.Could it be Soreth? No, he died hundreds of years ago on Darastrix. Whoever it was, he was chosen to protect their spirit, and he would not leave the gem alone with anyone but his most trusted allies.\u201cI am bound by honor and ancient tradition to protect this gem. If you want it, I'll have to accompany it wherever it may go.\u201dHe said, the dragon's deep low words thundering through the cavern complex.She wanted to offer him a piece of paper and words to rule over a magical stone of great power? Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui grasped the gem firmly in his claws as to not lose grip but gentle enough not to risk damaging its beautiful surface. Finally the dragon made his way to tell entrance of the cave to face Grandma. Thumping towards the entrance, it could be seen that the storm dragon wore no armor or gear at the moment, and if one were to get close, there were minor scars and deformities visible, but were almost all healed. His body occupied most of the cave entrance, he must've grown, or his lair shrunk. Grandma might also notice the dragon's clenched claw and the power resonating behind it. It was her guess as to what it could be.He stood tall and blocked the entrance from Grandma before continuing to respond.\u201cYour paper ultimately means nothing, for it is nothing but a sheet of words that have no voice or power. I wish to give you the gem for your offer, but I cannot unless it is kept with me and there is a definite guarantee that neither of us can easily turn against our word.

After about a minute of meticulous writing, the old woman turns her attention back to Jarkoopi, the contract before her completed. Motioning with her hand, Grandma sends the contract floating towards Jarkoopi, upon which, he will find the following written.Once relinquishing ownership of the artifact to Isra...Jarkoopi Kepesk Altiui shall be granted a single pardon of all previous crimes committed against The Free States. His home at Mt. Indra shall not be disturbed by any Isran forces and nothing will be constructed on land within four miles of it. Jarkoopi Kepesk Altiui shall be allowed to the city of Isra without reprisal on the condition he is in his human form. This right is voided if Jarkoopi Kepesk Altiui commits a crime that warrants him being jailed. Isra shall allow Jarkoopi Kepesk Altiui to be present near the water gem whenever he wishes. Jarkoopi Kepesk Altiui shall not speak of this contract to anyone outside of Grandma or The High Lady Naoki and must not speak of the gem to anyone else.Those who sign this contract shall be compelled to follow it.\u201cIf you find such a contract satisfactory, I can assure you that Lady Naoki would be willing to sign it. This is the best I can offer you in terms of Isra following through with their promise to pardon you. You have seen me write the contract before you and know it to be genuine. Lady Naoki\u2019s word is the law of Isra. If she were to sign this, you know that her orders would be followed.\u201dHe was glad to see that Grandma was willing to come through on the strength of how such a deal will be followed. From the darkness down the hall, the dragon allowed her to craft a newer contract from the mysterious quill and ink.Pleased to notice to presence of a magically bound contract being made for his own personal concern, when the magically infused text flew down the cavern he read it with great care, his yellow reptilian eyes glancing upon it as if it were trying to steal gold from him, as to make sure he knew everything that would have to be followed by both sides.While he did feel this was still rather pitted against him, he found it satisfactory enough for his liking.\u201cVery well, I will agree to these terms, and these terms alone. If I know my magics from many years ago, I\u2019m assuming my \u2018signature\u2019 will require some sort of blood oath or bond? I can provide, if that is the case.\u201dHe would keep the gem visibly hidden in his hand until both parties signed their respective areas.", "link_list": ["/post/67665/thread", "/user/602", "/user/102", "/user/602"], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/Dj6XdBO.png"], "html": "<div author=\"@grandma\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/67665/thread\" timestamp=\"1495484921\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-602\" title=\"Grandma\"><img alt=\"Grandma Avatar\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Dj6XdBO.png\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/67665/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1495484921000\" title=\"May 22, 2017 12:28:41 GMT -8\">May 22, 2017 12:28:41 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-602 group-0\" href=\"/user/602\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@grandma\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Grandma</span></a></span> said:</div>\u201cThat is true, this paper has no power in it.

Was his thousand year old word not trustworthy enough? He was one for tricks and illusions, but never a lie. Nevertheless, he kept silent as the agent of Isra disappeared. The dragon would sleep for a couple days, resting and gathering energy to forge an accessory from his newly acquired tool. When he woke, he immediately went to begin chipping stone slabs from the interior of his cave. At last he had the perfect length stone, it could fully wrap around his wrist and not hinder his movement. With dragonfire, he cooked the stone to a hot temperature so he could bend it, but it would not melt. Smoke bellowed out from the lair entrance and rose to the sky. He bent the red hot stone around his right forearm, then began heating the joint of the slab, which would also burn himself, but dragons are mostly resistant to dragonfire and the wounds could be healed by magic. The dragon used his claw to dig out a half spherical hole where the gem would rest. He set the pale blue rock in the center of the hole, then began superheating it's socket. The molten stone would harden against the gem, locking it in place. It was a crude piece for now, he could fancy it up later.
