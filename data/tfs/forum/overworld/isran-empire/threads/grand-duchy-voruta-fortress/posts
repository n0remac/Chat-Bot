Even though it was a stormy day, the city was bustling, though not with the usual signs of a market day. The sounds of clanging hammers on metal, the smell of blacksmith's furnaces, and the cursing of masters to their apprentices filled the working quarters of the city. War horses were being moved into stables, or walked in circles by their riders to loosen up there muscles, to keep them from growing soft. Heavily muscled and scarred men lounged around in the taverns, playing card and dice games out of boredom, getting in arguments over supposedly loaded dice and dealing from the bottom of the deck. But, beyond their boredom, their anxiousness was palpable, their restlessness filling the city with the same energy. A few less than polite comments came from those men lounging in door ways or on covered steps, saying how the mares would make great breeders for their horses, and that extended to Lady Hepburn as well, followed by rowdy jeers and clanking of mugs of ale.\u00a0Their arrival was made known to the castle as they approached, causing the staff to scurry to prepare for the unexpected guests. Retainer infantry, wearing the green of the Gediminas house, watched the approaching knight brothers with apprehension, resting their hands on their weapons. The gates were already opened for the day, to allow the movement of supplies from the town below to the citadel. Two heavily armored men resting their weight on their spears, wearing green capes over their hunched shoulders, asked the arrivals first in their harsh native tongue, then in heavily accented Isran, \"Koks yra j\u016bs\u0173 verslas \u010dia?

Turning to Bloise, he ordered, \"Send word to Vyatautas, even if his leg is still broken, we need his men,\" then briskly exited the room, leaving the wizard to his own devices. Walking down the stairs to get to the main hall, he yelled to a page, \"Send word to the city, tell them to be prepared to move when we are joined by Vyatautas' men! And make sure notices are placed in all the taverns for any and all adventurers!\"\"My lord, there are strangers at the gate. They aren't Israns,\" said another page, appearing from a side corridor.\"Well, whoever they are, tell them they need to make it quick, we have a war to fight!\" Yelled back Gediminas, as he finally found his way to the hall. It was a great stone room with tall vaunted ceilings held up by pillars. It was sparsely decorated, though that could be fixed easily by the hauling in of large tables for feasts. A dais sat opposite the main door with three thrones of varying height. The tallest was filled with a portrait of the Empress Naoki, and the second tallest was Gediminas' seat, with the third being Vyatautas.

Eventually they would begin their ascent to the wooden gate to the citadel, and the poor guards. Despite the inordinate heat armor provided in the sun and in the midst of battle, it did nothing to retain it during the cold. So approaching they would find two shivering guards bundled up in green cloaks and thick furs, attempting to pass the time by throwing dice on a blanket and gambling with their nonexistent wages, having already gambled this month's some time ago. This was supposed to be the quiet time of year with little to no visitors, which made guard duty all that much more of a burden.\"Kurwa!\" cursed one guard as it looked like he lost yet another chance of a visit to the alehouse, before looking up to the riders. There was a woolen scarf covering most of his face, but his eyes clearly spoke their confusion, \"Kas po velni\u0173 tu?\" He asked in Vorutan, grabbing his bardiche from where it rested against the wooden door.

While normally the four long tables for meals would be in the center of the hall floor, tonight they were all much closer to the hearth, with the head of the tables having the quite enviable position of not being too close nor too far to the roaring blaze. While the company appeared to be mostly nobility in rich clothing and some jewelry about themselves, there were definitely elements that didn't fit. A long haired, nearly bald man in a blue robe sat in the most unenviable position closest to the fire sprang to mind as being the most obvious. Another was seated at the left hand of what appeared to be the man in charge, wearing rather dour clothing... not too dissimilar from Dietrich's in fact. There was something of a feast happening tonight, and the raucous nature of the assembled guests clearly reflected that there had been more than a few cups of mead, schnapps, vodka, ale, whatever their particular poison was liberally applied to every guest. Even at the arrival of another, very few seemed to take notice aside from a quick look over their shoulders. All aside from the guest of honor and the man at his side.
