It wasn't at all fond of the name, but beyond these walls were its targets; the witchers! This morning where the dew had placed itself heavily on the plants and trees, Petty had decided that these infamous humans would be the victims of his next great evil deed!Petty slithered closer to the large wooden door, and by using his flickering tongue, he determined that the door unfortunately had no obvious cracks he could creep through. In a fit of anger and driven by an insatiable will to do evil, the creature stood on its back legs towering an incredible 30 cm above the ground, and pounded its front legs on the gate. \"Whiiiicheeers! Come out!\" he commanded with his shrieking and horse snake voice. But both the pounding and yelling would be very difficult to hear for anyone - even if they stood right behind the massive gate. But a monster of Petty's like would not have himself being ignored and with great persistence he would continue! Well at least until he would start to feel tired, after which he might consider going elsewhere for the time being. After all there were so much evil to be done in this world!", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Through the mossy trees and the high grass the snake slithered as it flicked it's tongue to figure out the right direction.
