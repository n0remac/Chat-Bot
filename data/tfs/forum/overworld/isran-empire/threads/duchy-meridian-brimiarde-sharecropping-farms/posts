The cavalry were hopefully scattered by the dragons attack, and their was no resistance between the woods and Lamina, so it should have been a quick grab-n-go kidnapping. Should Lamina be captured by the Varan, they'd haul her off into the woods. When the battle ended, the Varan may ransom her off back to Gotaia for the right price...(Our records indicate Vald's entry was quite some time ago, and while it then became unsure of where his mercenaries were (Vald appeared to show up in New Brimiarde alone), the one thing certain is that after the invasion of New Brimiarde, packs of unidentified horsemen (that is, they do not know their \"rank or PN\") would not capable of running freely or in disguise in the region. These troops therefore could not exist, except perhaps on the farthest fringes of the New Brimiarde region, which would be much, much too far to suddenly intervene in time.)If they did attempt to intervene, it'd be towards a battle so far away they'd have a difficult time making out two females running, if they could even see that it was a battle at all. The farmhouse in question, from the closest distance from which one could observe without crossing into the numerous military checkpoints and patrols, would be but a speck in the distance.Mar 8, 2016 18:34:18 GMT -8 Keizhi said:Keizhi ran and ran.

She wanted more than anything to signal to them that she did not intend to fight. She had no means of actually fighting.much less against soldiers on horseback who outnumbered her.She felt a fear she had never felt before, as the look in her eyes begged for some semblance of mercy. Like Vald, she was somewhat of a third party and was not an indoctrinated member of the Resistance - just in the wrong place at the wrong time...Keizhi would not be killed, but shackled and taken prisoner.
