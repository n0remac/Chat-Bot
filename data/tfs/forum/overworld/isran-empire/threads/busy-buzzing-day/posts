When a bee reaches 20 years of age they are able to choose their own path. They can stay with the colony and continue working as a worker bee in hopes of getting promoted or they can leave the safety of the hive. Casey chose the latter option. It has been their dream to one day be skilled craft person when it came to fabrics. A person who people travel far and wide to see Casey's clothing, who said a bee had to be limited only to make bee sized clothes. Casey aimed much bigger and learned how to make clothes for any sized humanoid person. Armed with their trusty sewing table, a brown satchel, and a nifty sun hat they set out to chase their dream. There isn't exactly much about Casey except that they are a bee who measures up to 2ft (70cm) from wing to wing and 1ft (30cm) tall. No one really knew when and where these large bees started showing up within the world. One day they were just here and it was a bit alarming for common folks. People often have rumors about these large bees but the one that makes the most sense is some sort of wizardly mishap caused the enlargement of the bees and surrounding plant/wild life. The bees themselves don't even know why they're big. Ever since the first enlarged hive, any bee born from that hive were large as well. Slowly and surely these big bees flew and migrated across the land. Sure, small bees still exist but they are hard to come by now a days. Let's get back to Casey. Casey flies their way out into the field as her colony waves Casey goodbye hoping to find a nearby town where they can start their new lives. Their curious black eyes dart around at the vividness of the outside world. There is so much beauty and color in the outside world.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://www.gamepur.com/files/styles/max_width_770px/public/images/2019-08/Minecraft%20Bees_1.jpg?itok=y51zDscq"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.gamepur.com/files/styles/max_width_770px/public/images/2019-08/Minecraft%20Bees_1.jpg?itok=y51zDscq\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/>"}, "post-93252": {"user": "Penny", "user_num": 3597, "timestamp": "1568245356000", "message": "A smaller bee slipped out of the hive unnoticed, the only identification being the small brown pouch strapped to her waist.She hovered under a nearby tree for a mere moment, spotted Casey, then took off after the older bee.
