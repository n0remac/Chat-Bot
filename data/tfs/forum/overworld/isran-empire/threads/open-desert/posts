Some might have found the lack of discipline odd for a military force but the marshals weren't one, not in the formal sense anyway. One of the reasons regimental structure was practiced to provide a sense of order and cohesion to people who needed to maintain such a mental state under extreme stress. Essentially you needed soldiers to practice at being calm and orderly at all times so they are better at maintaining formation during the actual fighting. Marshals didn't have such requirements since if they were the type to crumble under pressure they wouldn't be marshals. They tended to either be so stoic they could stare down a dragon without flinching, or so crazy they'd smile in the same situation. This is why they were sent out into impossibly dangerous situations alone or in a small group and given nothing more than vague instructions.

Alden had their respect so that is why they made their attempt at standing at attention.

Evolution seemed to know that dark-shaded skin would only make them hotter. Their hooves were a bit wider, too, to help them travel over the sands, and they could go longer than other horses without needing water.Needless to stay, the horse, unencumbered by anything as it had thrown off the Sakandi-styled bags and most of its saddle save for a few blankets, had made it pretty far in the desert... and not in a direction that made any sense. The dunes in this area were less high than the hillocks found in the rest of the desert, and it had reached a flat expanse that was dotted occasionally with rock formations, thick sand still under hoof.And as it ran past the formations, it had even more of a reason to keep running.Desert jackals had slid out from the shadows -- it seemed each formation led into shallow dens -- and the sleek desert dogs let out bays of hunting, a whole pack of them going after the horse. They rarely saw such a feast in the desert, and it was obvious that they planned to take the horse down, regardless of the single, large predator they could also smell on the breeze.----------------------------Meanwhile, Safi had finished putting most of her things back into her bag when she heard the high-pierced screech above her head. She looked up into the sky, and she saw the large, winged figure coming closer. It had in one massive talon, a limp and dead sand snake and was no doubt coming to where Safi was located as there were plenty more bodies to pick from.
