His metal helmet, like the heavy cavalry in front of him, was off and hanging on the pommel of his saddle. His metal coif was lowered and a small bead of sweat glistened across his hairline. His large shield was also wrapped around the pommel of the saddle, it's strap underneath his helmet's so he could get it on first, and his long four-meter lance was clutched loosely in his left hand, as were the reigns, so his right hand was free. Raising his right hand, he raked the mailed hand through his thick dark brown hair in an attempt to wipe the sweat away. The odd individual strand of hair found itself caught in-between ring-links of the mail, pulling them out by the root. It was irritating, but Oskar learned to bloke such irritation out during his training. It was more important to keep the salty sweat from rolling down his face and stinging his eyes.Oskar probably should've been afraid of what was to come, some mysterious monstrosity jumping out of the forest and attacking woodsmen. That's the type of shite mother's told their children before bedtime to scare them into behaving and respecting the woods. But he wasn't afraid. If anything, he was eager. This was his chance to prove himself, and he looked forward to tacking and hunting this beast down. He prayed that it would be his lance driven through the beast's heart, giving the death blow. To Oskar's immediate right rode Aleksander, a recent \"friend\" of his. He was wearing his helmet and his lance and shield were both at the read.

His large shield was also wrapped around the pommel of the saddle, it's strap underneath his helmet's so he could get it on first, and his long four-meter lance was clutched loosely in his left hand, as were the reigns, so his right hand was free. Raising his right hand, he raked the mailed hand through his thick dark brown hair in an attempt to wipe the sweat away. The odd individual strand of hair found itself caught in-between ring-links of the mail, pulling them out by the root.

But, if it showed any signs of feeling any pain, it was overshadowed by its great rage as it lunged at one retainer and then the next. It usually missed, but on one unfortunate soul, all it took was one mighty swing of the Watcher's horns for the retainer to go flying, hitting his head against a tree, and breaking his neck with a sickening crinkle.\u00a0<br><br/>Other's were not so luckily when it came to the ponds either. One horse stepped into a particularly slick place of mud. A loud <i>CRACK</i>, and the pitiful scream of the horse echoed over the thudding of the\u00a0 hooves of the other riders, as its cannon bone snapped. Its rider was thrown into the pond, and sunk into its rather impressive depth, weighed down by his heavy armor. He didn't even have time to scream.<br/><br/>The Elder Vyatautas had held back from the swirling melee, his blood turning cold as he saw his own fate in the great green eyes of the Watcher. He heard his own knell in the great bellows of the beast, felt his own soul shake with every pounding of the creature's hooves. Then his blood turned even colder.

Oskar sucked in a breath and closed his eyes, not wanting to see his lord\u2019s fate, and he started moving again, urging his gelding out of the gods-forsaken mud. When this is all said and done, he\u2019d have to spend extra time washing his poor gelding\u2019s hooves, to remove the amount of mud from its white socks. Not the most pressing matter currently, or a priority, but Oskar felt that thinking about something calming in the future, helped him tune out the death and fear around him presently.His horse finally managed to step out of the mud without breaking an ankle, and Oskar began his approach towards the creature. He slung his bow back across the rear of his saddle and pulled up his lance. The time for skirmishing was at an end. Unfortunately, due to the mud having slowed him down, the Elder Vyatautas had passed him and would get the first charge in, right in harm's way.Gritting his teeth, Oskar couched the lance expertly and began his own charge, his heart pounding in his chest. \u201cFOR VORUTA!\u201d He screamed.___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Where Oskar was an expert in melee, Aleksander was the opposite; quite skilled skirmishing from horseback, and arguably a better rider than his friend. He had spent the battle up to this point circling around the beast, adeptly maneuvering his horse around the few ponds while constantly firing arrows from his bow, each nearly always striking his target.Soon, Aleksander\u2019s quiver was nearly empty, and he\u2019d have to change up his tactics. However, he resolved to do that anyway, as he witnessed his young lord thrown to the ground by the mighty beast. Casting a quick glance down the small clearing, he spotted the Elder Vyatautas, followed by Oskar, charging the beast, and decided to swoop in for the rescue.Gulping, Aleksander spurred his horse in the Younger Vyatautas\u2019 direction, casting side-long glances at the beast to make sure its attention remained on the two charging men. As he got closed, he pulled his feet out of the stirrups, slung one leg over his saddle, and briefly rode side-saddle so he could dismount quickly when he arrived. And he had, once his horse passed the Younger Vyatautas, he jumped off his horse, his on legs rapidly moving in short steps to keep his balance, and ran to his Lord\u2019s side, trusting his horse to stop. He had trained it to stop moving once it\u2019s rider dismounted just for scenarios like this. However, this would be the first time in actual combat and Aleksander couldn\u2019t be certain his horse wouldn\u2019t get spooked by the bull and run off anyway.\u201cSire!\u201d Aleksander called out as he drove his lance into the soft dirt underneath the horse, mere inches beside his Lord\u2019s leg. \u201cI\u2019ll lift, and you\u2019ll crawl out, if you can.\u201d He kept his eyes peeled on the mighty creature as it turned to attack the Elder Vyatautas, making sure it didn\u2019t return and attack him. His conscious battled on whether or not he\u2019d be able to hold his ground and die next to his lord, or flee like a coward. He liked to think the first, but it was likely he\u2019d throw the lance down and run to his horse.Shaking his head, Aleksander heaved on the lance. The wooden lance worryingly began to bend in the middle, and Aleksander prayed to all the Gods that the horse would be lifted enough for the Younger Vyatautas to crawl out before the pole snapped like a twig\u2026___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\u201cNOOO!\u201d Cried out Oskar when his elder lord was skewered on the Watcher's large horns. He spurred his own horse faster his mouth a thin line of determination and his eyes narrowed, on target. While it was focused on the man on its horns, Oskar quickly closed the distance with his swift gelding, holding onto his lance tightly with his sweaty palms.He flexed his legs a little to stand him up slightly in the saddle, and rammed his lance into the creature\u2019s shoulder, trying to drive it down into its heart for the killing blow. The force of the blow and the speed he was passing caused the lance to break nearly in half, and he lost his grip on it. Four feet of splintered wood careened away while a foot of it jutted out of the Watcher\u2019s bloodied fur, telling Oskar a good two feet drove into its body. I hope that\u2019s enough,\u00a0was his thoughts as he tried to maneuver his horse out of the way in case the Watcher didn\u2019t die and retaliated.Oskar\u2019s shoulder had popped when the lance was wrenched out of his, and his whole right arm grew sore. He didn\u2019t believe anything was broken or dislocated, the pain wasn\u2019t that\u00a0bad, but he\u2019d be sore for a couple days.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Oskar watched the death and mayhem in horror, eyes wide and mouth slightly ajar.

The fact that Rudiger hasn\u2019t been to his homeland in years, for example, is fairly significant and should be rectified before his coronation. To this end, Empress Naoki has decided that the two of them will tour Voruta on foot in order to best acquaint themselves with the territory and the issues facing its people.She thinks it will be a productive trip. As Duke, Rudiger will be expected to improve Voruta, but the manners in which he does so will ultimately be his decision. By discussing what they see and what he might do about it as Duke, Naoki will be able to get a glimpse into how he thinks and correct him if he goes too far astray. She thinks herself to have a great deal of wisdom as far as ruling and policymaking is concerned, and this ought to be an excellent way to impart it on her newest vassal.Looking out across the field they now find themselves at the edge of, Naoki hums in consideration. She asked that they be placed just inside the Eastern Forest, such that they might approach from the east and see the obstacles that stand in the way of invaders. Off to their right, that would be The River Venta, and, if she\u2019s oriented herself correctly, Lake Plattelia and Voruta City should be some distance straight ahead. Of course, approaching this way means they run the risk of encountering said invaders, so Naoki doesn\u2019t loiter.

It\u2019s Naoki\u2019s hope that Rudiger will stop being a stranger in the course of this trip, but even so, measures have been taken in regard to her security.One such measure passes by overhead, briefly eclipsing the sun in order to make them aware of its presence \u2014 a Dawn Rider: one of Isra\u2019s elite griffin cavalry. Glancing up, Naoki spots three riders circling overhead, but she knows there are more.

It didn\u2019t help that vertigo with one eye was probably worst than with two, but he would just have to assume on that part. Despite the traveling conditions, he was rather looking forward to this trip. Perhaps as an excuse to quit the stifling capital and return to where he was most comfortable, the open road, and wearing plain traveling clothes. He would miss riding Bob about these old laneways and roads, seeing as this was his home too, but he assumed that they would find mounts soon enough. He couldn\u2019t imagine a possibility where they going to be afoot their entire time in the Duchy, seeing as horseflesh was one of the only highlights.Which was probably the best part of the bargain, being handed back his riding pants and linen shirt. Though he was shocked to see that they fit a bit tighter on him, perhaps from the too big of suppers with too many rich courses that were often served. Not that he was overweight by any means, he tended towards the leaner side from too many days scrounging for food while times were lean. IF anything it helped him fill out a bit more. He would have to convince his handlers to allow him to exercise more often still, He doubted the people of Voruta would be impressed with a fat Duke.Finally he gave the Empress his best estimation, \u201cI doubt the beasts will bother us with the griffins about, but the peasants probably will at least wonder why there\u2019s riders hanging from every branch it seems.\u201d ", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\u201cFrom beasts from the woods, or from commoners?\u201d Rudiger attempted to clarify after a few moments, his tone full of puzzlement.

He had something of a round gut, though it more was from drinking lots of ale than being a stranger to physical activity. His slightly curled light brown hair fell to his shoulders in the back, with a bald patch beginning to manifest on the back of his head. His hands were heavily calloused from swinging an axe, with a gold ring beset with the crossed axes of the lumberjack guild on the ring finger of his right hand. In the right hand, a steaming cup of black coffee.He took his time, sauntering up to the messenger, sipping on the cup with every few steps.

Even the biggest of fools would not try anything when all about them the most prestigious and capable members of the Imperial forces could swoop down upon them and carry them straight to prison... or down the gullets of their steeds, depending on who one talked to. \"Most peasants and brigands aren't idiots Your Empress,\" he replied softly, \"knowing from experience they know practical matters quite well, if not necessarily higher ones. They know that beast that can eat half their flock as an after thought is not one to unduly provoke.\"<br><br/>He had also been surveying the area they had been walking through, and remembering times when he and his older brother... well, adopted brother to be accurate... had hunted through these woods, looking to bring back fresh meat to the table. He could almost imagine a place where he had fallen off his little palfrey and broken his wrist, but the fades of his memory disappeared as soon as it seemed tangible. \"All things must change in time.\"<br/><br/>\"I would very much prefer riding on horse, and I would suggest the same for Your Empress. It would allow for a closer and more thorough studying of the situation, if a slower one,\" he answered. Perhaps he was being a bit presumptuous, but he remembered the flight over unknowable miles of land between here and the capital, all blending together.

People being used to the Dawn Riders in Voruta? He could see several issues with that statement, first and foremost being that the Dawn Riders very rarely ever ventured down to this neck of the woods, pun perhaps intended mentally, and when they did everyone was on high alert. Be it in the city or in the deep parts of the country.<br><br/>He was beginning to get an understanding of what the Vorutan ambassadors were constantly enumerating to him. Isran over lordship had its benefits to be sure, with access to selling goods in higher quantities to be sure and bringing in luxury products from the Empire. <br/><br/>But that very much did not capture the whole tale. Along with the luxuries came such a wave of cheaper items that home and cottage industries had been snuffed out from existence. There were several cases of Isran companies coming in and replacing Vorutan workers with their own help, exacerbating the poverty issue. The raids were just the final in many straws that would break the strongest stallion's back.<br/><br/>And perhaps the worst part of all of it, it seemed no one high enough in the Isran Bureaucracy cared. And Rudiger was beginning to suspect that as being more than the truth. No one he had approached in the government had given anything more than a glassy stare when he asked about certain conditions. He had been taught from a boy that the worst thing that someone could do was show complete apathy to your existence. Even if you disliked someone, you would still devote some energy that hate. But in apathy, you did not even offer that. Many in Voruta shared that same opinion.<br/><br/>It was the forgotten province, and in that blind spot bred frustration and resentment. The common talking points around the table in ale houses and on the roads often sounded much the same. If any other province in the Empire experienced half the issues that Voruta faced, then there would be parchment reports back to fill whole buildings. But how many could point to Voruta on the map, even as they built their homes out of her lumber, ate Vorutan rye bread with iron dug up from Vorutan soil. Iron that if they controlled they could use against those blasted orcs. But damned pieces of parchment secured them to fat cats who in the same breath as sending in Isran strike breakers to crack skulls would call the Vorutans the savages.\u00a0<br/><br/>Finally he answered, \"A mixture of all three Your Empress. I have not received much in the way of accurate reports in the capital, and I wish to be able to return when I am Duke with a full list of all that needs to be addressed. And I suppose... I suppose I wouldn't mind seeing my old home, to see my family. Even if we aren't blood related... they're still my family.\"<div class=\"quote_clear\"></div></br></div></div>\u201cMmmh, certainly,\u201d Naoki confirms, \u201cI\u2019d be pleased to meet them \u2014 if you\u2019d like.

Though she\u2019d like to see the look on Rudiger\u2019s mother\u2019s face, Naoki resolves to exercise discretion when the time comes. She wouldn\u2019t like to intrude.<br/><br/>They walk along for a bit before Naoki forms another thought: \u201cSeeing as how the whole \u2018incognito\u2019 bit doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s going to work out, we might consider changing our approach. Rather than trying to slink about and get a candid look at Vortuan life, what if we walked in just like this, hood down, and entertained conversations with the populace?\u201d A serious question, she\u2019s asking Rudiger how he\u2019d like to proceed.<br/><br/>\u201cYou\u2019re going to usher in a new age, and if you were to begin as such, riding about to see what problems you\u2019ll need to solve, that might garner you some support. You\u2019re not going to be able to fix their problems today, but if the new duke comes, listens to your problem, makes a note of it, and then has it resolved not too long after, that particular individual will have every reason to support you and your reputation will start off on a good note.\u201d<br/><br/><div class=\"quote_clear\"></div></div></div>"}, "post-92823": {"user": "Empress Naoki", "user_num": 607, "timestamp": "1564704041000", "message": "Jul 31, 2019 18:44:14 GMT -8 Rudiger Dornmauer said:\"I'd sooner deny a bear a feast than to make the acquaintance between you and my mother,\" Rudiger retorted to Naoki, a rare joke from him considering how terrified he was of her position.

The gods themselves were created from the spirit of life, which the nature of is... beyond explaining for our purposes, suffice it to say that if you ask two priests there would be three opinions on the subject.

We won't cover demons and where they come from.\"\"The heavens were peaceful, a paradise of no want or need. But being the bloodline of Vorutans, that did not suit the horsemen. They quarreled with themselves, the gods, and in some less than favorable accounts from rival priests of particular horsemen, the animals of the heavens. In short, they loved mayhem and would seek to create it where ever they could. As the gods preferred the peaceful order they created, they cast out the horsemen from the gates of heaven and onto the mortal plains to roam free. Which they did in short order.\"\"As I'm sure you are aware Your Highness, the world of then was much different then with no great state that controlled the region. They rode roughshod over the little villages and towns that dotted the old Vorutan heartland and beyond, turning fields into pasturage,\" he paused a moment, and looked out to a field they were walking along, \"as you can see the fields won out again. The inhabitants were enslaved and turned to serving their desires. An order was created that mimicked that of the heavens. The strong above, the weak below. That is the order that continues to this day, even if there is more pageantry and refinement now compared to then,\" he paused again and gave a sidelong glance to the empress, \"comparatively speaking.\"\"It was in those days that the mythical Vorutan Empire was founded, mythical because no writings of it survived the cataclysm and since they were a horse bound society no ruins can be found to determine if it indeed existed. The heartland is now the Duchy proper, and retained the same then. The claims are that the Eastern woods were tamed, and the horsemen claimed dominion to the Silverion River, and tributes from the lands beyond.
