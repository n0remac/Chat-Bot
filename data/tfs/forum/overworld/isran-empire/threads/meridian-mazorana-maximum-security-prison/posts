On the prison grounds above (that were visible to the Isranians) there were roughly 200 men total, 75 men on traditional horseback, doing patrols close to the walls' perimeters and the other 125 normal troops and some battlemagi were inside or on the walls, manning the fort's ballistae and scorpions, watching the horizons, and writing down reports of the previous days' out and in going materials.Such as the guards should have been, they were alert and spotted the Dawn Riders in the skies. The facility was put on partial lockdown when they were spotted, guards manned the defenses. The ballistae and scorpions took aim at the flying beasts but held fire for the moment, even though they were within effective range of the swivel mounted scorpions firing now would be highly inaccurate, and more than likely a waste of ammunition and the troops' stamina. Battlemagi were also present, spread in between each ballistae and began to charge for making a defense... or an offense, if the riders were dumb/brave enough to come closer to their fixed weapons.(Charge 1)", "link_list": ["/post/54652/thread", "/user/1454"], "image_list": ["http://imgur.com/RPnJGFX.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@dawnriders\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/54652/thread\" timestamp=\"1477445519\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-1454\" title=\"The Free States of Isra\"><img alt=\"The Free States of Isra Avatar\" src=\"http://imgur.com/RPnJGFX.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/54652/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1477445519000\" title=\"Oct 25, 2016 17:31:59 GMT -8\">Oct 25, 2016 17:31:59 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-1454 group-0\" href=\"/user/1454\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@dawnriders\"><span itemprop=\"name\">The Free States of Isra</span></a></span> said:</div>The prison would be at the receiving end of attention from two squads, the Seventh and Ninth Squads of the First Company of the Isran Dawn Riders.
