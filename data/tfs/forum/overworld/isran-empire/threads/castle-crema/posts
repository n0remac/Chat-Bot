She certainly looked official enough, and the detachment of Isran Cavalry seemed pretty legitimate...but what if it was all just an elaborate disguise? What if they were bandits, planning to seize the castle once he opened the gate? After all, bandits had been getting more and more common as the villages had fallen on hard times. He considered this possibility for a long while, and sighed. There really was no way around it. If they were bandits, they'd likely kill him if he refused. If they were legitimate Isran officials, he'd likely be punished for barring them entry. Besides, if they were bandits and they did seize the castle, there would likely be nobody left alive to blame him for letting them in.

The door to the keep opened, and a tall, grey-haired woman strode out to meet her. It was clear from the lines etched into her face that she had not smiled in a long while, and Noggins flinched when she spoke, as though expecting to be scolded.\"An imperial envoy,\" she said, eyeing Helevisa suspiciously. \"To what do I owe the pleasure?
