It seemed the wyvern had grown larger, much much larger. Looking up towards the sky, it did not seem that big.\u00a0When the wyvern, now dragon landed, Arya's heart sank. It was as large as the mountain, how would she ever be able to face something like that? Still, she had to try, it's hunger would not be sated until it consumed everything. She drew even more power from her sword now, drawing from all six of the minor gems of her blade, each holding enough energy to cast powerful attacks on their own, and she also finally tapped into the crown jewel of the blade, a perfect ruby that stored many times more power.\u00a0Arya gasped as the light energy began coursing through every fiber of her being. The power was so great it escaped her body in comparatively small amounts, creating a firey vortex of light energy around her that blew apart the surrounding area.

As she knelt there she would be enveloped in a blinding light for a few moments, blinding any that looked directly into it, and then Arya stood, her whole form seemed to be alive with light energy. Even her ruby eyes replaced by a blinding light that seemed to shine from within. Her golden sword also was alight with this energy, the many rubies inlaid in the blade shining a pure golden light, and as she moved the sword to hold it over her head wisps of pure light energy could be seen in the air.\u00a0All other options were exhausted to Arya, and as she stood there, ready to unleash the most destructive attack she had ever attempted to try and stop this beast, she felt sad. A couple of tears could be seen flowing from Arya's golden light eyes then, only to evaporate in seconds due to the heat the energy within her produced.\u00a0\"I'm sorry, I must stop you... or die trying.\" Arya's blade slashed downwards along her whole body, and instantly the world in front of her evaporated in a giant crescent of light energy.

This made the dragon stand upon its hind legs, wings spread out and neck shooting from side to side, roaring in pain as its eyes were exposed to the sudden intensity, upper legs curled up. It looked away to the left, closing its eyes tight as it roared once more, a tail swinging to the right. The second thing to occur was the strike itself. Now, at first, the explosion was the main distraction. And then, the slash itself. As the one impervious to the light, she would be nearly faltered in vision with a separate form of light. However, this was much different.Where the slash struck against the standing dragon, the entirety of the body of the dragon coated a pink, shield-like armor suddenly, as if a force field. The dragon hissed and roared even louder, trying to stomp backwards, making the ground shake and shudder at its presence. However, the pink limbs were seen to crack and fracture, the slash soon continuing through as the sound of glass shattering was heard, and then, the dismemberment of the beast.Roaring in pain, the limbs of the dragon fell down from the sky itself, a leg, part of the second joint in the leg, and the majority of the tail. Losing leverage, the beast soon slammed onto the ground, hissing and roaring out loudly, what appeared to be grey blood spewing from the center of the limbs. It was now apparent there was some form of physical structure to the beast. But soon, however, the bleeding would soon be halted, and the dragon began to regenerate its limbs, shrinking in overall size. It grew to its full potential once more, however, halving its size, standing upon its hind legs, the beast roared into the skies once more, looking more prideful than before, whereas it seemed terrifying and godly. The beast's eyes glowed pink for a moment, hissing out at the paladin, staring at the blade with obvious intimidation. Its old limbs twitched and squirmed on the ground, eventually failing to continue. The dragon was now seen with a more detailed figure, rather than a Goliath of rock. The beast looked down to the knight, looking to the sword as a strange hissing purr was emitted. With that, the throat was appearing to glow pink, inside, at least. The skeletal structure glowed, to be exact. After a moment of that, the choking and gagging of the dragon was emitted, and shooting into the air from its mouth was a yellow fire, forged from the magic that crippled it. Staring down to Arya, yellow smoke escaped its mouth, a grin continuing onto its face as it slowly marched forward, cocking back its head to gasp monstrously, then extend at full range to launch forth a massive, engulfing yellow fire, attempting to at least singe Arya, unknowing if Arya was impervious to her own magic.

The rhythmic clopping of eight iron hooves and the creaking mechanical sound of the massive wheels turning signify swift movement. Madame Naoki is seated in one of the frontal compartments with Artemis, Kate, and the fairy. Her right arm is wrapped about Kate\u2019s shoulders where she sits adjacent, and in the other hand a small, well worn, blue tome sits propped open between her thumb and forefinger: Dr. Brindley\u2019s Guide to The Wild and Whimsical world of Fairies. It chronicles the adventures of Dr. Richard P. Brindley, on his quest to encounter, observe, categorize, measure and record every type of fairy and fairy-like creature in the known world. As a firsthand source from an author of questionable sanity, its accuracy is debatable. However, the depth with which each specimen was observed and recorded is excellent, and the quality with which each species is documented and illustrated is\u2026 much. A lot of quality, I mean to say-  good book. In reading it, Naoki hopes to learn more about their new glowing friend by successfully determining what sort of fairy they are. Every so often, she\u2019ll hold the book up and compare one of the diagrams with a fairy , attempting to find a positive match. Atop the carriage, the roof hatch opens, and up peeks Jax, a man of middling age with a close-cropped auburn beard.  It\u2019s time for him to survey the surroundings, part of his duties as a carriage attendant. Stepping partially up the ladder such that the upper half of his body protrudes upwards, he takes a spyglass from his belt. Raising it to his eye, he pans around, checking the road ahead, the road behind, the great mountain faces rising up to either side of the road. If anyone would be following the carriage, watching it from above, if anyone moves to block their path, or otherwise to complicate their journey, it is his job to be aware.And- at least for the time being, everything seems fine. Hardly a well traveled road, the roadway ahead is rough, but empty of enemies, or indeed, any other traffic at all. A few examples of the local wildlife can be seen in the mountains around, a few goats here, a few birds there, but none that Jax categorizes as a threat. But then, far off in this distance, a low rumbling echoes through the mountains, reverberating between the peaks stretching up to either side of the roadway, and through the ground itself. Lowering the looking glass, Jax spins about, attempting to pinpoint the source of the noise, but finds it impossible to do so. The sound seems to emanate from all around, the left, the right, even the ground itself.  The shape of the mountains and the trees serve to diffuse and obfuscate the origin of the sound. A brief mental communication between the two carriage operators. Stan hears it too. At a whipping of the reigns, the rhythmic clopping of hooves increases in tempo, and the wheels turn faster. Pulling himself fully up out of the carriage and securing the hatch behind him, Jax moves across the roof to stand behind the mounted weapon. A quick check to ensure the advanced magical device is in proper working order, and the spyglass comes back out to sweep the terrain with heightened urgency. Within the carriage, the passengers would likely be insulated from the sound and the vibrations by the vehicle\u2019s armor and suspension, respectively. However, the carriage attendants, as ordered, immediately inform Madame Naoki and Artemis of the disturbance. Within the carriage, Naoki receives their message with no outward showing of distress. Eye contact and silent communication with Artemis, and a consensus is reached. Naoki sends a message to Lum'Valia  and Maelik The Fellblade , out in the main compartment. Pardon me, you two. It seems that there\u2019s some manner of disturbance outside. We\u2019re not sure what it is yet, but it seems to be something very large, pounding the ground and causing the mountains to tremble. If I might, I would like to suggest that one or both of you head out, and take advantage of your ability to fly to determine just what sort of beast or individual is out there, causing the ground to shake so. It might be something powerful and hostile, so please exercise all due caution, and keep us posted on what you see.Having informed the pair of them, Naoki continues just as she was, not meaning to alarm Kate or the pair in the adjacent cabin. (Those two are already probably already going at it anyway.) Once again, she compares a fairy to one of the diagrams in the book, and seems to have found a positive identification. \"This one seems to match reasonably well... What do you think?\"She speaks to the small room at large, attempting to solicit the opinion, if not of the fairy itself, of Kate, or Artemis.

He did work up enough motivation to put on pants but without something to keep him focused he fell into a mini stupor. One could surmise that there was a reason he always seemed to be trying to keep himself busy.Occasionally he would would get up and make sweets but generally speaking he was a big scaly lump that took up a great deal of seat space on one half of the Mae/Lum/twins compartment.He wanted to probe Lum for more stories, mostly as an excuse to get to know her even better but he felt that with Klur resting and the twins... well being the twins, now was not the best time.

I assume that I shouldn't have to point out the obvious here but I'll just go ahead and say it anyway for clarity's sake.\"He bent down and looked them each in the eye with a uncle-y smile, one that said 'yeah I'm friendly but you'd better do what I say or else.'\"I will tolerate no harm coming to that child, not a single hair on his head. Nor will I allow for any trauma either mental or psychological to mar him, are we clear?\"Assuming that the twins nod and assure him in a believable way Maelik calmly slips out the door and soon after exits the wagon, taking flight in pursuit of his angelic counter part.It didn't take him long to figure out the mess that was unfolding before them, a massive dragon of some sort was seemingly engaged in mortal combat with a sizzling slab of people jerky. As he got closer to the problem though he began to make out more precise details, namely the armor and weaponry of the Kentucky Fried Paladin.\"Oh damn, it's a crispy crunch Arya,\" he muttered, his eyes following Lum's descent down to the scorched combatant's side. His gaze didn't linger for too long though, the massive dragon not too far off beckoned for Maelik's attention far more pressingly.\"Well, that's a big one... With Lum so close to that thing I can't take the time to gather enough energy to properly handle things,\" he said, verbally going through his available options.\"So in the interest of preventing any harm to Lum I guess I'd best draw it's attention... Hmmm, but how to do that?\"The demon flapped a bit closer and began to gather his aura within himself, stockpiling it to fuel the strength of his future spells. Currently however he didn't have to option to expel any of that energy to any notable effect so he did what any hot blooded male would do if given the option.He lobbed a sizable rock at it and called it a name.\"HEY BOULDER BALLS! COME AND GET SOME!\"Should the rock fail in its intent to garner the beast's attention Maelik would resort to a larger rock (about the size of a tree) and then a flat out demonic fireball.\"EXCUSE ME!

Why I'll have you know that I'm a pureblooded monster thank you very much sir,\" he responded with more than a little snark, trying to mask his unease after hearing the dragon's threats. The former lord was not used to being on the receiving end of malicious death threats, and he was even less used to not being able to immediately put a stop to them.Under normal circumstances he would simply retreat and do an extensive study on the beast, after the monologue he certainly had enough information to go off of, but in this case he was anchored here. Lum (and to a slightly lesser extent Arya) were vulnerable and unable to vacate the area, as such it was up to him to distract and hopefully harm the beast enough to dissuade it from continuing its attack.So in a spurt of uncharacteristic magnanimity he decided to stand and fight the titanic dragon off, but it would be very difficult to do so underneath it. So Maelik waited for an opportune time to slide out and continue his assault from the air, and as such was forced to watch with growing anger as the monster threatened that which he prized most.\"That tears it... You may be bigger, stronger, tougher and maybe even older than me but I swear, if you touch her I'll rip your head off and shit down your throat.\"He was going to continue along that line of foul language (even escalating the potty mouth further) but the light magic breath attack forced him to zip his lip and deal with the problem at hand instead.His expert eye judged that there was little hope for him to fully evade the radius of the attack without magical aid. So even as he took to the air and rocketed away as fast as he could the demon hissed out a few arcane syllables, draining some of his stored magic and reinforcing his demonic aura to better protect him. Apparently fear for others was more potent than fear for one's self as Maelik managed to cover far more distance than he anticipated and only the fringe of the light attack caught him, the brunt of the damage being absorbed by his wards as he was blown the rest of the way out by the blast.But he wasn't through yet, he may not be able to pierce this beast with his swords but he had sharper weapons at his disposal.

He was groggy, tired and nauseous; his head spinning and his body numb and tingly as it woke again after so very long.Where was he? Why couldn't he see? What had happened to him? Why could he hear the beating of the pulse within his ears and feel the dryness of his eyes and mouth? Why was his mind so blank, so calm, so full of a quickly diminishing feeling of everlasting peace? It was as though he was enlightened, yet by waking and becoming aware of himself he was descending back into the darkness of prior existence where death, suffering, pain and melancholy were an immovable layer of rock that kept him from true bliss.Rock.. Yes. He moved his arm, pushing his hand up against the darkness until it cracked and splintered. The stone broke, with dust and debris crumbling down against the soft clothing that covered him while his hand broke free and felt rushing air between it's fingers. He bent his elbow, breaking yet more stone from his form, then clutched at the stone covering his chest and pressed down with his fingers until that too cracked and crumbled away. He kept doing this, until his second arm was free to help his first break open the mask that covered his face. Rushing wind, blue sky, clouds... It was marvellous, despite the overwhelming sense of dread growing within him.\"Be free again.\"The voice was not his own, nor did he hear it through his ears. It spoke directly into his mind, implanting a sense of worth within his soul; an order, a message containing far more than those three simple words could possibly have told by themselves. He began to break more of the stone from around him, more frantic now. His chest, his neck, his head; allowing his white hair to be whipped by the wind around him; his legs and groin and hips and feet. Soon he was free, until only a bed of rock lay beneath him; a broken\u00a0cocoon from which he had emerged.\u00a0\u00a0He span over, then fell. He had not been falling before, yet now he was in the air with no solid place around him that could have held him. There was just cloud, freezing wind and the white mountain-peaks far below him that he soon realised were now privy to a creature that was moving; yet from his height he should not be able to see any such thing that lived. Unless...\u00a0It was one of them. A titan. A beast. A colossus large enough to flatten cities with a single stroke. As he fell, he saw it take the shape of a dragon and fight against another being too small for him to make out, yet this dragon was stone like the mountains around it and it roared with the force to tear forests from the ground.\u00a0\"They have risen.\"He pushed himself into a dive and held out his hand, which soon gripped the handle of a spear that grew from nothing until it reached a size twice as long as a man and revealed a blade that was more great-sword than pike. The great dragon was getting closer to him now; he was falling faster towards it, the mountains beginning to rise up towards him like spikes. A chain from the end of his spear swung out towards his left hand and passed through his flesh and into his arm, where it became connected like an unbreakable shackle yet caused no wound on his skin.\u00a0\"They threaten everything.\"His eyes focused and his teeth clenched, with his hair sweeping back behind him as the great Shattered King became an island that blocked out entire\u00a0kilometres\u00a0from sight. Suddenly, he rolled, then bent his knees up towards his chest and compressed his muscles to build power. The falling figure was visible now; like a star from the sky with such force and momentum in his dive that the air became visible as he tore through it at blinding speed.\"Destroy them.\"The words echoed through his mind as the back of the beast came upon him. Suddenly, he kicked down with both and planted all of his gathered force and momentum directly down into one, specific point on the dragon's back; suddenly multiplied at the very last minute by the inhuman strength of the man behind them. Unless the Dragon had noticed the falling man and moved fast enough to avoid something with such a velocity, it would take the full force of a divekick powerful enough to break mountains. The deafening impact alone would create a shockwave capable of clearing snow from the nearby peaks, while the dragon had a chance to not only have his back broken open by an incredibly impact crater, but it would almost certainly contain enough thrust behind it to push the beast downwards at the ground.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<font color=\"#000000\">\"Awaken...\"</font>"}, "post-24273": {"user": null, "user_num": null, "timestamp": "1455857464000", "message": "Marduk approaches the region on foot, a heavy iron cross resting across his shoulders.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Marduk approaches the region on foot, a heavy iron cross resting across his shoulders."}, "post-24310": {"user": null, "user_num": null, "timestamp": "1455869011000", "message": "K'krahkov flew to the mountains, searching for what Altameir had said was \"a 'dragon level' threat.\" He was amused by the term.

Slithering around the warrior, however, was Rag'Novok, wings smashing onto the ground and feet continuous in a circular motion.\"Oh, you must rise now, ancient warrior.\" He dragon for some reason complimented, those with a good vision witnessing his lower-center back snapping and forming together from the rock that had landed under him. \"I know you to withstand more than my weight, Syrossss.\" His voice hissed out, the wings flapping to remove all of the dust in that general area, looking down to see whatever state the Champion of Titans was in.\"It matters not your power, your intentions.\" The dragon spoke calmly, walking around once more as he lifted a rock, crushing it as the current was seen slithering through the rubble and cracked stone. \"I am Godly, the first of the Titans Reborn. My wrymlings have fallen to you, but I, am something much more ancient. Your weapon will not pierce my heart, it is forbidden!\" He hissed out, soon a snap of attention shown at his head as he looked around him to see the newly brought warriors, chuckling evilly as he spun around, winding himself up once more as he looked down to Syros.\"And you will see, even now, the world has forgotten you, while I still live on!\"\u00a0Rag'Novok declared, referring to the lack of acknowledgment the people had given his impressive intro. He launched forward, expecting such a Godly warrior as Syros to easily counter or dodge his strike, slithering around him, hiding within the dust once more. \"I've slithered into the hearts of nightmares, fed upon the fears of the mountains.\" His face soon slammed forward along with his two mighty front feet as he stared down to Syros. \"GODS HAVE TREMBLED BEFORE ME!\" He chanted aloud, shaking his head, followed by his neck, to remove some of the dust his body rejected. \"And so, eventually, you shall as well, as soon as you realize my true existence. What happens now, Syros?\" He questioned, continuing to be heard circling him at different paces and speeds within the fog.\"Shall you try to fight? Or will you stand there and watch those around you Die?\" He questioned, flapping upwards and spinning in a circle into the air, wings spread mightily as he soon looked down to Lum'Valia, a strange magic occurring with her, a grin upon himself. \"And so the mighty Angel wishes to declare her magic upon a God!\" He exclaimed, flying creatively through the air as he slowly was making his way towards Lum.At this time, however, only the few powerful ones at this moment would see the chest-region of the dragon pulsate with a pink light, obviously preparing for something to occur, however, easily comfortable in the face with all that was going on. \"I am the Mountains!\" He exclaimed, crashing into another mountain-peak. \"I am the ocean floors..\" He crashed into one other, sending massive rocks raining down upon those around him, now exploding through the center of a more massive mountain, leaving it with new scales and armor upon his body as he stared down to Lum. \"I, am what you breathe upon! I am the life of this earth, and he who chooses to raze it!

Then the dragon crashed through a nearby mountain, sending rocks exploding outwards all over the valley between the ranges with enough force to destroy a city. Was he healing himself? Syros asked, noticing that many of the damaged rocks upon the dragon's body were being replaced by those from the mountains he destroyed. It seemed they were disadvantaged in this location.Yet soon the dragon made for another mountain, no doubt eager to destroy yet more of the landscape he seemed to despise.

It was apparent that without time to amass his own power that he would be unable to pierce the beast's defenses, so any purely offensive action was simply out of the question. But without proper preparation he wasn't left with many options other than to simply throw himself at the creature and hope that Lum's plan worked.And so with some internal seeking the demon found his core and embraced his rage, allowing it to take control whilst keeping one thing in mind. The enemy was the big one, not the small one.Strength flowed into him, his limbs bulged and surged with hateful energy and his aura condensed into a light eating shroud. Then, like a weighty guided missile he rocket away once more. There was little thought behind his actions, he simply felt the need, no it was more of a compulsion, to rip and tear and kill something. The huge rock that had Lum's name on it may have indeed been... well... large... but Maelik had faced down things far worse than mere boulders. He cracked open his maw and a gout of black flames shot out in a line, meeting the stone with it's fiery roar as the sheer heat of the hellfire started to melt away at the rock.

At first it would seem that the demon was just brainlessly going to run into Rag'Novok's face (where there happened to be plenty of sharp pointy teeth) but in actuality in a turn of bestial cunning he suddenly dip down. Like an erratic fly Maelik would keep turning at sharp and quite random directions, trying to keep the larger beast guessing until he could find an opportunity to get under him once more.

Now, indeed, the dragon was worried. Such a spell created by the Arc-Angel was formed, and now humming with power, the dragon flew in to the air higher and higher, soon meeting slightly above such a symbol, lighting it with light fire as it was being activated. Nothing was working! He attempted to fly through it- Even use the strange, pink fire! The air and space around it, the light, appeared to condense and bend until the fire dissipated, but yet the symbol remained.And so from there, the beam connected with him. The dragon roared mightily, limbs outstretched, wings mightily raised outwards and his head thrown to the sky, roaring in pain with widened eyes, the massive, pink shield faltering and shattering from the magic once more. At this time, the dragon began to shrivel and curl into a ball, kicking and squirming in hundreds of positions before the blinding light would soon blind all that were even capable of viewing such a mountain range.Luckily for one like Syros, who remained upon his back, the shell exploded, sending hundreds of large, and small, pieces towards the ground. As this occurred, however, so did something else strange. Pink, blinding, and insignificant compared to the massive dragon beforehand, a comet crashed towards the ground with what entailed to be a skeletal, tormented figure surrounding it. From there, the dragon was seen, a pulsing, glowing rock formed at the center of the chest.And from that rock hummed a strong, dense sound, a heart beat heard for a few seconds, before the dragon's back arched, single, shattered wing outstretched. His tail was half gone, yet it flailed around as it could, legs standing mightily tall as far out as possible. During this time, now, gravity changed, the physics upon this small, chaotic battle shifting. The pull started off weak, simply bringing forth the dust nearby, but with each pulse heard from the crystal, the denser the pull became, soon lifting up smaller rocks as well as the minor boulders in the area.Then came the larger rocks, and at this point, sucking in warriors from where they stood. It would now be time to take afoot, to run from this sudden pulling as the dragon continued to try to stabilize itself, stone crashing into its chest that made it stagger and fall back and forth, but soon was absorbed. Eventually, the hills and walls of the mountains nearby began to crackle and falter, soon pulling even larger masses towards itself as it attempted to perform some strange ritual.As the gravitational pull intensified, even the vessel Klur was in was beginning to slightly move and stagger, but not for long. Lum now without her wings would sense the sudden grasp towards her, and in her own eyes, where no one else could see, the dragon's phantom, massive fist reaching outwards towards her, clasping around her as it began to pull her in more than the others. However, this was only an illusion made by the crystal, where anyone who wished to act upon her intensified pull could easily stop it, making her illusion irrelevant to the scene it emitted. Maelik would feel his chest pulled downwards suddenly towards the dragon's core, but would soon be capable of returning his strength to his hand as his wings would flap. With a massive piece of himself colliding into the ground and crashing forward, the dragon was launched backwards, the gravity ceasing to be and The Shattered seen skidding backwards and falling off of the cliffside, silent.And then, within only a few seconds, it'd be seen, crashing into the air with a sudden, powerful, mighty!- Limping body, falling against a mountain as the pathetic dragon was now seen. It could've been no larger than a few meters long, a wingspan large, but made entirely of the magic from its core. \"Thu'uz Nav'ok!! Ahhh!!! It Burns!!!\" The dragon shouted out, clasping against its own chest as the wings were now seen to be deformed, the missing pieces of them replaced with a phantom wing, made entirely from pink energy and left a small, fading trail of the same color. \"I will show you agony!!\" It roared violently in pain, though obviously in absolutely no condition to enact upon this threat. Staggering in the air, nearly falling a hundred times already, the dragon began to fly away.

She approaches the group,  and raises a hand in greeting. She is still wearing the well made and simplistic traveling outfit: gray sweater and black trousers. An appraising gaze sweeps the each of the combatants as she visually confirms and assesses their statuses. She notices Maelik's missing appendage, but tactfully decides not to mention it aloud. He's doubtless already aware of it, and mentioning it would just serve to trouble Lum. However, beyond Maelik's injury, everyone is apparently unharmed,  and that's cause enough for a cheery smile on Naoki's part.As she comes closer, she nods to everyone, gives Ayra a thumbs up, and addressees Lum, who is now apparently conscious, \"Excellent work. Jax is coming over with a stretcher, hang in there for a moment longer.\" Finished with that, she approaches Ildesias, and with a slight curtsy, begins to speak. \"Lord Ildesias. As you can see,  the battle between the dragon my messengers informed you and these heroes of mine is complete, and resulted in a victory for us. The dragon in question was reduced in size drastically,  and is as we speak flying...\"She pauses to obtain the information from her scouts.\"...away to the west, currently about ten kilometers from our position in that direction,\" she points, \"and moving about as quickly as a common bird. It seemed, while it was here, to be some manner of stone dragon, capable of absorbing the mountains to add to its own mass. Hence the extensive damage to the landscape; there used to be a mountain where we're standing, I believe. I have a pair of my agents trailing the beast as it flees, such that someone might be dispatched to finish the job. I managed to collect a great deal of information about it as it fought, and have a transcript of everything it said. As soon as I'm able, I'll prepare and have delivered to you a full written after-action report containing all of my collected knowledge of the beast and the events that transpired here.\"Here, finished with that primary point, she pauses, and takes a deep breath. Dust of pulverized rock is still in the air, tainting the otherwise fresh mountain air. She coughs a bit on the particulate matter, but recovers quickly and continues.\"I should also mention. In addition to the actions of my friends here, there was another individual who assisted us in battle against the titanic dragon. He was male... tall, with... it seemed like silver hair. He carried a massive spear, which must have been ten meters long at the very least. He moved with superhuman strength and speed, entering the battle from the sky, descending from above to deal a crushing blow to the dragon's midsection. We lost sight of him in the lightshow following the titan's defeat, but I imagine he's around here somewhere.\"She pauses again, gesturing around to the shattered landscape. An individual could be easily obscured behind any one of the innumerable boulders and debris that litter the ground.\"Also, the stone dragon seemed to know the fellow. It referred to him as... 'Syrossss,'\" she does a comical impression of the dragon- though she cannot quite replicate the immensely deep tone of voice that comes with having lungs the size of city blocks.\"Regardless, Syros' assistance was invaluable, I doubt the monster could have been defeated without his help. Personally, I hadn't heard of Syros before today, and I make a point of knowing about anyone that strong. His identity beyond that name, allegiance, and motivations for assisting us today are completely unknown to me. Also, seeing as how it seemed to recognize him, it is mt assumption that Syros might know more than we do about the origins of the titanic dragon, so it might be worth asking him about; if he can be located and engaged in discussion.\"At this point,  Jax approaches with a large stretcher under one arm,  and the carriage's medical kit in the other hand. He whispers to Arya, Maelik and Lum in introduction, greeting, and praise, and suggests that Ayra, if she's feeling up to it, help him get Lum onto the stretcher and into the carriage,  and that Maelik go ahead and bandage up that stump, so it doesn't bleed everywhere.Back over with Ildesias, Naoki remembers her manners. \"Oh! I'm sorry; please excuse me.  I failed to introduce you all, or explain any of the context as to why we're all bumming around in the boonies out here.\"With a great deal of waving and pointing, she begins introductions. \"Everyone,  this is Lord Ildesias Xen Torsal , of Isra. This is Mr. Maelik The Fellblade , formerly Demonlord of Wrath. This is Ms. Lum'Valia , a holy dragon of some note, and... Miss? Miss Ayra. Who I've not yet had the pleasure of meeting until just now. We'll have to shake later. I believe she functions as a paladin of some description,  but I'm afraid I don't know more than that.\"\"This is Jax, one of my carriage attendants, and back in the carriage, we should have Miss Green, Miss Skarlet, Mr. d'Artusio, young Lorelei,  Lucia,  and Klur,  as well as an as of yet unnamed fairy,  and Stan, my fine carriage driver, and all of them friends of mine.\"\"We were, with the exception of Ayra, who was already doing battle with the dragon when we arrived, driving up to a house I've had built up here in the mountains...\"  She turns, and gestures off in a direction behind her. \"...roughly thirty kilometers in that direction, with the intention to relax. However we were, as you can see, rather rudely interrupted by that titanic dragon. Once we are all finished here, I intend to continue our journey there, and would like to extend the invitation to both yourself and Ayra, if you'd care to come.\"Realizing that she's been talking for far too long than is probably polite, and that she should probably allow Ildesias to get a word in, Naoki stops here, and stands silently,  hands clasped behind her back.", "link_list": ["/user/193", "/user/60", "/user/867"], "image_list": [], "html": "With a great clattering of hooves and crunching of pebbles under wheels, the great iron carriage approaches and comes to a halt a short ways away from the assembled party."}, "post-24763": {"user": "Maelik The Fellblade", "user_num": 60, "timestamp": "1456185219000", "message": "Maelik lifted his head up high as Naoki and her carriage arrived but despite appearances he was listening to Lum intently.\"Of course dear,\" he pandered, his deep voice magnified by his even larger than normal size. \"I'll be glad to.\"By the time the carriage had come to a halt before them Maelik was already shakily trying to regain his footing, primarily through the means of supplanting the function of his missing leg with his tail. However he didn't want Lum to worry and as such he'd block her line of sight with one of his wings and put on the most stoic expression his draconic visage could do. With the utmost care he scooped Lum and Arya up in his right claw and began his hobble.\"Klur will be so pleased to see his 'mommy' again. I bet you a cookie he'll giggle and gurgle with glee...\"He stumbled a bit on the first step but managed to recover by thrusting his head down into the ground to steady himself before attempting to move on, briefly interrupted by Naoki's introduction of the group to Ildesias.

It was fine though, for only he needed to read it.\"It seems I have quite a lot to do now.

First, I must go south to Enlidil's hold and let our garrison there know of what has transpired while organizing a relief, search and rescue effort to this area.

He put one foot in a stirrup, then climbed up over onto it's back. He looked down at Naoki again, then nodded. \"I have never heard of this individual you mentioned, but if it is truly possible that he might know of this beast and why it came here, I will make sure to have agents and scouts look for him and bring him back to Isra for questioning.

Until that time I will simply bear it and move on, just as I told Arya earlier, you've done enough.\"Maelik heard Arya's exclamation and tried to calm her as well but it would seem that she had the energy to actually attempt to heal his wounds and he was fine with allowing it, within reason of course.He scooped them both up once more, urging Arya to wait until they could sit down in peace before trying to heal him. Light magic may not harm him but it did have a draining effect and he didn't want to fall over and crush anyone by accident. He turned to Jax again and removed his claws from the earth, needing the free hand to keep his balance.\"If something comes up or you need anything we'll be in our room, do feel free to come and get me but you leave Lum alone. She'll need her rest.\"With that he took another few wobbly steps but due to his huge gait he could cover a vast distance. Once he indeed got close enough to the door that he could gently place the two women inside the threshold Maelik would do so and shrink back down to his normal size.He was still missing his leg and going was pretty hard, apparently it was actually harder to get anywhere as a biped then as a quadruped. He fell down the few steps a couple of times and ate dirt more than once, even slamming his head against the side of the wagon but eventually he managed to join the girls inside.He took it upon himself to saddle Lum onto him and crawl to their compartment from there, and he refused to take no for an answer, even willing to tie her to him if need be. Once inside he'd put Lum on her spot and say hello to the twins, noticing the mess that their experiments made.But the demon had practically bled a pond by now and he couldn't work up the motivation to chastise them, instead opting to plop himself down in his half and motion that it was safe for Arya to do what she wished.The light magic would certainly a healing force, but it lacked the sheer strength of Lum's and the Maelik's demonic aura put up quite a fight against it. Her healing was actively being forced away by the searing touch of his own horrid power and the demon found himself needing to focus his blood drained mind to suppress it from lashing out to try to harm the paladin. Eventually Arya's magic wore down his defenses and drained away the aura, allowing for the healing to advance from a mostly ineffective crawl to what Arya was used to experiencing. Almost immediately after that Maelik passed out, his quiet snores muffled by the cushions of the seat. Being a demon who regularly saw non demonic healing was rough...

However, I thought it polite to offer. Perhaps you could drop by another time.\u201dAs Ildesias mounts his griffin, Naoki takes a moment to gaze around at the landscape. Indeed, there had been a mountain where they are standing. The ground underfoot is rough, untouched by erosion. Layers of rock are clearly visible in a sort of cross section brought about by the violent tearing of the dragon\u2019s appropriation of the mountain. Lying just a few meters away, an uprooted tree lies splintered on the ground. The powers that participated in that battle were likely among the most powerful in the world. She\u2019s surrounded by individuals that are capable of moving mountains and massive feats of magic. It\u2019s almost humbling. But then she remembers that they all fight with her, and the last idiot that tried to screw with them got obliterated by a holy laser. So it is humbling, in that she knows the extremely limited extent that she is capable of personally defending herself, but also inspires feelings of accomplishment, in having made such excellent and powerful allies, and pride, in that her friends did such an excellent job of removing the latest threat with such extreme force. Her musings are interrupted as Ildesias inquires as to if she has anything else to say. She looks up at him on his griffin, shielding her eyes from the sun as it rises behind him, making a dark silhouette of his form. \u201cI don\u2019t believe so. You can expect my full report to reach you by the end of today. Have a safe ride back, and I look forward to speaking with you at a greater length later.\u201dShe nods her head, mimicking his display of respect, and watches silently as he takes to the sky and departs, soon losing sight of him behind one of the remaining mountain peaks. She takes another moment to gaze around, and reflects on how incredibly fortunate it was that they happened across the titanic stone dragon before it reached any major settlements, how incredibly fortunate it was that she had opted to invite Maelik and Lum, and how Syros had decided to drop in and assist them all. She imagines what might have happened if the thing had reached Isra. It would have been dealt with- and a victory would have been reached all the same by the combined and concentrated forces of The Black Tower, The Conjunction, and Isra\u2019s military (including the specialised dragon slaying Seraph), but to think of how many would have died. It would have been the first national disaster of any significant magnitude, and it had been so narrowly avoided by her choice in house guests, the intervention of a stranger, and the scheduling nuances that placed their trip on this particular day. Perhaps the thing, when spotted by one of Reese\u2019s observational outposts around Isra, could have been dealt with in a similar manner away from the city without great loss of life. But still. Far too many fortunate coincidences for Naoki to feel safe. She resolves to order increased regional surveillance, and after doing so, returns to the carriage. Stepping up the ladder silently, she enters the primary compartment of the carriage to find Lum, Maelik and Arya all asleep. She smiles, again overcome with pride. All of that fighting must have been quite tiring. Maelik\u2019s leg is back, and not bleeding on the rug; good. The lot of them seem to be breathing, also good. Approaching the bench, she moves quietly to fasten the restraint belts around Lum and Arya, careful not to wake them. A simple hook into ring, they would both find the restraints simple to unfasten when they wake, and until then, the belts should keep them from falling off the bench as they sleep. She doesn\u2019t bother to belt Maelik in. He\u2019s tough. If he bumps his head, the worst that would happen is that he might get aggravated and use fire magic to roast the carriage from the inside. Realizing this, she moves as if to attempt to secure him, but stops when she realizes that he\u2019s three times her size, and altogether too large to make proper use of the restraining belts. How does he even fit in here? Maybe he could do that thing where large individuals assume human form again.That would be both convenient, and decidedly more cuddly, she muses. But until then, he\u2019ll have to deal with it. Trusting the twins and Klur not to do anything they\u2019ll regret, Madame Naoki excuses herself with silent steps to her cabin in the front of the carriage, where Kate and the fairy presumably still wait. As she shuts the door behind her, the great horses pull the carriage into motion once more.[Exit to Chalet Du Sommet Minuit with Kate Green, Artemis, a fairy, Skarlet, Francesco d'Artusio, Maelik The Fellblade, Lum'Valia, @klur, Lorelei & Lucia, and Arya Shieldheart]", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1179/chalet-du-sommet-minuit", "/user/567", "/user/608", "/user/577", "/user/257", "/user/662", "/user/60", "/user/867", "/user/620", "/user/997"], "image_list": [], "html": "\u201cI understand completely- it was hard enough for me to find this time, and your schedule is even more packed than my own.

No, her emotions, her thoughts, and what she felt are what made her feel lost. She had felt so ready that faithful night when Artemis had invited her to that room. She knew it herself, Artemis knew it, yet Arya had been wrong. The paladin could not bring herself to blame the blonde-haired bodyguard for her own foolish expectations, but she could not help but feel crushed.

She was about halfway up the mountain, with a deep valley below her just down the steep slope, and a towering mountain at her back. Perhaps she couldn't ever find someone else to be with, to be in a relationship that was closer than just mere friends as she had with Jun and Maelik, or an apprentice as she was to Lum'valia. What did she do wrong? She was sure Jun had a boyfriend, how could she not? And Lum'valia had Maelik. A holy dragon and a demon, the most unlikely of pairs became closer than Arya had ever been with anyone. The thought of her frustrated her, and she would kick one of the loose rocks near her feet, sending it tumbling down the snow covered slope.\u00a0Arya would watch it for some time before it finally came to a rest near the bottom of the valley next to a frozen stream. Perhaps she should just stick to her original vows as a paladin, even though she had already broken many of them.
