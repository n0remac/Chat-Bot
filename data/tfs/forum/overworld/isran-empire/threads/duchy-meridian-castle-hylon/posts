It is a wide, sprawling castle with an unusual shape owing to the irregular terrain upon which it was built. In spite of this, it stands tall and resilient, looking westward over the sea to watch the sun set below the distant horizon.\t", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/gDAhF0H.jpg"], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><img alt=\"https://i.imgur.com/gDAhF0H.jpg\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/gDAhF0H.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/></div>"}, "post-73531": {"user": "Grandma", "user_num": 602, "timestamp": "1506727393000", "message": "The Imperial Vizier chose to arrive at Meridian without causing much of a stir. Materializing directly outside of the gatehouse, Grandma quickly shut down any attempts from the guards to give her a proper welcome or meet with the inhabitants of Castle Hylon. She had come here for one reason and that reason didn\u2019t involve chit-chatting with the Meridian leadership.Although not particularly happy about their request for a proper greeting being rebuffed, the castle staff and guards quickly and quietly led her to the well-guarded vault that was deep within Castle Hylon once she made her intentions clear. At the vault itself, there were several Imperial Guards, experienced ones by the look of it. They were expecting her, of course. She had contacted them in advance through the telepathic network that Isra made use of. Such was the procedure for them to allow someone into the vault.The unlocking process of the vault took a few minutes, requiring a number of magic barriers that had been added to the vault by Isranian mages to be removed. Once all the magic was released, the vault door was pulled outwards and Grandma entered, commanding all others to stay outside. What she had come for was prominently displayed on a pedestal on the right wall of the vault. A dark-colored gem, almost like translucent bronze.Walking over briskly, the old woman lifted the gem from the pedestal, pulling on the magic that lay within the gem. A brief series of tremors passed through the vault walls as she did so, but with how quickly they dissipated, some might doubt if they had even occurred or not. Her expression didn\u2019t change at all, but there was a glint of hunger in her eyes. Without a further word, Grandma\u2019s form began to dissipate, both her and the gem going up in a wave of smoke.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The Imperial Vizier chose to arrive at Meridian without causing much of a stir.
