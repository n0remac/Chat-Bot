The tremendous, beautiful manor is only accessible by a long and winding road that travels through the dense pine forest of the estate, through the small town of Rosewood, and around the large Correa Vineyard. The manor itself is surrounded on all sides by the pines, and the Norakari mountains stand tall behind it. If one was to stand in the highest tower, one could easily see the steeple of the Rosewood church over the trees further down the hills, and the edge of the estate far beyond. The manor itself sits at the end of a long, straight road with a gate at the very end, often kept closed so lady Elena Correa can enjoy her privacy. The manor features multiple floors and several different sections, and even a basement and wine cellar, much of which is rarely seen by anyone other than Elena and her butler, Mr. Chambers. The manor boasts ten bedrooms, each one as lovely as the last, except for the master suite which has been decorated and pampered beyond measure over the years. Twenty washrooms dotted around the premises allows customers to be comfortable without running desperately through the many halls, especially when hosted in the large and lavish dining hall or ballroom, both of which haven't seen use since the last family gathering. Guests are also allowed access to the huge, two story library at the heart of the manor, the large lounge room with its plush furniture and exquisite decorations, and reading room, where one can enjoy something from the library with a glass of sherry in front of one of the many fireplaces. Of course, there are many areas locked off to all but lady Elena and Mr. Chambers. These include the greenhouse where Elena tends to her more fickle plants, the private study where most of her business is done, and her private wardrobe, among many other chambers and rooms that only she is privy too, and their secrets locked away behind thick doors with intricate locks. Most are usually taken aback by the grand foyer before they even have a chance to think what kind of secrets lay beyond the closed doors. Though usually kept relatively dark and dim, when properly lit the extravagance becomes apparent, with red carpets leading up the rich mahogany stairs that match the building's trim, surrounded by the cold grey brick. Paintings hang all around, large and small, depicting friends, family, events, and so much more. The grounds of the manor are well kept by Mr. Chambers, as is the stable, in which lady Correa's personal coach and horses are kept. They're a strong bunch, but something isn't quite right about them\u2026 The gardens are quiet and we'll maintained, leading right up to the treeline. Statues stand silently at key locations, all along the pathways leading to and fro. Even the gazebo, which has perhaps seen more use in earlier days, has its own permanent patron. Quite the building for one person, one could say, but for Lady Elena Correa, it's home and has been for over a hundred years.
