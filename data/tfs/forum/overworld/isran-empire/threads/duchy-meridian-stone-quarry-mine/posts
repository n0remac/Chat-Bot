Gold? Silver!?\" With that, his hands glowed a green color, the markings upon his body glowing now in green, but black smoke rising from them as well. Lowering himself to a stance, a ritual-like formation of his hands emitted, dancing the small glowing cubes floating at his palms around.It seemed like quite a few minutes, at least eight, before Thrashnald soot as tall as his body could let him, stretching his arms to the sky, eyes glowing green as a mighty right foot stepped backwards, the arms stretching out behind him, making a 90 degree angle with the rest of his body.

At this point, now flowing out, was this strange grey fluid, rushing out to hide any activity going on inside the cave.To them, it seemed as if everything was melting, however, only a tunnel from the entrance was being dug downwards, the fluid happening to in fact be stone, in some strange, altered formation. It was not molten lava, nor was it dust, but a fluid-like formation of the stone. Pouring out was the last bit, travelling all the way to circle around this, Levanius Curio. As if to scare him, Thrashnald turned his body to face the male, spreading his arms apart and raising them upwards together, his thumbs nudged against one another as all the stone was soon raised into the sky, levitating now!! A sinister grin grew upon Thrashnald, who violently struck his left fist into the ground, the cube growing to be covering his fist rather than floating above. From there, came the formation, the stone organizing itself to form ratherly half of a small fort, then came down Thrashnald's left hand to mimic the reflected piece, a small entryway for Levanius Curio to walk out of. Remaining along the grass lands (But not for long, as with a simple look towards the ogres they began sprinting about picking up all of them) jewels and ores and oddities were seen glistening and strewn about from the raw stone that was plucked.Entering the tunnel one would see a mighty stairway heading downwards, a couple hundred steps to be closer to exact, before the tunnel continued further, completely perfected stonework and without a flaw.

So from there the pile of various treasures was left on the grass, and the ogres emitted a single line into the cave's mouth, marching down the steps with Thrashnald. From there, pickaxes made from magic some wielded, others whips to force the others to work harder, even when they were trying their best. Others had used either giant chunks of rock or pieces of iron ore from the treasures they'd give later to smash open the tunnels to continue their mining.Thrashnald, however, walked further down the tunnel, spawning with a portal a strange necromancy table, decked out with many strange symbols.The blade was stabbed cleanly into the skull above, his hands lowering to the table to focus for many, many moments. Opening his eyes once more he chuckled evilly, growing in a more insane manner to find the right pitch he'd accept to close the laugh. Yanking his sword from the podium he turned around. \"I shall return!!! More back to your work!!!\" He shouted out with a crazed second laugh, slicing into the air as he marched into the portal as whips cracked and rocks exploded..After what seemed like an entire day to the ogres (which really was only 6 hours) the portal came back once more, with Thrashnald slamming to the ground, roaring in agony, pain, annoyance, and near-death. A massive spear was in his shoulder, which he yanked out. A handful of ogres dashed towards him, the others looking around with fear.\"RAAAHHHGHHH!!!\" He roared in anger, his sword slicing the nearby ogre's body in half at an upwards diagonal formation to the left of him, the body flying against the wall as he hurled his sword at another, sticking him to the wall. Without hesitation, the hungry ogres devoured their fallen brothers as the more intelligent ones continued to hobble around the storming Thrashnald, kicking into the wall to make rock shatter, roaring again violently as he continuously bashed his fist into the arm of the nearby ogre, who willingly supported himself to take the beating.\u00a0\"RRAAGHH!!!\" He roared one last time, panting heavily with a mighty rage, looking down to his hands as purple and black ooze poured from his right-sided chest. He paused for a moment, cupping under the wound and filling his hand with the falling goop, smearing it over to the table he walked to as the symbols began to glow. \".....get me the crystals..\" He commanded, looking back to the ogres. \"NOW!!!!\" He roared in anger, which they sprinted off to find them among the ogres, killing the one so addicted to the gems with ease as they sprinted back to Thrashnald, who stood there forever with the pouch in his right hand, wrist bent as his arm hung there, turning it to face away from him as he stared at the symbols for quite some time.
