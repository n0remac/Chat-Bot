Wide enough to fit a larger-than-normal carriage, it leads upwards through a natural tunnel of foliage. Eventually, high in the mountains, the road comes to an obstacle. Twin pillars of piled stones flank the road, with an immense log resting atop them. A wrought-iron gate fills the gap between the pillars. On this gate is affixed a sign, which reads, \u201cPrivate property, no trespassing! Danger: lethal defensive measures are in place. There will be no additional warnings.\u201dPassing through this gate, the road winds down into a small valley, and along the shore of a small lake. Nestled between two peaks and surrounded by evergreens, the vibrant aquamarine is placid and still, only a few light ripples disrupting the mirror-like surface. As the road continues on around a bend in the shoreline, a break in the trees provides a stunning view over the water.The natural beauty is not the only thing that draws the eye at this point, however. Across the water, near the end of the lake, a small assortment of buildings cluster around a single large, sprawling, chalet. Piled stone walls create a firm foundation for the log beams and thick boards that frame the chalet\u2019s many vertical windows and support the steep angles of the roof. A large covered balcony faces the lake, and other smaller porches and balconies can be seen on various parts of the house. Triangular windows peek out from under the gables. Smoke rises lazily from several of the chimneys that dot the rooflines. On one corner of the building, huge panes of glass form a floor-to-ceiling window that wraps around the corner. A particularly large chimney rises above this section of the house.Around the chalet, done in the same architectural style, are the outbuildings, which include a carriage house, a stable, several small cabins, a sauna and bathhouse building, and a greenhouse. Narrow flagstone paths run between the entryways of each building.Thick oak doors with wrought-iron trappings lead into the building at several points. Each of them has a small area to hang coats and take off snowy boots just inside the entry-way. The main entrance, an imposing set of double doors facing the forest, leads into an impressive hall. Rough-hewn logs buttress the vaulted ceiling, some three stories above. Polished cedar planks form the floor. Rustic tables along the walls display pottery and other various items. Two woolen blankets, adorned with colorful geometric patterns, hang from one of the walls. Wrought-iron chandeliers hang from the ceiling. On the left and right of the room, wide hallways lead into the other areas of the chalet. At the far end of the room from the door, a grand staircase leads up to the other two stories. Balconies frame the room at each level.A strip of rich, red, carpet runs down the center of the hallways leading off of the entry hall. Off of each hall, doors give access to bedrooms and bathrooms.The bedrooms are comfortably-sized spaces, floored in the same cedar as the main halls and well-provided with all the trappings and furniture one would expect in a bedroom, with a large plush rug cushioning the majority of the floor. Tasteful paintings adorn any walls otherwise undecorated, and a large window provides a remarkable view, no matter the room\u2019s location in the chalet. A small fireplace warms the room.The chalet is formed in three equal sections. The center wing runs parallel to the shoreline, and the left and right wings branch from it at 120-degree angles.In the middle of the hallways in the left and right wings is a small common space. Each of them is slightly different in feel and layout, but a table and chairs, a fireplace, a few armchairs, and a small shelf of cards, games, and books are common features. The second-story common rooms also each have a pool table.At the corner between the left and center wing, the top two stories are given over to one of the primary gathering spaces of the chalet: the main lounge. Floor-to-ceiling windows provide an incredible view of the lake and surrounding mountains. Leather couches and easy chairs dot the floor in several clusters around coffee tables. In the center of the room, a large, square, freestanding stone fireplace crackles invitingly. A well-stocked bar presides over the rear of the room, the counter formed from a slice down the middle of a stout tree, polished to a mirror finish. Hunting trophies adorn the walls. Fur rugs cushion the cedar planking of the floor. Wrought-iron chandeliers hang from the bare roof beams. Against each wall, a suit of plate armor stands silent guard. One of them grasps a halberd, the other holds a sword and shield out in front of him. Where the coat of arms might be were these relics possessed by a noble warrior, there is emblazoned a Midnight Sun logo.In the corner between the right and center wings is a cluster of large rooms. From centermost to rightmost, they are the kitchen, dining room, and ballroom. The kitchen is sizable and modern, and well-equipped to handle the culinary needs of the chalet, even at full capacity.The dining room is a sizable, vaguely trapezoidal room, in the same architectural style of the entry hall and lounge, with a two-story vaulted ceiling. A series of long rustic tables can be arranged to form whatever seating arrangement is desired. On the long wall of the dining room, a wall of windows provides a view of the lake, and several french doors allow access to a long covered porch. Various forms of outdoor seating and a few tables furnish the porch, and small fires burning in copper braziers take away the chill of the air.The ballroom is a square room with exquisite marble flooring. Rich red drapes frame a view of the surrounding peaks through several tall, narrow windows. A small stage in one corner suggests a place for musicians to play.On the third floor of the left wing, there is another set of unique rooms accessed from a single door. This door leads into Naoki\u2019s study. The wood panelling is slightly darker here than in the rest of the chalet. Windows along the far wall let natural light into the room. Under the windows and continuing around the left wall of the room runs a single desk, books littered sporadically on its surface. The proper home of those books is with many of their fellows on the set of bookshelves running part of the right wall, next to a set of organizer shelves and boxes. A circular stand-alone fireplace occupies the middle of the room, along with several exceptionally comfortable-looking armchairs, two circular tables, and dark red upholstered chairs to go with them. Luxurious carpet covers the floor. The whole atmosphere is cozy and inviting, the perfect place to curl up with a book and watch the snow fall outside.A door in the right wall, between the bookshelves and organizers, leads to Naoki\u2019s bedroom, which is dominated by a large four-poster bed that could easily fit four people. The single portal to the outside is a bay window, the shelf of which is large enough to sit in comfortably. The rich carpet from the study continues into this room. Paintings of various sizes adorn the walls, with the exception of one conspicuously bare spot. A small bookshelf, a table and two chairs, a wardrobe, a dresser, and a vanity complete the room\u2019s furnishings. A door in one wall leads to her bathroom, which includes a tub nearly large enough to swim in.On the first floor of the left and right wings are storage areas, containing linens, firewood, food, drink, and other necessities, in sufficient quantity to last comfortably through a long winter with no resupply. In the left wing, were one to open a particular door, they would find themselves in a short hallway terminating in a vault-like metal door.The greenhouse outbuilding is empty at the moment. Beds of dirt lie fallow and the gardening tools slumber neatly in their places. The building is equipped with magically-augmented heating systems to allow a year-round growing season, no matter the outside temperature.The bath house outbuilding contains several changing rooms, a shower area, cold, warm, and hot bath areas, and a sauna. The interior is done in finely-cut wood and blue slate, all prepared assiduously to resist the ravages of soap and water.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/7VXRycW.png"], "html": "<img alt=\"Chalet du Sommet Minuit: Cottage of the Midnight Mountain-top\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/7VXRycW.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/>"}, "post-25150": {"user": "Empress Naoki", "user_num": 607, "timestamp": "1456341545000", "message": "[Enter from The Norkari Mountains with Kate Green, Artemis, a fairy, Skarlet, Francesco d'Artusio, Maelik The Fellblade, Lum'Valia, @klur, Lorelei & Lucia, and Arya Shieldheart]At long last, the great iron carriage approaches The Chalet. The journey took considerably longer than was expected due to the interruption of Rag'Novok, and the sun is just beginning to set as the carriage comes to a halt in front of the gate. Madame Naoki enters the primary compartment with a silver bracelet in hand.Finding the lot of them still asleep, she places the bracelet in Ayra\u2019s hand, carefully as not to wake her. After checking to ensure that Klur is still wearing his necklace, she silently treads back to her forward compartment and shuts the door. Leaping down from his perch atop the carriage, Jax approaches the gate. As part of his training in utilizing magical devices and weaponry, Jax is one of the few who can open the gate's complex system of locks without getting fried. He spends a few minutes there, fiddling with the gate, before he successfully completes his task, and the gate swings open of its own accord. With a slight jostling of the reigns, Stan edges the carriage forward through the gate, and onto the premises. Those who are attuned to magic would almost certainly feel as they are brought into the area of effect of The Chalet\u2019s defensive auras and barriers. All sorts of terribly powerful magic effects and defenses overlap and and thrum with energy. But quietly, like a giant\u2019s breathing in repose. The barriers and defenses take no action on the carriage or its occupants, save for observing their approach, and there are no outward indications, for those who aren\u2019t attuned to magic, that anything is out there besides the snow and the trees. As the carriage winds its way up the driveway, the overwhelming presences fade as they move away from the perimeter barriers. Within the carriage, Naoki sits upright on her knees to peer out one of the portholes. They\u2019re almost there. She allows a portion of her excitement to shine through, bouncing slightly and holding her tail straight upright. As the carriage rounds a bend, The Chalet and lake come into view through Naoki\u2019s window. She nearly squeals. There it is! Right there! Her house! Look at how big and impressive it looks! They\u2019re almost there! She considers calming herself, but decides not to. Artemis and Kate won\u2019t mind her small indulgence. Probably. There it is! The actualization of one of her longest-standing dreams, sitting there by the lake. Her own home, her own castle- without any drunkards, rowdy bar-goers, or flesh abominations in the basement! \u2026 Well, any rude flesh abominations in the basement. Her castle in the sky, now built here, atop this hill, just a few short moments away! A quick message to Stan- the horses trot faster. Breaking away from the window, Naoki turns to consider her fellows in the forward compartment. Kate, Artemis, and that friendly fairy fellow: the best of companions with which to share the house with. Naoki is beaming at this point, welling with feelings of anticipation, satisfaction, and achievement. A few minutes later, the carriage comes to a stop again, this time directly in front of The Chalet\u2019s main entrance. Rising from her perch on the bed, Naoki gently grasps Kate\u2019s hand in her own, and tugs toward the door.

But rather than the normal visitations of torture (upon both himself and others), death, blood and pain he was greeted with a more sickening feeling. He dreamed of growing feeble, his arms sagging down and his magic becoming impotent. He remembered a time in which he was the undisputed head of his sect, taking order only from the Prince above him and meting out harsh punishments upon anyone who dared defy him. He remembered fearing no man, woman, beast or angel in his dominance over everything he could reach.He remembered the times when he was backed into a wall and was forced to fight seriously. He never lost once.He awoke with a start, still feeling the phantom pain of his once missing leg but disregarding it as an unnecessary expenditure of mental energy. His rubbed his eyes and shook himself free from the dread that had come over him and making a promise to himself that he'd never allow that dream to reach reality.He stretched his arms out and with a yawn he'd look upon the sleeping forms of his current company, it was a mixed bag of emotions that swirled within him and he wasn't entirely sure how to handle it all.But one good look at Lum was all it took to set his emotional turmoil to rest, all the sacrifices he underwent and the physical discomfort that he felt was worth it just to be near her. Maelik reached out and gently brushed some stray hair from the dragoness's face and sighed, he was truly blessed to have come across her, as well as the others around him who tolerated his presence.Once the carriage had come to a stop the demon undid everyone's safety buckles and sorted their packs along the length of his tail. Hoping not to disturb anyone Maelik would carefully lift Lum up out of the seat and into his arms having removed his armor earlier in order to make her more comfortable. He would repeat this with Arya (who would end up cradled in one of his wings), the twins (who would occupy the other one if they were indeed asleep) and Klur who he would gently place in Lum's sleeping arms.With everyone on board Maelik would silently creep out of the compartment and exit the wagon, approaching the Chalet entrance with friends (and more than friends) in tow. The huge mansion was breathtaking, back in Hell they had similarly sized buildings but they were made with defense in mind and lacked the aesthetic beauty that this place displayed.

Remaining mindful of those who still slumber, Naoki speaks softly. \u201cThey\u2019ll bring our luggage in later.\u201dA gust of mountain air sweeps through, bringing with it the biting winter air; Naoki is reminded of the imperfect aspect of The Chalet\u2019s location. Through chattering teeth, she stammers, \u201cL- Let\u2019s get inside.\u201dWithout any further musing or admiration of the building, Naoki leads the way inside, pushing one of the tall wooden doors inward to allow entry to the vestibule. After seeing everyone inside, she allows the door to shut again, closing out the chilly arctic air, and allowing the heating to take full effect. She takes a deep breath outward, and spends a moment reveling in the warmth. However, with a speed of excitement, she quickly moves to the inner door, and pushes it inward to allow the group entry into the primary entry hall. Rough-hewn logs buttress the vaulted ceiling, some three stories above. Polished cedar planks form the floor. Rustic tables along the walls display pottery and other various items. Two woolen blankets, adorned with colorful geometric patterns, hang from one of the walls. Wrought-iron chandeliers hang from the ceiling. On the left and right of the room, wide hallways lead into the other areas of the chalet. At the far end of the room from the door, a grand staircase leads up to the other two stories. Balconies frame the room at each level.She stops there in the doorway for a moment, overcome with the magnificence of the hall. It\u2019s a brand new level of \u2018holy wow this is my house\u2019. Conveniently enough, the door clicks into the open position with some manner of clever latch, leaving Naoki to peruse the hall. She stumbles in awkward circles, spinning around in an attempt to digest all of the sights to be seen, gaze darting around the room, resting for only a moment on each feature, mouth slightly agape. Rugs and books and sofas and art and chandeliers and it\u2019s so warm! Glancing back toward the vestibule, she remembers Maelik\u2019s heavily laden state. She should probably do something about that first. After taking a moment to orient herself, she gestures in the direction of one of the wide hallways, and beckons for the group to follow her. She sends a mental message to those members of the group that are currently conscious. \u201cMost of the bedrooms are down here, in this wing. Every bedroom is marked with a golden doorknob, and if there\u2019s not a name on the door, it\u2019s unoccupied. Feel free to select any unoccupied bedroom as your own, spend as much time perusing as you\u2019d like. Maelik, I\u2019d suggest that one there for your group there- at least temporarily. It has enough beds, though you personally might not find the taste in decorum to be to your preference.\u201dTrusting the others to find their way to someplace comfortable, Naoki again takes Kate, as well as Artemis by the hand, and attempts to lead them both down to the end of the hall of bedrooms, where a single door sits separated, slightly wider, and made of another sort of wood compared to the rest. Three silver plaques sit side by side, each engraved with a name, the very same names as those three who now stand before the closed entryway. Naoki raises a hand as if to reach for the knob, but finds it as she left it, grasping Kate\u2019s hand.

He did however notice that Klur was beginning to fidget and worried that he would cause a fuss and wake everyone up, only to find that the adorable little fella was already dozing back off. But by lord did he end it in a weird position. That will have to be seen too before too long.The demon nodded after hearing Naoki out and promptly entered the room, and she wasn't wrong about his distaste of the room. It was bright, there wasn't a great deal of space for him to maneuver about between the beds, and there was a distinct lack of sharp spiky things! But for his purposes it would do.There were more than enough beds here to fulfill his needs and one by one he'd stop off at a bed and tuck everyone in tight. First up was Klur, and that was simply enough as he was a small child and his tail could comfortably wrap around him and what little magic he could muster would readily fold the sheets back and stuff him in snug as a bug.After that came Lum who was already wearing very little and Maelik figured that she would be fine to sleep in what she had on, so with extra special care he opened the sheets and set her into the bed. Rolling the blankets back up he'd watch her for a moment and summon an imp, quietly commanding it to crawl down into the blankets and under the sheets and make its way to the foot of the bed. Once there he'd order it to start producing heat so that Lum would have the utmost comfort that Maelik could provide, and he made it clear that failure to comply would be met with extreme consequences.Satisfied that his will would be done Maelik moved to the next bed and set Arya down upon it. This one was going to be tricky as she was set up in armor, and knowing from experience that armor could be difficult to remove at times. So Maelik would slowly, carefully pick up the paladin's limp arm and use his magic to remove the buckles and clasps that held it in place. Assuming that nothing went awry he'd repeat the process with every other piece of her armor until she was left in whatever undergarments she wore underneath. After silently putting the armor on the ground in the center of the room the former Lord would then settle her into her own bed, fluffing up the pillows and being careful not to make it too tight in case her injuries weren't entirely healed yet.Lastly would come the twins, and with equal care he'd remove them from his other wing and plop them into a bed of their own to be tucked in nicely. If they showed that they were awake however Maelik would urge them to keep it quiet and give them his blessing to go and explore, making sure that they understood what he expected from them. No accidents, no stalking, no spooping. They were to be on their best behavior and if they managed it he'd play a game with them later. After he made his stance crystal clear Maelik would simply shoo them away out of the room. Now being the only conscious one left in the room (he didn't count the imp) Maelik would sit himself next to Arya's armor and started polishing it, using the kit he normally reserved for maintaining his own gear. He was already up and even though he felt weakened and drowsy he refused to allow himself any more rest, in fact he was determined to not get a wink of sleep for the entirety of this vacation!He couldn't protect his Lum well enough in that last battle. He was weak! He needed discipline! This was merely one of the many trials he had set up for himself in order to toughen up.His furious state of mind inevitably led to a furious pace and Arya's armor would be sparkling clean, dent free and clear of scorch marks in less than ten minutes. Now what was he to do?What was once a question of legitimate merit was soon reduced to a mere musing as Maelik silently crept about the room to baby proof whatever edges he came across. In addition he lit a nice vanilla scented candle, cleaned the place, and changed into a more casual attire of a loose fitting silken robe. Lastly he began work on a secret little project that he even went to the trouble of taking into the corner and blocking the view with his body in order to avoid detection if one of the others woke up. It was the beginnings of a dress that he was sewing, a colorful bright yellow sundress, not too long but hardly skimpy, just something that he figured would be comfortable to wear. It was going to be his first attempt as sewing and it would be clear to tell as he kept stabbing himself with the needle by accident as he tried to stitch the hems together, not to mention flower pedal made of fabric that he tried to put in at the left breast area. That one gave him more pricks on his thumb than he could reasonably count!Eventually he grew tired of doing that as well, and put the half finished dress away in favor of simply sitting down on the floor and closing his eyes to meditate, to really connect with the inner Maelik. He had quite a few questions he'd like to ask him.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Lum and the others were not to be bothered by the chilly air as Maelik stepped into the halls of the chalet, one of the perks to being in the presence of a demon was the constant warmth that emanated from his body."}, "post-25619": {"user": "Kate Green", "user_num": 567, "timestamp": "1456493276000", "message": "The warmth surrounding them inside the Chalet\u00a0was indeed a welcome change.

A freestanding fireplace and multiple couches, chairs, and tables furnish the room; thick fur rugs line the floor in strategic places. The hues of the oak and cedar boards panelling the room are darker than in the rest of the chalet, but lighter by several shades than the mahogany and dark oak scheme of the Midnight Sun. The walls are tastefully adorned with paintings. In one corner of the room sits an unusual furnishing - a tree. A quarter of the top portion of a mighty oak, where the branches start, has been felled, trimmed, treated, and placed in the corner. Thick limbs, stripped of bark and cured, run into the room, rising and spreading to meet the angles of the ceiling, where they are continued in a masterful mural depicting a view of the night sky from under a bare-limbed tree. Several forks and some of the more horizontal branches look like they would be particularly well suited to sitting on. Small magical lamps hang on strings draped among the branches, glowing and twinkling like little stars.There are five doors in the walls of this central room - three on the left wall, as viewed from the door, one on the right, and one on the far wall. The three doors on the left lead into comfortably-sized rooms containing a couch, a table and two chairs, a wardrobe, a dresser, a chest, and a vanity. The walls are bare, and the rooms are simple and uniform in their appearance, like they were designed to be personalized. With that touch of life not yet administered, however, they feel overly clean and thoroughly unlived in.The door in the right wall leads to the study. A line of windows along the far wall overlooks the lake and lets natural light into the room. Under the windows and continuing around the left wall of the room runs a single desk, books littered sporadically on its surface. The proper home of those books is with many of their fellows on the set of bookshelves running part of the right wall, next to a set of organizer shelves and boxes. A circular stand-alone fireplace occupies the middle of the room, along with several exceptionally comfortable-looking armchairs, two circular tables, and dark red upholstered chairs to go with them. Luxurious carpet covers the floor. The whole atmosphere is cozy and inviting, the perfect place to curl up with a book and watch the snow fall outside.The door in the far end of the common room leads to the bedroom, which is dominated by a large four-poster bed, hung with red velvet curtains, that could easily fit four people. In the middle of the back wall, a large bay window, the shelf of which is large enough to sit in comfortably, provides a stunning panoramic view of the mountains, forest, and lake. The window is flanked on either side by a small fireplace flattening the corner of the room. The rich carpet from the study is duplicated in the bedroom. Paintings of various sizes adorn the walls, with the exception of one conspicuously bare spot. A small bookshelf, a table and two chairs, a wardrobe, and a dresser complete the room\u2019s furnishings. A door in the right wall of the bedroom leads to the bathroom. Done primarily in blue slate with dark paneled walls, the main feature of the bathroom is a tub that\u2019s very nearly large enough to swim in.There is a door in the right wall of the bedroom which is currently locked, although no keyhole is visible.Artemis enters the room, and is immediately transfixed by the physical manifestation of her and Naoki's dreams. Her usual decorum all but forgotten, she bounces from room to room. She knows this suite well, almost down to the inch, from countless hours spent dreaming it up, but she nonetheless runs around like a child, verifying everything with her own eyes and running her fingertips along things, as if reassuring herself that they actually did exist.\u00a0When she finally runs out of rooms to look into, she runs up to Naoki, and wraps the other woman in a tight hug. If Kate happens to be nearby, she would be swept up in the embrace as well. Tears play at the corners of Artemis' eyes, a deliriously happy grin lights up her face. \"We finally did it, Naoki.

We stuck around in some places more than others, and on some occasions had a roof to sleep under, but nowhere to call home. One of our favorite topics to discuss, as we were sitting under the stars for the hundredth time over, was what our house was going to look like.

However, as Kate dismounts and covers herself, Naoki turns her lower lip upward in a pout, and considers the door of the bedroom with an eye of irritability. What could be so important at this time of the morning, to warrant ruining that perfect moment? It probably wasn\u2019t intentional on Skarlet\u2019s part- whatever it is is probably pretty important, but still.Propping herself up in bed, Naoki takes just a moment to send a message to Skarlet, making it clear that she would need to wait for a moment, before facing Kate and beginning to clarify.\u201cI can explain, that\u2019s Skarlet, out there. A few weeks ago, on one of my trips to The Citadel, I brought Skarlet to get her citizenship paperwork done; she wasn\u2019t a legal citizen until that day. Apparently, vampire age doesn\u2019t take into account the age of the individual before they became a vampire, and, as it turns out, Skarlet is technically just over one year old, having only become a vampire about this time last year.\u201d\u201cAnd, as I learned, it seems that persons under the age of eight cannot file for independent citizenry in Isra without a parent or guardian. So I adopted Skarlet, became her legal guardian, and completed her citizenship paperwork under that understanding. Doing so was faster and easier than getting an independent approval for her unique case, and it means that she\u2019s tax-deductible now, so that\u2019s nice.\u201d\u201cTo further clarify, Skarlet isn\u2019t my biological child- none of those exist, and I haven\u2019t asked her to call me \u2018Mother\u2019; she\u2019s doing that herself. To be honest, the familiarity still seems a bit strange to me, especially seeing as how even though she may only be a single year old, her intelligence and body far outpace her age, and she\u2019s essentially as tall as I am\u2026 But\u2026 I think she finds it comforting, and considers me a maternal figure beyond the legal guardian status. I don\u2019t mind it much, and I empathise, it\u2019s a strange and terrible feeling- not to have all of your memories. If she\u2019d like to lean on me as she establishes herself and her identity, that\u2019s fine, and I\u2019m happy to do what I can for her. At least I don\u2019t have to change her diaper, you know?\u201dFinished with her thought, Naoki raises her arms up above her head and stretches, pulling on one with the other. As she does so, she looks around and sighs, still very pleased with the state of affairs. \u201cAnyway. I had planned to tell you all that and introduce the two of you sometime today. I had my mouth full last night, I think you\u2019ll remember.\u201dNaoki launches Kate another smirk, slowly running her tongue across her lips in lewd clarification.

There\u2019s still the matter of the door, though. The outer door of the suite is locked eighteen times over. For as capable as Skarlet is, the door wasn\u2019t designed to be possible to force open. However, there is a solution. One that doesn\u2019t involve getting up. Though the telepathic capabilities granted to her by the earring, Naoki reaches out to make contact with the rudimentary consciousness of the door. By imbuing the door\u2019s internals with some of the same magical constructs one might use to animate a golem, Reese had managed to give the door a manner of consciousness. Consciousness enough, at least, to accept commands and act on them. Though this is the first occasion she is attempting to interface with an artificial consciousness, Naoki manages to will the door open. Over the course of a half minute, the locks disengage one by one, and the thick door creaks slightly as it swings inward, admitting Skarlet to the common room. With the heavy door out of the way, Naoki calls out to Skarlet, \u201cCome on in, and shut the door behind you.\u201dFiguring it a reasonable idea to at least start the conversation with some semblance of decency, Naoki pulls the blanket up over her chest and holds it in place under her armpits.

The stumbling answer and pause followed by more coherent speech indicated she was trying actively to regain control of her faculties. The content of her answer was promising. 'Finding myself' and similar journeys of self-discovery usually corresponded with a more flexible set of values, and a mindset conducive to trying new things. The thought given her answer and her manner of presenting it indicated that the content was something she had told to few people, was not in the habit of volunteering, or was otherwise somewhat personal. Excellent, a subconscious perception of intimacy was invaluable.Now, how to proceed? Arya's ending statement provided an excellent opportunity to make her move now. If she misread the situation, however, coming on strong could hurt later attempts. Pulling back was also an option, and likely the safer one. She could keep the pressure on with small flirting actions, laying the groundwork for future encounters. That approach did risk wasting the turbulent emotional state generated by the novelty of their current situation, though. Sometimes, in the heat of a new interaction, people will do things they wouldn't do when emotionally sober, as it were. If that energetic barrier is breached, increasing intimacy with subsequent interactions becomes much easier. Decisions, decisions... A trickle of adrenaline enters Artemis's bloodstream, setting her heart beating just a little faster, as the thrill of the most challenging hunt in the world fills her.Her choice is made.Artemis steps forward, closing the remaining gap between them. Her arms slip around Arya, left hand going to the small of her back, right hand to between her shoulder blades, subtly halting any small attempts to pull away as she draws close to the other woman, barely making contact between their torsos.

She suspects that some manner of magical effect is in play, either to pre-heat the robe within the closet, or perhaps to bestow an additional warming effect to the wearer. Regardless, Naoki finds the robe to be a truly excellent piece of clothing, and after tightening the belt to achieve a reasonable level of modesty, Naoki gives Kate one parting smile before slipping out the door and shutting it behind her.

I\u2019m not angry, but I want to do everything in my power to stop you from making a decision without enough information to properly identify and understand the ramifications of your actions. Remember, you have all the time in the world. Always take things as slowly as you need to; take all the time necessary to do things correctly the first time. It\u2019s better to do things slowly and properly, and have no regrets, than to make lots of poorly deliberated mistakes that you will regret later. To help with that, it\u2019s always good to do research before you embark on any large undertaking, you can\u2019t make an informed decision without information. I\u2019ll always be happy to share my accumulated knowledge with you.\u201dReaching over Skarlet\u2019s shoulder to reach the book on the desk, Naoki flips around some, attempting to locate a particular page. \u201cSo, judging from the noises you two make, I think I can skip the portions related to sexual intercourse; you seem to have a handle on that. That\u2019s the first step in the human reproductive process, the intercourse. You should note here, that all of these things I\u2019m about to say, they only apply to the traditional, human method of reproduction. The process is very similar with some other animals and races of humanoid individuals, but this information is only fully applicable to humans, as they do their business regularly.  Additionally, there are other ways of going about reproduction. Ways that utilize magic, work between different species, don\u2019t require a second individual. There exist lots of wacky and wonky non-traditional methods of reproduction and creating sentient beings that I\u2019m not going to cover- just be aware of that.\u201dAt this point, Naoki has located the page she was looking for. It contains a really excellent diagram of the human female genitalia, labeled neatly with small numbers that correspond to medical terms in a key on the right. \u201cAnyway, this book you\u2019ve chosen, this is a really excellent book. It contains essentially the sum of all modern knowledge as it pertains to medicine. Very thorough, very up to date, this is a brilliant source. This here, this is a diagram of the female genitalia. You figure, the man enters like this\u2026\u201dNaoki uses her finger to overlay the diagram with a crude representation of the male genitalia. \u201cAnd he does his business, and expels that sticky white stuff right into here, this area. As it turns out, surprisingly enough, the sticky white stuff actually has a purpose, beyond just being there to provide natural lubrication. A properly functioning set of female genitalia will take that substance, known medically as \u2018sperm\u2019, and pull it into here, around through here, and use it to fertilize the egg.\u201dAs Naoki continues to explain the process, she gestures around the diagram and to the corresponding terms in the key to illustrate.\u201cYou see, eggs aren\u2019t limited to birds and such. Humans use eggs too, but they keep them within the body. The sperm heads up here, and usually just fertilizes a single egg. If it does more than one and nothing untoward happens, that\u2019s when you start to get twins and triplets and such. Over the course of a short while, the fertilized egg is moved from here, to over here, and then up into the womb. In the womb, a lot of rather complicated processes take place to change and grow the egg into an infant, which is then birthed. Then you\u2019ve got a newborn baby.\u201dShe thinks back over her explanation, and thinks if there\u2019s anything to add. \u201cThat\u2019s an extremely simplified explanation, but it\u2019s accurate to the best of my knowledge. To be honest, I haven\u2019t read extensively into the subject myself, and am not sure exactly how all of the processes work. I\u2019ve obviously never been pregnant myself, and also can\u2019t speak personally to that experience, however, I know that it\u2019s an extremely taxing and stressful process.

Most of it is hers, Naoki's, and Kate's; Maelik and Lum had needed to store quite little, and Skarlet and Francesco weren't exactly moving in. What little does belong to the others is distributed to their rooms by servants. Accompanied by a small cadre of porters, Artemis bears the luggage she is responsible for back to the suite. The suitcases and trunks are placed in the three rooms on the left side of the room. Artemis appropriates the one closest to the door for herself, with Naoki in the middle, and Kate on the far side.After moving things from her luggage to their designated places in her room and generally getting settled, Artemis changes the sheets on the bed, exchanging the thoroughly soiled linens for an equally luxurious - and far cleaner - set. Her jobs done for the moment, she makes her way to the bathroom. Steam soon fills the room as hot water runs into the enormous tub. A handful of small crystals is scattered into the water, releasing a pleasing fruity scent. With her bath ready, she disrobes, and sinks into the water, luxuriating in the soothing warmth.Her mind flies forward several hours, to consider her rendezvous. It was little more than a one-night-stand for her, but it was quite likely to be Arya's first time, and Artemis was not so callous as to disregard that. With that in mind, it was probably best to put a little effort into the occasion. Arya had stated she didn't have any other clothes, and the armor could be an issue. It was relatively flattering, for armor, but it was rather difficult to tear off a breastplate in the throes of passion, and steel wasn't particularly soft. She sends a quick query to Reese regarding the status of the gateway. The answer she receives is quite satisfactory; the way will be opened within an hour or two. She ponders for several minutes, then sends a request to Reese that some articles of clothing be sent through soon after the gate is opened, along with her approximation of Arya's measurements, and some suggestions for styling and type.That issue handled, she sinks a little deeper in the water, up to her chin, closes her eyes, and begins to make a mental list of things she'd need to gather from the storerooms before the night.

Bright red, with a ribbon, just like Moe taught! Ah, this bag totally speak my language!Thusly, the accessories were picked, but there was still the question of the main course, that is, the dress. This one. The pink one, obviously. Kate was seeing pink, thinking pink, feeling pink. She slid right in, the hourglass shape finding its place on her curves. It wasn\u2019t surprising to her that the dress suited her like a glove. There? I\u2019m done, right?No\u2026 Something was missing. The dress alone didn\u2019t have the bam-effect she was craving.

She completes her spiral by leaning in close to give Kate a peck on the cheek, before stepping back to lean in the doorway. She takes another long look, and sighs a bit.

After Kate\u2019s back is turned, Naoki turns to Artemis, shuts one eye, and gives a thumbs-up instead of responding mentally. As they traverse the halls, Naoki\u2019s attention is split evenly between the slightly bouncing folds of pink fabric before her, and the house around them. Overcome again with wonder, she can\u2019t help but avert her eyes to take in some of the sights. Though the interior of the suite had been planned to the last detail, the rest of the expansive establishment was left almost entirely to the discretion of that drugged up architect, and is unknown to Naoki beyond the floor plan. On the way to their destination, the group passes a large spiral staircase, presumably leading to the upper floors. In addition to the masterful marblework in the floor, a large, red gemstone, perhaps the size of a volleyball, can be seen swinging back and forth in the area between the stairs, held up by a cable stretching up to the ceiling. Noaki diverges from the group for a moment to investigate, approaching the staircase to get a better look. Glancing first upward, Naoki confirms that the cable is attached to the ceiling, or more accurately, the center of a large, domed skylight. The gem itself does indeed seem to be exactly that, and Naoki recognizes its motion as that of a pendulum. A three story Foucault pendulum, where the bob is a ruby the size of her head. What even\u2026 The sheer absurdity of the thing brings a smile to Madame Naoki\u2019s face as she turns her back on the staircase to rejoin the group. How unnecessary. How lavish. What a strange thing to have in one\u2019s home. How many people, Naoki wonders, can truthfully claim to own a pendulum of any sort? Not many, that\u2019s for sure. Regardless, she maintains her position behind Kate for the duration of their walk, not wasting any more of the ogling opportunity. When they arrive at the room where Lum and Maelik had slept, Naoki casts an eye and an ear around in an attempt to locate the pair.

With his usual gruffness he snatched the kid up in a proper hold and with Lum by his side he'd casually meander over to the kitchen.If nothing else Naoki should be proud of the marvel she had for a kitchen, the dimensions and shining utensils fascinating the brutish beast in such a way that he had no words to describe it.Popping his elbow he's snap Klur up into the air towards Lum in an assumption that she'd catch him before solemnly manifesting his cooking hat. This is where the real magic is!Seeing as it was a chalet and this was supposed to be a relaxed vacation Maelik thought it best to make their first meal here a brunch, mostly because brunches were 'awesome.' And what brunch would it be without a gambit of difference breakfast foods to choose from! So his first preparation was going to be the creation of the pancake/waffle batter which was a simple enough procedure giving the ample provisions that the estate provides.The mixing and churning of the batter was a simple thing and would hardly require much thought on the demon's behalf so he'd delegate that duty to his wings whilst he procured, cut and finally laid the bacon to sizzle on a pan. But mere bacon strips were not sufficient, there needed to be even more meat! So in addition to the vindictively popping bacon Maelik added some sausages and ham slices, allowing them to cook in the bacon grease for added flavor.Up next was of course the Gauldish toast, another simple dish that didn't really leave much room for intricacies as all it really entailed was the whisking of eggs and an application of butter. All in all the whole thing didn't really leave much wiggle room for Maelik to deviate from the traditional recipe but sometimes it's best just to stick with the classics.Within moments the smell of his completed work of art filled both the kitchen and the hallways beyond, and he stacked the platters on both his hands and his wings in a precarious balance.\"Well then my dears... Let's sort out where the dining hall is so I can put this down shall we?\" he said with a smile that nearly took in his whole face.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Maelik wouldn't have taken no for an answer anyways, Klur was going to get food in him and that was that.

Though she has a rudimentary understanding of the layout and looked over some of the material invoices, the full extent of the chalet\u2019s accommodations are largely a mystery still. Since Kate has already taken her by the arm, Naoki wastes no time in leading the way from the relatively dull confines of the bedroom, out into the hallways. As they walk, Naoki thinks back to what Kate had mentioned being interested in seeing the previous evening. The pool, the greenhouse, and then a meal. Hm. The pool probably wouldn\u2019t be the best first stop, because to use it, they would have to disrobe and go through the processes of drying and such to move forward. That could come later, Naoki thinks. For now, she steers in the direction of the greenhouse, toward the rear of the center wing. Along their path through the halls, the group passes by a great many closed doors and alternate paths. Like a great sprawling maze, the chalet presents its expanses of comfort and coziness at every turn. As tempting as it is to simply bounce around, wandering without any real aim from one interesting fixture to the next, Naoki refrains. There would be time for a thorough, methodical exploration later; her current objective is simply to have an excellent time with Kate. Consulting her understanding of the floor plan, Naoki notices a shortcut they could take. She leads the group up to a tall set of finely decorated double doors, and begins to push one open with her unoccupied hand. \u201cLet\u2019s cut across the ballroom\u2026\u201d Naoki\u2019s words lose their driving force as the ballroom comes into full view. Six silver chandeliers hang at regular intervals from the ceiling three stories above. However, they are unlit, instead allowing light to filter in through the tall windows along the left wall, and the cloudy glass skylight, lighting the room naturally. Across from the windows, as well as directly across from the door our party is looking through, identical sets of ornate wooden doors sit closed. It isn't difficult to envision a band of musicians playing a waltz, and the ballroom filled with fabulously dressed couples, dancing away in the dead of night. Even now, visions of what could be accomplished in this setting, especially so in regards to Kate, and especially so in regards to dancing, begin to dominate the forefront of Naoki's mind.She stops on the threshold- one arm still holding the door open, as of yet unwilling to take a first step onto the polished stone floor.

Would've saved me some awkwardness.\" Kate shrugged. \"Well, you're pretty much in the position to have a birthday every day of your week, if you like.\" It was a poor attempt of lightening the situation, but it was all she could do for now."}, "post-33694": {"user": "Empress Naoki", "user_num": 607, "timestamp": "1460971850000", "message": "As it just so happens, a short way down the hall, a wide bench is clearly visible.

After a long pause and a deep sigh, Naoki begins to speak. \u201cAlright. I\u2019ll look forward to that. Bear with me here, I haven\u2019t articulated any of this before.\u201d\u201cKeeping in mind what I mentioned a few minutes ago, the first memories that I can recall occurred just slightly over ten years ago. If I recall correctly, once I had figured out what dates were, I placed my first memories in early May or late April. Regardless, to the best of my knowledge, there haven\u2019t been any sort of disruptions since then. I feel as if I remember all events from then until now, without any gaps or obvious tampering.\u201d\u201cWith that said, I suppose that day is the only starting point I have. On that very first day of my memory, I remember, I remembered nothing. Thinking back on it, it was the strangest sensation\u2026 I was considering the world for what was, either literally or effectively, the very first time. It was an alley. Between two buildings, an alleyway, nothing particularly special about it. Both ends opened into streets. There were a few broken pieces of wood on one side, a couple rats, one of the buildings had a locked door on one side, and there were a number of other details that I could list, but really aren\u2019t very relevant, save for the fact that they were all completely new at the time. I bumbled around for a while, poking things to see what they were. Looking back on it, I did an awfully lot of things that seem very naive and foolish in hindsight.\u201d\u201cI suppose that\u2019s why it\u2019s hindsight, and it\u2019s called naivety, though. Logically, everyone must have done those sorts of things at the beginning of their lives. Regardless, and again like I mentioned just before, I was hardly an infant at that point. Far from it, I suppose I was about\u2026 one hundred and sixty centimeters tall? Probably something around there; I obviously wasn\u2019t measuring at the time. At that point, I had full motor control, was capable of complex chains of thought, and by all accounts, probably should have been alive for fifteen years or so before then, to be as physically developed as I was at the time.\u201d\u201cHowever\u2026 those first few hours I had, which I spent so foolishly, poking at rocks. Those were the only free hours I had for a long while. Shortly after wandering out into the street, I was\u2026 I was accosted, is what I was. I was accosted by some men who turned out to be working for The Casalesi, a local brothel. After determining that I had no understanding about how anything worked, they wasted no time in chaining me up as one of their girls. Though, I suppose they wouldn\u2019t have really cared if I did. They certainly didn\u2019t care when they stole the other girls. I wasn\u2019t the first to be simply taken off the street, nor was I the last. You see, the city, the mayor of the city, he was a patron. I\u2019ll come back to him, there\u2019s more to say, but let it suffice for now, The Casalesi was free to do as it pleased, as far as he and the city guard were concerned.\u201d\u201cHowever, I still had no idea what was going on at that point. Absolutely no idea. I wasn\u2019t angry with the men for taking me, because I didn\u2019t know any better. When I was told to suck something, I did, because, hey, why not. It was something new. They gave me some food after that. \u2026 I just realized. I had someone\u2019s genitals in my mouth before I had food. That\u2019s pretty\u2026 pretty terrible, thinking back on it like that.\u201d\u201cAnyway. Shortly after being taken into the brothel, they put an earring on me. Not this one, it was really more of a tag than a decorative or fashion accessory. A little scrap of metal, with what I realized later to be a number \u201829\u2019. That was how they referred to me, I was Twenty Nine. Some of the other girls, the ones who had names and families before that, called each other by those names, but without one, I was just Twenty Nine.\u201d\u201cOver the next few months, I did pick up a number of basic skills, alongside my considerable- even at that point, sexual aptitude. Language, speech, social skills. The sorts of things children learn in their formative years. I learned very quickly, though. Still do. I achieved a fairly functional social skillet after only a handful of months observing others, making sense of, and mimicking their behavior. I\u2019ve come to the understanding that my mind, my ability to remember things, in particular, is quite acute. I can recall for you all sorts of entirely inconsequential details about things, simply item I was aware of at the time. The number of steps up onto the stage, seven. The patterns of cracks on the walls, what sorts of things each man liked most. Generally speaking, if I fix my attention on something, I can later recall all that I noticed about it at the time. I understand that this isn\u2019t quite normal. Most people tend to forget little things, minute details that aren\u2019t worth remembering. I don\u2019t, though. I can\u2019t quite say why, I would seem to simply work that way.\u201d\u201cTo be honest, I really can\u2019t imagine how it must be to unwillingly forget things. To wake up one day, and not quite remember everything you did the day before. To not remember memorable occasions, or slowly forget important details about people or things you\u2019ve done. I mean, you all certainly seem to get on well enough without the full extent of your memories, but I simply can\u2019t understand it.\u201d\u201cI suppose it\u2019s something of a mixed blessing, though. On the one hand, it\u2019s immensely useful, or at least seems that way to me.  Everything about the way I operate is based on knowing all of the things I do. I attribute my relatively rapid learning to it, for one thing. My collection of available data to think back on and analyse is simply larger than most others. It\u2019s also quite nice to be able to recall details with ease. For example, our first meeting. You were wearing a brown coat with a hood, over a woolen blouse. You were a bit frightened at first, but I was burning some relaxation incense at the time, and you were very affected by it. I remember each and every word you\u2019ve said to me, every time we\u2019ve touched, and all of the things we\u2019ve done together. You and I, we\u2019ve already created a considerable number of memories to cherish, and I can recall each one as if it happened only moments ago.\u201dThe hand on Kate's shoulder squeezes briefly, and Naoki takes a few moments, presumably in reminiscence before continuing.\u00a0\u201cHowever, they're indiscriminatory, my memories. Indiscriminatory, and complete. I can\u2019t forget things, even if I\u2019d care to. I remember the face of each and every individual I was forced to pleasure. The things they said, the actions they took, every time I was beaten, all of it. I spend an awful lot of time thinking about my past. Easily too much time. For as much as I have preached moving forward, not dwelling on the past, and living in the present, I can\u2019t help but remember. In my own mind, it\u2019s almost as if I\u2019m looking at two things at once. What\u2019s happening around me, and something from my past. Often, I\u2019ll see something I\u2019ve seen before, an object or an action, and it\u2019ll call to mind some sequence of events from years ago, with all of the detail I remember. I have more control over this than I did, but I still can\u2019t fully prevent it. I\u2019ve become fairly proficient at moving past this, functioning fully in the present, but I still can\u2019t help but almost continually remember the past. Considering that the majority of my memories are far from pleasant, it\u2019s not quite ideal.\u201dThere\u2019s another long pause as Naoki considers her thoughts on the topic further, considering hypotheticals and formulating a complete opinion. \u201cTake the good with the bad, I suppose, but sometimes, I suppose\u2026 I just consider it plainly for what it is, a mixed blessing. To be completely honest, I wouldn\u2019t be here today if it wasn\u2019t for this uniqueness of my mind. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to do all that I have, wouldn\u2019t be living as comfortably as I am, or be sitting here with you now. I realize that is an immensely empowering trait to have, and as I consider it now, sitting here with you, I don\u2019t think I particularly mind. I would pay a far greater price for you; some traumatic memories aren\u2019t really that bad, as far as things go.\u201d", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Allowing her gaze to drift across the art, Naoki simply sits for a moment, enjoying the closeness, thinking about what Kate said, and formulating her thoughts.

Now, with the meal over and the last rays of the setting sun painting the western sky with burnt orange, it was time for the main course.A small trunk burdens her arms as silent steps take her down the hallways to room 340. Opening the door, she steps in, and surveys her canvas.It wasn't perfect, but then again, what room was? A small amount of seduction potential must be sacrificed on the altar of coziness, she supposes. Setting the trunk to the side of the room, she gets to work. The curtains are drawn almost shut, creating an atmosphere of privacy, while being open enough to alleviate any panicky feelings of being trapped. The furs covering the bed are folded, removed to a far corner of the room, and replaced with a more conventional blanket. Fur wasn't the best surface to get hot and sweaty on. Candles are snuffed and ignited experimentally for a few minutes, as she determines the best arrangement to have lit. When she finishes, the room is bathed in a soft, inviting light just dim enough to lend a hint of mystique and cast accentuating shadows. A bottle of wine and two glasses are placed on the windowsill, for post-carnal enjoyment, or for warming metaphorical cold feet with the flush of alcohol. Several toys are placed in the bedside table, in case they are needed. She doubts that will be the case, though. Virgins usually liked it vanilla.The physical aspects of the room prepared, she reviews her own preparations. She is dressed in the same outfit she donned in the morning, but has freshened herself up, and put on her lucky panties. A faint hint of perfume clings close to her skin.All set. Her preparations complete, she relaxes on the corner bench, taking a moment to appreciate how the boots accentuate the shape of her legs when she reclines with them crossed. She makes a mental note to wear this type of footwear more often. She opens the last item from her trunk - a novel - and begins to read. Arya Shieldheart  should be here soon, but there was no sense in simply sitting here.

No part of it was pleasant, and you\u2019re not going to hear me say otherwise. However, in a strange sort of roundabout way, I am thankful for it. It was horrible, yes, and I would never wish it on any sentient being, but it gave me an unparalleled motivation, a motivation that eventually led to my current situation: surrounded by unimaginable wealth, both material and human. My past did propel me, is propelling me, and you are a part of the dream that has kept me pressing forward through many hard times.\u201d \u201cBut I digress. I\u2019ll spare you the fine details of brothel life from here on out. Suffice it to say, I learned to recognize it for what it was soon enough. A miserable and pitiful state of existence, where I was little more than another cute set of holes. At some point, someone said, \u201cYou can sell a sword or a loaf of bread once, but you can sell a girl a million times.\u201d That\u2019s when the resentment started to breed. I saw so many others whose state of living was so vastly superior to my own. I was as far down on the totem pole as one can get. I wasn\u2019t even a prostitute; I wasn\u2019t paid, or compensated for my efforts in any way. I was simply kept alive and functional. There were no opportunities to earn my freedom, or even higher status as a slave. It wasn\u2019t any sort of meritocracy, no matter how well I did, how much I improved, or how much I was able to accomplish, all I ever earned were extra rations, more blankets, and less beatings.\u201d\u201cPerhaps some of it was envy. I sat on these men, with their round stomachs and clean faces. I removed their fine silken pants, and lit their cigars. I wanted to live as they did: easily and luxuriously. But I could not. The opportunity simply wasn\u2019t available to me. If everyone at the brothel had their way, I would continue to hump wealthy men until I couldn\u2019t any more, or became undesirable, at which point I would be cast out into the street, likely to be killed or starve to death. I had seen it happen on numerous occasions. The girls, all very concerned with their appearance. When a couple wrinkles or a nasty scar means almost certain death, you tend to get very concerned about those sorts of things. Getting old, getting saggy, loosening up, these were all concerns in the forefronts of our minds. \u201c\u201c... I may have lost track of where I was headed with that. Oh, yes, resentment. I grew to hate life. I learned to hate my oppressors, the place where I was kept, the men I was forced to serve, the food I was given, all of it. This resentment grew and intensified with each day, and on multiple occasions, I considered taking my own life. I had seen that happen, too. Not every girl was able to cope with the brothel life. None enjoyed it, but after a while, some simply\u2026 broke. One morning\u2026 One morning I woke up, and my cellmate had hung herself in the night by her blanket. I\u2019ll always remember the way she was slowly spinning\u2026 It seemed as if her dull, glazed eyes were staring at me. She was removed promptly by a guard, dragged by the hair like a sack of meat. I don\u2019t know what they did with her, but I have no reason to suspect a respectful burial or cremation.\u201d \u201cAnd sometimes I would think. I would think, \u201cGee. What an unequivocally awful life I\u2019ve been dropped into. Sure do wish it would hurry up and be over, already.\u201d A few knots tied in the dark of night, and it would all be over. I would no longer have to deal with any of it. There would be freedom in death. Maybe there was an afterlife out there somewhere that would take pity on me. Maybe reincarnation was a thing that happened, and I\u2019d have a better experience the next time around.\u201dNaoki shrugs, some of the indifference filling her life at that point in time bleeding through into the present. . \u201cI obviously never went through with it, but I\u2019ll not falsely say I\u2019ve never considered the notion seriously. I like to think what motivated me not to was envy, and greed. Envy for those who led a better life than I did, and wanting to live that way myself. I wanted to live comfortably, eating the food I wanted, sleeping with who I chose  and nobody else. Somewhere, in words and concepts I had never yet heard, I knew I wanted  to spend my life with someone I genuinely loved.\u201dThe hand on Kate\u2019s shoulder squeezes again, and amber orbs flick past Kate to Artemis for a moment.\u201cAnyway, to that end, I came to understand that I needed to improve myself to reach such a position. I was aware enough to realize that I was unaware of many things, and I was intelligent enough to know  that to improve my position, I first needed to improve myself. To bend the world to my will, I first had to understand it.\u201d\u201cOpportunity came in the form of a portly man. At the time, I knew him only as Mr. P. His profession was that of a stationer. He created and sold books. One one occasion, Mr. P left one of his books behind. I was able to steal it, and spent that night reading it. It was a book about religion, and didn\u2019t really give me any useful or applicable information, besides a bit of context for the things some of the men would shout. When next I was made to see Mr. P, I returned the book, and managed to\u2026 to bribe and coerce him into leaving me another book to read. This arrangement carried on for quite a while, and I was able to absorb quite a substantial sum of information from his books. I read of love and war, politics and religion, anything that he would give me. My understanding of the world deepened immensely through the lense of literature,  and though I never quite looked forward to seeing Mr. P, what with his warts, I came to appreciate the service he was doing for me.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s where my passion for books comes from. Through books, I obtained my initial understanding of the world, and have ever since then, I have found them to be an excellent medium through which to grow intellectually. With this newfound information, I began to be able to formulate plans. Strategies. Escape plans. In coming to understand my situation more fully, I was able to identify ways in which the seemingly invincible and omnipotent guards were imperfect, just as human as anyone else, and prone to the same mistakes and vices as any human. I often considered attempting to escape. I was confident that I could get beyond the walls of The Casalesi, but I knew, from that point, I would be little better off than I was, and debatably worse. For as much as I had come to hate my situation and resent the ones who had put me in it and kept me there, they were the same individuals to whom I owed my continued existence to. If food were not provided to me, I would have no way to procure it. If I ran away, I would have nowhere to live, nowhere to be. If I were to leave, I would stop having that level of support, I would stop being someone\u2019s responsibility to keep alive. I knew that I wasn\u2019t capable of self-sufficiency at that point. Not at all, and not to mention the incredibly high chance of my being captured, either by someone who would return me to Casalesi, or one who would force themselves on me, without the need to pay first, maybe even kill me afterwards. No, it wasn\u2019t a viable option yet. Not in my state at that point.\u201dHere, she pauses, and casts a glance at Artemis, as if asking permission. After a moment, she receives a nod, and continues.\u201cOn one fateful day, I decided to test my knowledge in a rather dangerous way. By observing and finding patterns in the stations of the guards, and when their shifts change, I was able to identify the schedule they were operating on, and identify a number of imperfections- a number of holes in it. I decided to test one of these holes by sneaking into the forbidden back areas of The Casalesi. After all, I still had a bit of a reputation as the clueless cat, and even if they caught me, I would probably simply be sent back to my cell with some relatively minor punishment.\u201d \u201cAnyway, as I was sneaking along down the hall, one door in particular caught my eye. Not that it was particularly interesting looking, or obviously of any importance, but  it was somewhat wider than the others, with a strange set of smells coming from under it. I turned the knob and proceeded inside, unaware at that point of how dangerous such an action would have been, if there had been any defensive wards on the room.The room I stepped into was like something out of a bard\u2019s horror story. Jars and strange implements lined the walls, and the air tingled with what I now know to have been magic, and there, in the center of the room, was a steel table, with a woman lying on it. Her chest cavity was cut open, the skin peeled back in huge, obscene flaps, putting her internal organs on full display. Strange gold-bound crystal needles stuck into her body at several places, and shackles pinned her limbs to the table. I was disgusted and dumbstruck. Why would someone cut open a dead body? As far as I was aware, dead bodies were nothing more, simply\u2026 dead. Was this what happened to the girls who couldn\u2019t work anymore? Why was she still restrained, even in death? Curious, I made my way over to the cadaver, and looked at its face. Emerald eyes stared up at the ceiling glassily. Then they moved, turning to regard me with a crazed stare.\u201d\u201cI was\u2026 terribly alarmed, to say the very least but I managed not to call out. After a few moments, I screwed up my courage and went back over to her. Her eyes followed me, slowly taking on a tint of sanity as they gazed. I almost threw up in horror. This girl was, somehow, after all that, alive! Seeing her then, it sort of put things in perspective for me. I thought that I was at the bottom of the totem pole. I thought that I had it as bad as anyone ever did- surely, there isn\u2019t a lot in life lower than that of the slave. But yet, there she was, sitting on the table before me, with even less freedom, even more horrible circumstances. That was probably the first time I experienced pity.\u201d\u201cI had no idea what to do. I wanted to help, but I knew that I couldn\u2019t move her. Even though I didn\u2019t have a very thorough understanding of physiology or medicine at that point, with those wounds and the internals of her body\u2026 open, as they were,  if she got away from the influence of whatever was keeping her alive, I understood that she would die.. There was no choice but to leave her to whatever monsters were doing this to her, and hope she survived. With no other help I could offer, I pressed a kiss to her forehead, looked her in the eyes, and told her to be strong, that she would make it through this, and that I would be waiting for her when she did. With my window of escape closing, I then had to hurry from the room, and back to my cell, leaving her alone again.\u201d\u201cI never got another chance to sneak back and see her. I\u2019m unsure why, or if my little escapade was ever noticed, but the guards changed their routine, closing the weakness I had used before. For weeks, all I could do was wonder what happened to her. If she had died, or been dissected or\u2026 It pained me to consider, but I couldn\u2019t help it. Then, one day, the cell door opened, and the guards roughly tossed in a young woman to take the place of the one who had hung herself the week before, the tiny trickle of blood on her ear under her \u201848\u2019 tag testifying to how recently she had arrived.The door closed, and she turned to look at me.\u201d\u201cAs it turned out, the woman from the table had survived, and was sitting next to me on the floor. After some initial awkward introductions, we began to talk, and she revealed that she had knowledge, but no memories. She could describe the Norkari Mountains, for instance, but she couldn\u2019t form a mental picture of them. She didn\u2019t remember how she got here; she didn\u2019t remember her name. I suppose we were similar, in that regard. However, we didn\u2019t get any further than that before the shift started. The cell opened again, and we were escorted into the main room. On the way, I tried to tell her some things about how the brothel worked, to prepare her for the new torment she was now a part of. That was before she went down on her John like a seasoned professional, finishing him off just before I finished mine. Some small part of me was impressed, but that showing stopped me from trying to tell her any more about how things worked around there. She already knew.\u201d\u201cWhen we were taken back to our cells after \u2018working\u2019, we resumed our conversation over our rations. The topic of names came up again, and she asked me what mine was. When I told her I didn\u2019t have one, only my number and some of the nicknames the men had given me, she insisted that wouldn\u2019t do, and that I must pick a name. I threw my mind back to one of the stories Mr. P had given me, thinking one of the character names would work. That act triggered something, I\u2019m not sure what, and the name Naoki sprung to mind. I\u2019m unsure as to why, the closest character name in the book was \u2018Nami\u2019. When I told her the name, she said that it didn\u2019t sound important enough, that I needed a title. 'Madame Naoki', she proclaimed. I laughed, and said that would work well enough. Then she asked me to choose a name for her. It somehow didn\u2019t seem appropriate to name her after a fictional character - even though I was about to do that for myself - so I recalled Mr. P\u2019s religious text. In that text, the story of one of the angels had struck me. Swift and strong, striking down her foes with unerring precision in the name of her goddess. I told her the name, but asked if she wouldn\u2019t like a last name too.\u201d\u201cIf one name is good enough for you, one name is good enough for me, she replied simply.\u201d\u201cI responded equally simply:\u00a0Well. then let me introduce myself.

This was an exceedingly difficult task, given that I had no memories to lend the information context, but we muddled through it as best we could. The most important thing that came out of those months was that we discovered that I was capable of some forms of magic, an ability which I spent many nights training in utmost secrecy. None of the brothel workers knew I could perform magic, and that fact gave us a glimmer of hope that escape - and survival afterward - might be possible. We bent our minds to the task of searching for a way out; we spent our 'work' hours subtly fishing for pieces of information and looking for holes in the guard schedule, and our rest hours drawing maps in the dust on the floor. Slowly, a plan took form.\u201d\u201cIt was after midnight on a stifling night in late summer when we made our move. We grabbed our moth-eaten blankets and Naoki\u2019s book, the sum total of our worldly possessions at the time, and waited for the guard to pass. A conjuration made short work of the lock, and we were moving, slipping down the hallways on noiseless feet. We rounded a corner, and saw the door. We were almost free! Then, a shout froze the blood in our veins. A guard had discovered the empty cell earlier than we anticipated, and now they were on alert. Stealth forgotten, we dashed for the exit, hoping to make it out and get away before they could stop us. That hope was crushed when a guard stepped into our path, club drawn.\u201d\u201cI hurled myself at him, faster than he expected, and managed to get him in a chokehold. A sharp twist, and it was all over. As his strangled cries stopped and his lifeless body fell bonelessly to the ground, a woman\u2019s scream rang out. My head snapped to the source of the sound, and I saw the owner, flanked by his guards, holding one of the girls by the hair in front of him, with a knife to her throat. Walk out that door and she dies, he said. That was the breaking point. Originally, we just wanted to get away, to sneak out of the town and leave it all behind. When we saw the fear in his hostage\u2019s eyes and the cruelty in his, our objective changed. We were going to make those monsters pay. Every godforsaken one of them would feel the fear we felt, feel some small amount of our pain as they died screaming.\u201dArtemis\u2019s voice is trembling with uncharacteristic emotion, and her words carry a vicious undertone. She takes a moment to compose herself before continuing.\u201cKill them. Naoki\u2019s whisper cut through the air, and I was in motion. His guards rushed to meet me, and I rushed past them, leaving one clutching his torn throat and the other dead before he hit the floor. They never stood a chance, but neither did his captive - I was too slow. As the owner saw his guards go down, the knife across her neck flashed, spilling her life onto the floor. A conjured blade sank deep into the owner\u2019s arm a moment too late, forcing him to release his hold on the knife, and another one hamstrung him. A final blade nailed his other hand to the floor, and I left him bleeding on the ground without finishing him. A swift death would have been too kind for him.\u201d\u201cAs I rushed to the cages to free the girls and kill any remaining guards, Naoki headed to the kitchen. It would be empty now, for sure. There would be no reason for the guards to be protecting it. The coals in the hearth would be just what she needed. She took a jug of oil and broke it against the wood of the walls, then lit it. As the flames rose, she repeated this act, again and again, until the kitchen was a raging inferno. Lighting a torch, she moved through the areas I had cleared, setting fire to anything that would burn.\u201d\u201cI joined her outside, after both of our tasks were completed. We stopped and stared for a few minutes, watching our torment - and our tormenter - go up in flames. As the fire roared ever higher and the group of girls started to disperse, we moved deeper into town. The flames were already starting to spread to the adjacent buildings; the burning brands we carried speeded the grim work as we went. It may seem rather brutal of us, looking at it now with the luxury of morality, to have torched the entire town like that, but there was little doubt that the townsfolk knew of the Casalesi, and did nothing to stop it, to say nothing of the mayor\u2019s more\u2026 direct association. With the village in flames, we cast aside our brands and waited. Soon enough, the mayor and his personal guards appeared, trying desperately to stop the fire from spreading to his manor. I ran up to him, looking like a frantic young woman, yelling for help. In the ghastly light of the fires, it took him a few seconds to recognize me as one of the brothel girls. By then it was too late. His expansive gut spilled to the ground, his blood in death doing more to put out the fires than his body in life. His guards were better trained than the others, though, and ingoing for him so directly, I had inadvertently surrounded myself. I struck quickly, downing one with a thrown blade, but the four others still had me surrounded, and all my element of surprise was gone. With the skill and experience I had then, there was absolutely no way I was going to survive those odds. At least, until a sword burst through one of their chests. Naoki released the blade and staggered back, hands shaking. The shock of their comrade\u2019s abrupt death gave me all the purchase I needed, and after a hard fight, the others soon fell.\u201d\u201cWe left the town, and spent the night huddled together on a hill nearby, clutching our blankets to our chests and watching the flames cleanse our suffering. When we hit the road in the morning, we left behind only desolation, a smoldering ruin of ashes, death, and a few wailing survivors.\u201d\u201cThe years after that contain their fair share of interesting stories, but the specifics of them will have to wait for another time. Suffice it to say that we wandered homeless for a long time. We kept body and soul together through odd jobs where we could find them, and petty theft where we could not, but it was little more than survival. There was a path forward, but none upward. No one was willing to hire two homeless women for anything more than menial labor, eliminating any chance of working our way up to something meaningful. Starting our own business was out of the question due to our lack of capital. Marrying into wealth and power wasn\u2019t an option, as it would involve a long, grueling, and risk-fraught slog through social circles, with precious little guarantee of success - to say nothing of the fact that our success would depend on another, a prospect which didn\u2019t sit well with either of us. Our long-standing dreams of success, of wealth, of prosperity, were firmly out of our reach, barring extensive criminal enterprise or a miracle.\u201d\u201cAfter a moderately successful attempt at starting a criminal organization was shut down, we fled that city, arriving one day at the bones of a city just starting to rise from the ground. A group of people getting a fresh start. Perfect for us. We survived in the nascent Isra for a short time, before fate led us one day to a shitty bar in a ramshackle building. The Midnight Sun, a rickety sign proclaimed. We went inside looking for easy marks, but instead, we found the strange old woman who ran the place. She took one look at us, and said she was getting too old for this, then asked Naoki if she wanted to try running the bar. She jumped at the chance, and I jumped with her. The struggle to keep it going was not easy, at any point along the journey. There were times when we were within a hair\u2019s breadth of having to close up, but we kept going, kept fighting. Grandma gave us a running start to see if we could make it, and, well,\u201d she gestures to their surroundings, \u201cmake it we did.\u201d", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Artemis picks up where Naoki left off. \"I'll skip over the details of brothel life for the next few months.

I never inquired too deeply into her affairs, but I don\u2019t think that I quite understood her motives, and doubt that her motives can truly be understood. I\u2019m thankful that she gave us the opportunity that she did, but I\u2019m not sure why she did so\u2026 The Black Tower, too. She started that, built it up, then disappeared, leaving me with the reins. I don\u2019t know. Maybe she saw something in me - the things that I\u2019ve done, the lives that I have crushed, the ones who have become monsters in my name.\u201d Amber eyes dart to the side, meeting Artemis\u2019s gaze for a split second before returning to the floor. \u201cMaybe she saw that I was just as much of a monster as she was. A suitable successor, even.\u201d A flicker of disgust passes over Naoki\u2019s face.With that stated, Naoki abruptly joins Kate in standing, seeming to have recovered. She manages to force a small smile, and offers an outstretched arm, to be taken, lead into an embrace, or thrown aside as Kate sees fit. \u201cRegardless. They said correctly; thank you for listening. It feels\u2026 liberating, to share that, get it off my chest. Would you like to continue to the greenhouse from here, or\u2026?

When nobody could tell what it was, he read every and any book he could find on flowers. And, well, he never figured it out. But he knew more about the science behind flora than anyone.

One time he hid my favourite toy, a spinning top, and I was shouting at him like mad. He was rolling on the floor, laughing and pointed to my hair. He had tied it to a curl when I was asleep. That\u2019s the sort of dad he was. He liked his jokes practical.\u201d \"I never knew my mother. My father never told me if she was dead, or if she had left us. He would just smile and say: 'Don\u2019t worry. Your mother is happier now.' But I know for a fact, that I have her eyes. He never told me that. I figured it out myself.

But I was too curious about what he was actually doing with all this flora.

It seemed the sunlight represented those moments of pleasure she had experienced; Those moments were bright, and enticing, yet fleeting. Their brightness was blinding, leaving no room for rational thought in their strongest moments.

Regardless, Naoki listens carefully as Kate relates the details of her childhood, retaining each and every word as she tends to. A portion of her mind wanders, attempting to put herself in those metaphorical shoes. To have a parental figure, the mere concept of it is an interesting and foreign one to Naoki. She had been putting more thought into the matter as of late- dealing with Skarlet and all, but to hear Kate refer to her father with such admiration and reverence\u2026 It\u2019s interesting, at the very least. Worth more thought later- should focus on the matter at hand. The note about Kate\u2019s eyes, and her unknown mother is another bit that piques Naoki\u2019s interest. She knows full well that she and Kate seemingly have the very same set of amber eyes. The passing thought that they may be in some way related is mildly off-putting, but highly unlikely, Naoki figures. Well. Who is she to say, she supposes. Too many unknowns to say anything with any degree of certainty. The comment about the other children regarding Kate as abnormal rubs Naoki in entirely the wrong direction. So what if she\u2019s got strangely colored eyes and hair? Who doesn\u2019t, in this day and age? They\u2019re beautiful, dammit. To think that some children were raised so intolerantly as to discriminate based on such inconsequential thing as color\u2026 ugh. Naoki finds it disgusting to think about. Naoki has had a few \u201cfreak\u201d comments leveled in her direction as well, but they were no more justified. Human nature is awful, Naoki muses. She doesn\u2019t understand how some can be so idealistic in the context of human nature when humans so regularly make such a mess about things as inconsequential as the mere color of one\u2019s eyes. Disgust aside however, Naoki again doesn't interrupt. She knows that Kate knows fully well what she thinks of those eyes of hers, and if she was searching for further confirmation, the way in which Naoki\u2019s own eyes are gazing into them ought to be plenty. As Kate breaks into tears, Naoki instinctually extends her arms and leans over to offer her shoulder. Though she hasn\u2019t thought about it consciously up until this very moment, she supposes that it is her job to support Kate in the same way. Everyone needs a shoulder to lean on sometimes, she supposes. Even the likes of these three fools sitting on the bench. She\u2019s cried on Kate\u2019s shoulder on\u2026 quite a few occasions, goodness knows, this small gesture is the least she can do. Naoki attempts to emulate the same warm sort of feel that she herself has been so comforted by in the past, but finds herself without words. The words are the important part, she knows, but how can she be expected to say something comforting when she isn\u2019t even quite sure what\u2019s wrong? Something to do with her father, obviously, but what? Figuring that silence is probably superior to saying something obnoxiously general like \u201cIt will be alright\u201d, Naoki keeps her mouth shut, but attempts to be present and comforting in whatever way she can. For Artemis, at least, simply being there physically is quite enough. In her silence Naoki regrets not adding a kerchief or two to her ensemble; now would be an excellent time for one.

Arya would offer a small smile to Artemis before she left, as if to reassure her that she was alright, to convince her not to worry. \"Goodbye, Artemis,\" and with that she left the room. Arya would make her way back to her own room, where her armor and her sword waited. Here she would abandon the clothes she wore, donning her armor and sword once again. In truth Arya had felt used, and stupid. Like one would feel after falling victim to some sort of scam. Artemis had only wanted to be with her for how she looked, and nothing else. If Arya made a habit of making such connections, what would happen if she lost her own visual appeal? It was obvious what would happen, she would be alone once again.

He was eating a sandwich, mechanically, staring at a wall. When I entered, he smiled. I couldn\u2019t say anything. He touched my cheek and said: \u201cI\u2019m doing this for both of us. We\u2019re going to be alright.\u201d. There were bags under his eyes, his voice wasn\u2019t his own.

Then he left again, leaving behind a mostly eaten sandwich\u2026 I had never felt so conflicted in my life.\u201d\u201cThe six months following that were the most painful in my life. Dad would barely come outside, anymore. I was to bring him his food in front of his door, and knock. Sometimes he would answer. He never allowed me to look in. When the soldiers came, he would hurry down and do the transaction with haste. He wore a brown coat that covered his hands and arms. His hair was tangled and dirty, his eyes were darting. They didn\u2019t shine like they used to. He would look at me and then turn away. Not even\u2026 He couldn\u2019t bare looking at me for longer than a second. So I eventually decided\u2026 I couldn\u2019t bare looking at him like this. So I disobeyed.\u201d\u201cOne morning I made him an omelet and two slices of bread for breakfast. Orange Juice, too.

The fingers!\u201d The image drew a grimace on her face.\u201cI tried talking to him, but no words came. He shrieked and crawled back in like a cockroach. He didn\u2019t look anything like my father anymore. I followed him inside. I had to cover my mouth just to keep myself conscious, the smell was pungent. I could not recognise the place anymore. It\u2019s as if the entire attic had become one big, living, breathing organism. The walls were covered in wild creepers. Father was squatting in the corner, shying away from the light. He was a sorry sight, I chose not to torment him further. His papers were scattered on the floor, patterned geometrically. I didn\u2019t get a good look, but he was using the orange flower, \u201cMagenta Supremium\u201d, as the base for his solution. Then I saw the syringes. There must have been dozens. He was using himself as a subject, and hadn\u2019t told me.\u201d\u201c\u2018I\u2019m growing, Kate.\u2019 he croaked. \u2018They want me to grow more. But it\u2019s getting to me. I thought I could last long enough to provide you for your life, but my body can\u2019t take this.\u2019 I wanted to be angry so bad. But I could not bare to shout at him. I could already see that he was fading away. He told me, head between his knees, that he was sorry, that he had no option, and I listened, and I believed. As his final request, he pleaded me to end his life. He wanted to die in my arms, rather than being consumed by the devilish thing that was feeding on him. I took a letter opener, he always kept it on his drawer, I pressed it against his aorta, I kissed him, on his brow, he smiled, and breathed for the last time.\"\"I heard something fall on the floor. Sunflower seeds, stained with blood. He had them, so I think. I closed his eyes, that was all I could muster at that point. I had done what he had asked, but now I had no one to tell me what to do next. I couldn't let my uncle see him like that. I feared that his disease  would grow if I buried him, so I did the only thing I could. I burned the house, the lab, and hid his notes somewhere no one could find them. Then I ran away. I knew there would be consequences, but I couldn't let them find out what happened.\"\"I started life again here, but no matter how I try, my past still haunts me.

The uncomfortable truth that her lover\u2019s hands were not quite as idealistically clean of blood as Naoki had initially thought. Not particularly enjoyable feelings, any of them. But necessary, like the story itself, and Naoki\u2019s story that preceded it. While not quite as pleasant conversations as, say, the one they shared on the mountain outcropping about the nature of happiness, what with the (excellent) ear fondling and such that came during and afterward, these sorts of conversations are necessary to better understand the other, and deepen the relationship. Even with Naoki\u2019s nascent understanding of relationships wherein one party isn\u2019t trying to exploit the other, this would seem to be the case.  It certainly feels that way, at least. However, within the frothing mix of thoughts and feelings, there is at least one certainty. Managing to maintain a reasonable facsimile of external composure, she gently attempts to pull one of Kate\u2019s hands into her own, and makes eye contact, attempting to channel her highest degree of sincerity into the words, \u201cI will tell no one.

This I promise.\u201dWith that solemn vow given, Naoki returns her focus to processing the information recently bestowed upon her. The concept of loss is still largely foreign to her, and seems infinitely more traumatic than her own story, when presented as such. Loss is something that Naoki can sympathise with and fear, but not something she can truly empathise with; not something she can truly understand, lacking any relatable experiences. Lacking any parental figures, relatives, or other miscellaneous family-like figures, the only individuals who would be truly capable of inflicting lasting grief are- as callous as it feels to admit mentally, sitting right here at the table with her. Others would be missed, and mourned, yes, but would ultimately be gotten over. Remembered fondly, but not constantly. And here, in stark contrast, sits Kate. Who not only had an excellent parental figure, who not only was forced to watch them be not only affected, not only largely consumed by what would sound like some manner of parasite, but to watch them become not themselves. And to take their father\u2019s life, to burn their body, tell no one, and carry the burden completely alone, for\u2026 how long? Probably several years, at this point. And then, on top of all of that, to know that her father did it all apparently out of love for her, and then also to have the lingering fear that the research will be discovered and used on more individuals, robbing them of their\u2026 individuality?Kate wasn\u2019t quite clear on the specifics of the solution\u2019s symptoms, but regardless, the understanding that they were terrible came across quite clearly. Even from a purely objective standpoint, setting aside the personal trauma for a moment, Kate\u2019s greatest fear seems fully justified to Naoki. If that was simply the early stages of whatever parasitic nonsense was at play, and again, if the notes could be believed\u2026 If those notes got into the wrong hands, the likes of Goraia, for example... That would become a massive international crisis in many ways, very quickly. And\u2026 thinking about Kate\u2019s closing words a bit more thoroughly\u2026 was that an offhand proposal, at the very end? ... It sort of was, Naoki supposes.

But those emotions and that prospect that will have to simmer for a moment, because there\u2019s another burning question on Naoki\u2019s mind. One that is, strangely enough, more pressing. Slowly, she voices it with a hint of trepidation, \u201cWhy not destroy the notes?\u201dIt seems like a question that ought to be asked, she figures. It would seem to Naoki that it would simply be common sense to burn the notes right along with the body and the lab. But based on how Kate described the situation, it would be implied that she deliberately removed the notes from the lab to hide them, the reasoning for which is not immediately obvious, and actually seems rather counterintuitive. \u201c... Or... at least keep them somewhere where you can watch them.\u201dThere\u2019s probably some logical reason for Kate doing what she did in regards to the notes, but if her largest fear is them being discovered, would it not make sense to see that they couldn\u2019t be discovered? It may be overstepping her bounds to ask, Naoki knows, but if she doesn\u2019t, the question will linger and grow to nag irritate her, so it\u2019s probably for the best to simply ask it now and not have to bring up the painful topic again later.

Somewhere warm and comfortable. I\u2019m sure you can imagine, my work is rather wearisome, and it\u2019s almost mandatory that I de-stress on a regular basis. One of my favorite places to relax is in the sauna. I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ve ever had the pleasure, but there\u2019s something about the sauna that is truly excellent for my mood. You should definitely try one of ours sometime; perhaps join Artemis and I for a session. She\u2019s an excellent masseur.\u201dUncharacteristically enough, there is no undertone of sultriness in the sauna invitation. After another sip of her drink, Naoki continues, \u201cI also enjoy casual social encounters. Like this one, for instance. I enjoy simply sitting about, speaking with individuals that are enjoyable to chat with. I spend an awful lot of time speaking in decidedly not-causal contexts as part of my obligations. All sorts of officials to meet with, diplomatic encounters and such. So it\u2019s refreshing to sit down with someone like you- without a specific goal to the conversation. I have no agenda to further by speaking with you right now, and that\u2019s a pleasant sort of thing.\u201dFor a moment, she pauses, taking another sip of her drink, and composing her thoughts. \u201cBeyond that, recently, I\u2019ve taken up archery. And I\u2019ve been enjoying that. It\u2019s an elegant sort of thing. It\u2019s good exercise, it\u2019s excellent for one\u2019s posture, and I find it\u2026 again, rather relaxing. It\u2019s easy for me to focus my attention on the singular- if not quite simple task of planting my arrow where I\u2019d like it to go. There\u2019s a lot involved in what seems like a simple enough task. It\u2019s an excellent way to practice self-control, and learn a potentially useful skill at the same time. If you\u2019d like to join me to practice sometime, I would enjoy your company, and you might enjoy the sport as much as I do.\u201d\u201cMy suggestion to you, though, based on what you seem be alluding to there, is to slow down a bit. Settle down. Spend some time to yourself. You\u2019ve been very busy for a long while, now. You should take some time off from your regular world-saving and adventuring to spend some time on yourself. Spend some time in introspection, and figure out what you want to do. Spend a few days here. Be idle. Read some. Relax. Bring your 'cauldron' up here, and maybe boil some things with him. Perhaps set yourself a goal. I always find it much easier to take action when I know what I want. Right now, my three broadest goals are to be the best Lady of Isra I can be, be the best me I can be for my partner, and improve my ability to do both. All of my important plans fall into one of those three goals, and it\u2019s not very difficult to decide what I\u2019d like to do by keeping those three goals in mind and aiming to fulfill them each as well as I can. You should do the same thing.

But still! The metaphor was getting stretched as it is. She could have alluded to something other than his sexual prowess. Naoki hopes, having learned better, for Jun\u2019s sake, the man has something else to offer. That the relationship develops into something beyond whispering sweet, romantic nothings and the occasional roll in the hay. Jun deserves better than just that. But again, and somewhat frustratingly, the matter is tabled for now. Naoki continues listening as Jun goes on, smirking slightly but not making any move to prevent Jun from resting her head where she pleases. \u201cYou might like Kate, then. Gardening is\u2026 that\u2019s her thing. It\u2019s her area of expertise, and her skills in that chosen field of hers are nigh-unmatched. I\u2019ll admit that I am subject to a fair amount of bias, but I\u2019d say she\u2019s the best. There\u2019s a greenhouse\u2026\u201dWith a lazy sort of motion, Naoki waves in a direction off to their left with her mug.\u201cAttached to the rear of the Chalet here, in addition to her primary shop in Isra. She does all sorts of things in there with plants I can\u2019t even begin to identify. \u2026 It\u2019s amazing. When you say the word \u2018gardening\u2019 I think of\u2026 small things. Vegetables. Herbs, little hand-shovels. But she\u2019s got these massive leafy things in there with flowers larger than she is. Vines around every which way, wrapping themselves around anything that stays still for too long. I\u2019m convinced some of the plants are semi-sentient, the way they react to her.\u201dHere, Naoki pauses for a moment. Probably in pleasant recollection, if the light smile is anything to go by. \u201cAs for me\u2026 it\u2019s not quite that I haven\u2019t tried. I have, on a few occasions. It\u2019s just not quite as\u2026 interesting? Fulfilling? I don\u2019t find gardening as enjoyable as all that, though. It\u2019s dirty work, for one thing. I\u2019ve grown a healthy distaste for dirt. That, and it\u2019s not\u2026 I mean. It is a science. But it\u2019s one that I have a hard time wrapping my head around. I work in numbers. Numbers, and words, and things that can be quantified and expressed and studied. Mathematics, logistics, politics, economics, those sorts of things. Botany\u2026 Botany is almost comparable to medicine. You can standardize your approach all you like, but in the end, it\u2019ll always come down to personal appraisal and judgment. I find it difficult to make decisions about things when I don\u2019t understand them. To draw a comparison, I understand Isra\u2019s economy, even though I don\u2019t have an intimate knowledge of each individual portion of it. But I don\u2019t understand a Narslimmus- or whatever else she has in there in the same way. I can be told about plants. When and how much to water, and such things as that. And following those sorts of instructions aren\u2019t any more difficult for me than anything else. But when it comes down to applying my judgement to something in front of me, alive, I flounder. When I can\u2019t be assured that my decision is at least the best one I could make at the time, I have trouble making any decision at all. And\u2026 for things like gardening, where the lives of the plants lie in the balance, that trait works against me. I can appreciate nature, but don\u2019t ask me to maintain it beyond the simplest and most mundane manner of gardening.\u201dBefore addressing Jun\u2019s inquiry about her family, Naoki takes a few moments of silence. It\u2019s considerative sort of silence, as she decides on and formulates her response. \u201cWell, you\u2019ve met Artemis, have you not? And you\u2019ve visited The Midnight Sun? That\u2019s the entirety of my \u2018family\u2019, past and present, as I would define it. I have no knowledge pertaining to the circumstances of my birth or ancestry. If I even have either of those things. I, as I understand myself, was brought into this world alone. As such, I\u2019ve made do with the cards I was metaphorically dealt. And that was Artemis. She and I are alike in that manner, and have adopted each other, forming a unique sort of relationship I\u2019ll not go into further.\u201dAnother, longer section of considerative silence as Naoki ponders how to proceed.\u201cAnd\u2026 as for\u2026 \u2018my people\u2019...\u201d Naoki trails off again before continuing in a decidedly factual and almost expressionless tone.\u201cAs far as I\u2019m aware, I am one of a kind. There are individuals who are similar, sure. I know a woman; Ms. Cynder. She\u2019s nice enough; named one of her children after me. She\u2019s essentially an anthropomorphic cat, with blue fur all over. Her children- which she had with Alden, they look very much like small, blue-eared versions of myself.  More adorable than should be permitted by Isra\u2019s laws, in my opinion. And while it may be tempting to simply take that at face value and assume that I was conceived in the same way, there are a number of small differences. You\u2019ll notice\u2026\u201dNaoki turns, rising in her seat  to face Jun head-on, moving a lock of hair to the side in order to display her face clearly.\u201cI have no whiskers, and no facial markings of any sort. My pupils are circular, not slit-shaped, and I cannot purr any more than you can. If I recall correctly, Alden\u2019s children do have whiskers and slit shaped eyes. And I\u2019ll be damned if my namesake didn\u2019t purr when I held her. Cheeky little bugger, she is.\u201dLeaning back down into her seat, Naoki cups her mug with both hands, drawing the warmth out into her palms as she continues, allowing a touch of emotion to make its way into her inflection at the same time.\u201cThe same can be said for other cat-like individuals. They\u2019re never quite the same. My particular set of features is just that. Paticular. I\u2019ve had myself looked at by some of the more talented medical minds of our generation. As far as anyone can tell, I am distinctly unique on the face of this world.\u201d\u201cA being all my own, sharing characteristics with some, but kinship with none.\u201dOn that somewhat somber note, Naoki stops speaking. Leaning further back into her seat, she contemplates another draw from her mug, but shelves both the idea and the mug, setting it off to one side and allowing her to gaze off into space unimpeded.

And I definitely feel like taking up gardening, maybe when the world dies down a little.\"Jun contemplated Naoki's comments on her breeding for a while. \"You know, since I left the expanse, I've made friends with a human mercenary, a bird man business owner, a deity-possessed emperor, three dragons, a kobold, a vampire, a void entity, two demons, and old woman with super-strength. I feel a bond of kinship with all of them even though I still feel loyalty to my homeland, and of course to you.

You could choose to use a towel, wrapped either around your waist or beneath your elbows, but I find that detracts too much from even heating. Instead, I prefer to place a small cloth across my face, like this one.\u201dFrom one of the shelves, Naoki selects a towel only slightly larger than her own outstretched hand. After displaying it, she places it on one end of the bench, evidently intending to utilize it. \u201cYou figure, the concentration of blood is higher in one\u2019s head, so insulating it some helps to balance that out. I\u2019m not qualified to speak at length about the powers behind it, but I find it most comfortable, and would suggest it. Try what you like, it isn\u2019t as if this will be your only opportunity to experience the sauna. And one can always things off.\u201dTo punctuate that statement, Naoki undoes the loose knot holding the front of her robe shut. (Which is apparently her only article of clothing.) While it would be breathtaking to allow it to cascade down the curves her figure and crumple to the floor, this- with only Skarlet on her side of the barrier, is neither the time nor place. And the floor is a bit wet, besides. Instead, she carefully removes the robe, folding it dutifully before placing it on one of the shelves intended for holding such things. Bending at the knees, Naoki picks up the cloth she placed onto the bench, and follows Jun into the sauna proper completely unabashedly, trusting Skarlet to proceed in at her own pace. Always skilled with prioritization, Naoki first casts a glance in Jun\u2019s direction, taking an appropriately appreciative but not quite awkward amount of time to observe her posture, figure, and\u2026 scars. Interesting. It stands to reason that Jun would have been significantly harmed, what with the sorts of adventures she fills her time with. But she also hangs out with the likes of Miss Lum, whose restorative magic- as far as Naoki is aware, is unmatched. If Jun is wearing scares, that would seem to imply that she\u2019d like to be. Perhaps she\u2019d speak about them later. If not, though, Naoki figures, she won\u2019t be too terribly disappointed. The primary reason Naoki might care to discuss it, beyond simple curiosity, would be to develop the discussion into a philosophical one starting in the realm of one\u2019s body and its role in\u2026 things. And that line of conversation could be initiated with a less potentially-touchy subject. Regardless, Naoki\u2019s gaze doesn\u2019t linger as she turns away with a slight smirk. The only scrap of cloth in her possession, is held casually in her left hand as she bends at the waist, down to address the rune panel embedded into the floor. At her touch, water springs from some hidden tap in the ceiling. Down, through the center of the room like a pillar it falls, diffusing through the grate with light splashing sounds, and down onto the rocks below. Upon making contact with the rocks, the water evaporates essentially instantaneously, suggesting that the rocks are quite hot. The steam billows back up through the grate with little to no apparent effort, being a gss and such. It continues to billow all the way up to the ceiling, filling the room with steam. With a satisfied sort of sigh, Naoki straightens, takes a moment to observe the process to ensure there are no apparent issues, and, finding none, nods to herself. With the sauna properly begun, she wastes no time in stepping off to the left side of the room and up to the uppermost ring of benches. Moving into position, Naoki decides to begin this session on her stomach. Because variety. Folding the cloth in half once, she sets it down toward one end of the bench before settling down into a lying position, folding her arms up around her head, resting the side of her face on the back of her upper hand with feet pointed down toward the opposite wall. After attaining this position, Naoki\u2019s eyes shut softly, and her breathing slows and deepens. Though she seems perfectly at ease, one ear remains trained in Jun\u2019s direction, while the other is pointed in the direction of the door, anticipating Skarlet\u2019s entry.

In a lot of ways the expanse isn't that different from any other civilization. We have something that we are proud of and would assert ourselves with against anyone. Some nations have their military, others have their religion, and we have our agriculture. And like other nations the expanse wants to protect its way of life.\"Jun pondered for a bit, staring at the glowing green rocks at the center of the sauna. \"I'd say that, at our very core, we always want to maintain who we are. We're an agricultural people who wants to maintain a stable population and live in harmony with the earth. We don't want that to change. But I also think we're drawn to the allure of novelty, of new technologies and concepts, and that we're willing to compromise in order to obtain those things. From what I understand, part of why the land-tillers were so accepting of the Belrowans was because they saw a chance to obtain enchanted weapons and farming tools, metal weapons which we don't have the infrastructure to produce en masse. We allied with Gauldin so we could learn how to use anti-magic and wards. We get luxury items and military support from Isra. Same used to be the case with the Phoenix Imperium before they fell into disarray.\"\"I think, friendships like that can be addicting, and also put us in a precarious position. We want to be friends with everyone, and share our knowledge with everyone. We also want to obtain things from everyone. And I think this creates a certain vulnerability in us... In a way, we're easy to exploit. The Phoenix Imperium made us develop a mandatory military program. Having a standing army was a novel concept that appealed to us. But because of it we felt obligated to help out in whatever wars they wanted to fight, like with Goraia and Aaedan. Deep down inside I'm sure our elders are itching to show off our full military might at the request of someone else. It's almost like we're children trying to show the older children that we can play ball as well as them. Naturally if someone we look up to asks us to be on their team, we'd say yes.\"This conversation would take place just before the battle of the undead in Aaedan, which was also the largest military operation in the Land-Tiller's history. So in a sense Jun's assessment was correct. The elders were indeed all too eager to demonstrate their military power when given the chance.\"I dunno. I feel like, we want to be who we are, but at the same time not feel inferior to anyone else. And as a people, I feel we have great potential. But sometimes I wonder if we're really ready for the world of politics. We're used to a straight forward dialogue. We don't like backdoor deals and political games. We're not used to them. And I don't want my people to become pawns in exchange for some new toys. We take for granted the fact that Isra and Gauldin and Belrow want to be trading partners and friends with us, and might even be willing to help us grow. But who knows what these nations will ask of us in return?\"Jun slowly raised her palms to her face and looked at them. She then balled them into twin fists. \"My dream is to become powerful enough to protect the expanse, just like my grandmother and Elder Havador. And so I say this as, well I guess you'd call it a patriot. We're a naive people.

Do you possess the same raw strength as your grandmother did, or the wisdom of Havador? Perhaps not; not yet. But you have two things that make your dream very much an achievable one in my eyes. For one thing, I think you\u2019re well suited to the concept, on a personal level. Look at yourself now. You\u2019re in your early twenties, and already you\u2019re among the most talented of magic users in this world. You're a prodigy; there are only a small handful of individuals, even among my own pool of warriors, who would even be able to pose a challenge to you. You\u2019ve handled matters of incredible danger and of the utmost severity before, and have come out on top in each instance. With a few scars, perhaps, but considering the sheer number of things you\u2019ve fought, it\u2019s a miracle you\u2019re not dead.\u201d\u201cThat, and there\u2019s also the other way in which individuals are powerful. The manner in which I am powerful; the social aspect. Consider your allies for just a moment. Just- half a moment, off the top of your head, consider who would be willing to lend you aid in the event of some attack against The Expanse.\u201dNaoki pauses for a breath, allowing Jun to consider the matter.\u201cThe list is substantial, to say the very least. You\u2019ve cultivated a network of powerful allies in much the same way I have. And by joining me, developing this relationship we share, our respective networks have become intertwined. If you needed help, I would do everything reasonably within my power to assist, and trust you would do the same.\u201d\u201cGive yourself a bit of credit, is what I mean to get at. You\u2019ve come a long way. You\u2019ve made friends who will protect you and help you accomplish your goals, whatever they may be. Don\u2019t be so worried. Though the Expanse is young and naive politically, all you need to do is keep doing what you\u2019re doing.\u201dWith this said, Naoki stops speaking.

Bare feet pad along polished wooden floors, adding only the softest of noises to the otherwise complete silence. In her left hand, she holds a lit candlestick, an amber glow to light the way through the otherwise dark halls- tonight is the night of the new moon. In the other hand, held at her side, is a book- and a rather large book, at that. Almost as thick as it is wide, bound with leather with two hard covers of dark wood and held shut with a leather strip. The weight of it, combined with the unwieldy shape of it has an effect on Naoki\u2019s stride, causing her to lean over to the right to compensate and take shorter steps than she would otherwise. Regardless of her impediment, however, onward through the halls she shuffles, sure in her step- this is a route she has traced many times. Shortly enough, Naoki reaches her destination: a pair of ornately carved double doors, above which a small plaque reads, \u201cLibrary.\u201d Turning her right shoulder to one of the doors, Naoki is careful not to burn herself on the candle as she leverages her weight against the door, pushing it open with a soft and decidedly feminine grunt. With a glimmer of her earring and a casual waving gesture of her tail, one of the library's numerous fireplaces roars to life, casting only enough orangish red light to illuminate the area directly before it, which would seem to be arrayed with desks and tables.Through the shadows, Naoki moves with her candle, casting long, dancing shadows as she moves among the bookcases, before approaching the the fireplace and selecting the table directly before it. Carefully setting the candle and book down upon the tabletop, Naoki doesn\u2019t sit quite yet- instead shuffling back off into the darkness. Moments later, she returns, a stack of parchment in one hand, ink and quill in the other. She sets these items down on the table along with the heavy tome before seating herself. Gently sliding the titanic tome over to sit squarely before her, Naoki examines the book closely for the second time. As established, it is- or at least seems to be, very large, very black, and bound with leather straps. Additionally, Naoki notes the silver boss- and the peculiar sort of symbol it depicts. She knows it to be mirrored on the rear based on her previous examination. It\u2019s an awfully complex symbol to simply keep the cover off the surface of the desk. It must have some manner of meaning, she muses. Probably relating to the content of the book, considering that there are no markings on the spine. Contemplating the matter further, Naoki figures that the item would really be more aptly referred to as a \u2018codex\u2019 and resolves to do so going forward.However, if what Grandma     said regarding where she found this book  codex is true- and Naoki has no reason to believe it isn\u2019t\u2026 This is would be an immense asset to her research. Unclasping the leather strap, Naoki opens the tome to a random page- letting the covers and their bosses rest on the desk. However, on the pages within, lies not the standard and widely known characters of Basic. Nor the  accented language of Gauldish, nor the light curving letters of the Elven alphabet, or any language currently spoken in The Overworld, for that matter. Instead, long and waving lines fill the pages, occasionally interspersed with dots, perpendicular lines, and other assorted symbols.Squinting at the vellum from a little ways back, Naoki remarks to herself that it almost resembles the surface of water- and the other symbols almost resemble ripples, emanating out from points across the page. Slowly, Naoki shakes her head, and amends her previous statement. This would be an immense asset to her research, after she translates it. With that goal in mind, Naoki carefully adjusts the codex on the desk, flipping back to what she understands to be the beginning. Taking her quill in hand, she begins to study the first \u2018words\u2019 of the first page and begin her postulations as to what they mean on the blank parchment she had brought. This translation would- at least for a short while, be a challenging and arduous task. Until she learns to read it, that is. Until then, however, Naoki is content to do it the hard way- using what limited knowledge of the language she has to attempt to interpret and form coherent thoughts out of the strange symbols on the page before her.

Regardless, Naoki leaves Emahra to her contemplation, continuing her idle perusal of whatever information is contained within the folder before her. Once Emahra speaks again, Naoki looks up, sliding her folder off to one side. As the plan is detailed, Naoki listens with rapt attention, occasionally interjecting with a question of her own in an attempt to both absorb the presented plan and gain a rudimentary understanding of why the plan is the way it is. Throughout the presentation, Naoki notes that while this is certainly a fairly sound-seeming plan, in matters of war such as these, being able to execute such a thing flawlessly ought to be nigh-impossible. This plan is built upon logic and assumptions- not all of which will hold true and fails to account for all sorts of variables, such as weather, for instance. However, Naoki finds herself satisfied with it. Not only is it a fair enough baseline from which to adapt from, not only is it enough to begin preparations, and not only has Naoki\u2019s understanding of grand strategy been broadened, but Emahra\u2019s presentation has proven- at least to Naoki, that she wasn\u2019t overstating her prowess, and seems to be fully capable of directing such activities- which was, in a roundabout way, Naoki\u2019s primary goal for this meeting. After Emahra has concluded her explanation, Naoki nods thoughtfully in acknowledgement before responding, \u201cYes. It would seem that way. But I\u2019m not quite as confident as you seem to be. There are too many unknowns. Our information is not recent or accurate enough. If what we\u2019ve estimated is accurate, yes, by all means, it would be a complete rout. But somehow I doubt that it would be as easy as all that.\u201dAfter thinking a moment longer, Naoki continues, \u201cI think that\u2026 if or when it ever comes down it, I would prefer to employ a more conservative strategy. But such things will remain to be seen, I suppose, and we should definitely work in cooperation with whatever allies we might have at the time to form our final strategy.\u201d All of which is quite sumptuous, Naoki supposes.

It is equally- if not more secure, and offers the same convenience of travel as the other locations, but offers a few unique services- I doubt that Valerian's Villa has as well-trained kitchen staff, for one thing. Even if you don\u2019t intend on spending every night up here, I think it would be a good idea to claim one of these rooms as your own.\u201dGesturing, Naoki and Emahra seem to have arrived at one of the Chalet\u2019s bedroom wings.

Emarha would find the same system of doorknob locks utilised at The Sun Marshal Headquarters to be in use here, and each room to be highly varied in its decoration; she might need to do a bit of looking to find one that suits her taste.With her invitation stated, Naoki stands off to one side idly, waiting to see how Emahra might react.

The room is almost perfectly cubical, measuring about twenty meters to a side. The walls, ceiling, and floor are all of plain and largely unremarkable stone bricks, of about average size. The room has exactly one door, centered on one of the walls and seemingly made of some sort of metal- though a handful of runes are carved into its surface. It is within this room that Naoki has begun her preparations. On the right side of the room if one is standing in the doorway, a table has been brought in. A long, squat sort of table, with six sturdy legs. Atop it, a fair variety of items have been placed. Among them are assorted candles, quills, parchment, and ink, bits of chalk, bottles filled with a variety liquids- some of them glowing, a set of matches, and a few suspiciously large, phallic shaped items. Among these items, one in particular stands out, and it is a large book, a tome, even, bound in purple letter and quite thick. It sits in the center of the table, open to a page, though numerous bookmarks hang their tassels out of the top. In the center of the chamber, there is a raised dais, of the circular variety. Or perhaps it is an altar. Whatever the case may be, it seems to be made of a sort of bluish gray, and very smooth stone. The top of the platform is smooth, polished, and perhaps five meters in diameter, but the sides bear all manner of intricate runes, etchings, and depictions. Though the purpose of the runes would remain unclear to all but the finest of rune mages, the drawings and depictions interspersed throughout feature a suspicious number of lewd shapes, engaged in all sorts of activities, as well as a fair number of dark, demonic sorts of symbols. It\u2019s a bit of a strange thing to behold- almost surreal in how the content of what would otherwise be a very fine and cultured bit of art is so exceptionally lewd, and the very sheer dichotomy in texture between the top and the sides. The floor immediately around the altar is clean clear of obstructions for the time being. It is only around the very edges of the enclosure that candles seem to have been lit. Though the candles vary considerably in size, shape, and color, none of them are particularly interesting or provide anything more beyond flickering light. Additionally, it should be noted at this point that while none of the items within the room have any active magics about them at the moment, the powerful pervasive magics and wards placed upon The Chalet have been modified somewhat for this particular chamber. Notably, the wards that prevent any and all manners of magical entry to the grounds have been modified to allow only those who have been invited, just the same as the teleportation rooms. Additionally, certain other magics that would usually be all but prohibited are, in this particular chamber, permitted. Furthermore, there are a fair number of miscellaneous protective sorts of spells in place here that are not seen elsewhere, though none are active at the moment. However, the heating spell that keeps the entire complex at a toasty 76\u2109 continues to function in the chamber without Beyond those items which have already been detailed, there exists only one more item of note in the chamber, and it is Madame Naoki. Standing there completely unadorned and unclothed, with the table behind her, the altar a few feet before her, and the door off to her left, she surveys the preparations. Everything\u2026 seems to be in order. Because as it so happens, the book on the table is entitled Wes\u2019 Grand Compendium of Summoning, and was authored by legendary wizard, Wes the Wizard. And as the book says, there are all manner of parallel, alternate, and wildly alien planes of existence, and all it takes is an incredible amount of very intricate and dangerous magic to forcibly yank the denizens of one of those planes over to this plane to do one\u2019s bidding. If one follows The Wes School of Summoning\u2019s Ways, there are three major components to a summoning spell. The first is the bit that does the pulling, the abduction. It is further categorized into the bit that does the pulling, and the bit that plops whatever the creature is wherever it is that you want it, but that\u2019s irrelevant. The second portion is the bit that binds the creature to do the will of the summoner. Because oftentimes, the creatures are less than pleased to have been yanked across time and space, and would much sooner bite the summoner\u2019s head off than go perform whatever embarrassing tasks the summoner would have them. As such, some magic can be applied so that the creature has no choice in the matter. The third portion is optional, and that is the bit that one could use to apply other magics to their creature. Enchantments to make them more durable, stronger, or not prone to smelling quite so awful. However, Naoki does not follow The Wes School of Summoning\u2019s ways. Not in this instance, at least. Here, she has chosen to, rather than using a scepter of some variety to create the runes out of magic itself, to carve them into this dias. This has limited her to a very narrow window of summoning magic, and furthermore, she has only chosen to utilize the first portion of the spell, the one that does the pulling and the plopping- and at that, she hasn\u2019t even done the right sort of runes to make it an infallible spell. Where Wes the Wizard might utilize a great metaphorical hand of magic to reach across time and space to pluck whoever he might see fit from their home, Naoki instead uses a single beckoning finger and the magical equivalent of a wink and a smirk. Indeed, Naoki has bastardized Wes\u2019 noble summoning magics to make a device which essentially invites beings into this chamber. Only beings of a demonic and lusty persuasion, at that. However, with that in mind, Naoki has her sights set at the very top. This altar, with its particular configuration of carefully selected runes, is intended to summon the most powerful and lustiest demon that currently exists- whoever that may be.

Right to the chase, this one. Which is probably fitting, she supposes- she's the same way herself, most of the time.

Naoki was very smart indeed, to want clarification. So, she decided to elaborate.\"When a soul is promised to a normal demon, it becomes little more than the property of that demon, or else it gets lost in the morass of wandering souls in whichever Circle that demon belongs to. When a soul is promised to a Demonlord - or Demonlady, as the case may be - the results change. Being naturally more powerful, we can do as we like with the soul, whether that be binding it to servitude, using it to power magics, et cetera.

Though the offer is very clearly a generous one, there is much to be considered. Truthfully, Naoki hasn\u2019t done very much thinking about the \u2018afterlife\u2019, more concerned with what would happen in her absence than what she would do once she\u2019s gone. Contingency plans, successors, wills, and such. But as for what to do with her soul\u2026 Well, the question sort of begs itself, she supposes. Because while Naoki is very firmly opposed to \u2018mortal\u2019 immortality of the sort that vampires have, the soul is sort of immortal by default, she supposes. Which makes things a bit troublesome- in that her options are limited. The first option is to accept Lust\u2019s offer, and do as she suggests. Which is a very attractive concept, Naoki thinks. There\u2019s something to be said not only for the experience of it- spending eternity in neverending throes of pleasure with those who do it best but also for the security of it. Knowing her own soul to be a fairly valuable one- and being all but certain that it has dramatically increased in value since it was last appraised, the possibility of some manner of gluttony demon or another soul-eating or collecting creature eating her soul is quite high- if she doesn\u2019t take steps to protect it. Hence the attractiveness of Lust\u2019s offer. Once promised, Naoki would presumably need to take no further action after death to ensure the safety of her soul, Lust here would simply come and take it. But then again, so could anyone else. So could Grandma, or so could Ms. Lum, for that matter. And considering the resources at her disposal, it would be fairly trivial for Naoki to have her soul forcibly reincarnated into a new body of her choosing. But then that\u2019s immortality, isn\u2019t it. Is it really without the mind, though? It\u2019s hard to say- that\u2019s a question about the relationship of the mind and the soul, and those are always tricky. But beyond that, what of everyone else? Though Naoki supposes she won\u2019t really have any problems in accounting for Artemis and Skarlet\u2019s afterlives- as there likely won\u2019t be any, what of Kate\u2019s? Or Liz\u2019, Jun\u2019s, or Emahra\u2019s, for that matter? Thinking to herself quite frankly, Naoki muses that if she\u2019s going to spend eternity with anyone, she would really prefer to spend it with someone she loves rather than Tentacles over here. But accepting the offer would put her in a pretty reasonable position to negotiate for that- for their souls as well, she supposes. And really, Naoki doesn't think that Kate would much object to that sort of afterlife. However, if Naoki doesn\u2019t accept the offer, she could probably also go about achieving the same thing in another way. There\u2019s nothing in particular besides convention that says that one\u2019s soul needs to either go up and down, and those forces can be circumvented by people like Grandma anyway\u2026 These sorts of spiraling questions, doubts, and wildly out of control trains of thought are the sort that plague Naoki as she takes a few steps over to the altar and seats herself upon it, finding her legs just barely long enough such so that her feet brush against the floor, but cannot rest properly on it. At least it\u2019s warm, she supposes. For the space of a few moments, she simply sits in deep concentration, staring into one of the candles, watching it flicker and waver slightly as candles tend to even in the absence of a breeze. Presently, however, she begins her response, slowly and ponderously, choosing each word carefully. \u201cWell. Allow me first to state that I am flattered by your offer. I believe that I have a handle on the\u2026\u201d With one hand, Naoki gesticulates idly as she searches for the word. \u201cThe significance- the gravity of what you\u2019re offering me, and honestly, it\u2019s a bit strange to receive such an offer from someone I\u2019ve only met in the past\u2026 what, ten, fifteen minutes? And who hasn\u2019t quite introduced themselves beyond their title. Not that I mean to imply anything about your manners, or my opinion of you so far- it\u2019s just that I\u2019m surprised that I\u2019ve made such an impression that you would offer something like that to me.\u201d This, Naoki offers in a light yet polite sort of tone, not intending to come off as rude or upset. \u201cFurthermore,\u201d she continues, \u201cI\u2019m beginning to have second thoughts about dying in the traditional sense at all- I might, later in life, decide to simply not, and continue to accrue power in my own right. The semantics on that might get a bit strange if I utilize some means of resurrection, so allow me to make this counter proposal.\u201dSliding down off the altar, Naoki turns to face her guest directly\u00a0and puts her business voice back on to continue,\u00a0\u201cI will accept that third proposed term with the following condition. If I might like to stay up here in the overworld for a while longer than may be considered \u2018fair\u2019, by whatever means I may choose to employ, you will allow me to, and will not attempt by any means to secure my soul before I am prepared to surrender it. However, as I suspect will be the case, I die- regularly, in the traditional sense, and opt to stay dead, my soul will be yours to do as you propose.

Thinking a bit further, Naoki supposes that it must be an unintended side effect, considering that it\u2019s hardly something one would want- to give others power over them. But then at that point, what constitutes a \u2018true\u2019 name? Aren\u2019t all names given or assumed, by their nature? Or do demons have some specific naming convention, courtesy of some higher power? That would be somewhat fiddly with mortals becoming demons, though. Well, at least \u2018Naoki\u2019 is an explicitly assumed name, which is somewhat convenient, she supposes. But in any case, as nice as it is to know Charyss\u2019 name, and to have that degree of leverage, it still doesn\u2019t quite solve the issue, Naoki muses. She still can\u2019t use that name to refer to Charyss for conversational purposes, which was why she asked for the name in the first place.\u2018But that can be readdressed later\u2019, says the growing sense of need between Naoki\u2019s legs. \u2018There are altogether too many words coming out, and not enough tentacles going in!\u2019, it says. Unfortunately, the gap between Naoki\u2019s legs is not very well versed in economics and is prone to creating trade gaps.

Those, as well as numerous vaults, workshops, and other rooms that wouldn\u2019t be suitable to have anywhere above. However, once up the steps and through the thick door leading downward, things brighten up considerably. They seem to have emerged into a large hallway, wide enough for perhaps five persons to walk side by side comfortably. The floor is done in polished wood and mostly covered by a crimson carpet running down the center of the hall. Warm lighting is provided by chandeliers, which shines downward onto the occasional painting, potted plant, and bits of bric-\u00e0-brac placed on tables. Taking a right, Naoki walks swiftly along the edge of the hallway, such so that as she drips, she doesn\u2019t drip onto the carpet, but rather the wood. Luckily enough, it isn\u2019t very far, and Naoki doesn\u2019t encounter anyone along the way. Not that anyone could reasonably question or chastise her- and there aren\u2019t any children about, but it would still be somewhat awkward to explain why she\u2019s running about naked, covered in bodily fluids, with a tentacle demon on her shoulder.As it turns out, the nearest bath is one of the larger ones. That is to say, it\u2019s a massive and luxurious marble affair, centered around a central, circular basin embedded into the floor that could probably seat twenty comfortably. In addition to the restroom off to one side, the room also features a few cabinets, some pegs- presumably for hanging clothing on, and a secondary basin, off to the left of the first and roughly a quarter of the size. It is this secondary tub that Naoki approaches, and carefully crouches beside. Next to the edge, a few palm-sized black stones are placed in stark contrast to the pale white marble. Upon each stone, symbols have been carved. After taking a moment to study the symbols, Naoki places her palm on one of them, and waits for a moment. A few moments later, the very same glyph appears on the bottom of the tub, and begins to glow. A second later, Naoki and Forni are buffeted by a sudden wave of heat, seemingly emanating from what must be some manner of heating rune. Stating the obvious, Naoki narrates to Forni, \u201cOops- that\u2019s the heat.\u201dMoving her hand to another one of the black stones, Naoki glances up to the tub. This time, water begins to flow in from two points high on the walls where before, no spout was visible. Nodding slightly to herself, Naoki seems satisfied. Based on how quickly it seems to be filling, it will take the tub a few minutes before it\u2019s suitable to enter. With this in mind, Naoki seats herself on the edge- careful not to press any of the stones with her behind, with her legs dangling down into the basin. Without much more to do until the tub fills, she turns her attention to Forni. \u201cFornilan, hm?...\u201d She trails off, eyeing him. \u201cI suppose you feed on lust?

Lifting and separating her legs as appropriate, standing, and eventually rolling over to rest her crossed arms on the edge of the tub as he presumably gets far enough to need to access her back. Throughout the course of it, he wouldn\u2019t note any unusual areas of ticklishness. The bottoms of the feet, the stomach and lower chest, and the armpits- nothing out of the ordinary in that sense, it would seem to be only her reaction that is exaggerated.

The top of her head is bone-dry, as is the portions of her hair not long enough to be in the water. For another moment, she seems to consider. To do the hair properly, or to not. After an amount of consideration, she concludes that she\u2019s far too lazy to do that now. With this in mind, she steps up out of the tub, apparently finished. On her way past, she takes a moment to step on one of the runestones in the floor, causing the water level in the basin to begin to slowly drop as it is drained away by some unknown mechanism of magic. Stepping carefully across the floor toward the cabinets, Naoki raises her voice slightly such so that Forni would be able to hear clearly as she begins, \u201cWell. \u2026 Her name is Kate. Kate Green. She\u2019s a bit shorter than I am, but not by too much.\u201d Having reached the cabinets, she begins to putter about in search of a towel.

Her hair is a sort of pinkish white or silver color, not unlike the color of a lotus\u2026.\u201d Silently, Naoki supposes that Forni may not quite know what a lotus is, so that may not have been the best comparison to make, but she continues regardless, \u201c...and falls down around her shoulders in big wavy curls. In an interesting coincidence, her eyes are almost just like mine, very nearly the same color\u2026 prettier, though.\u201dHaving located a suitable towel, Naoki seats herself on a bench presumably placed for just such a purpose and begins to dry herself. \u201cBeyond that, she always seems to be smiling. Always cheerful, perpetually optimistic. It\u2019s infectious, too, whenever she\u2019s around, I can\u2019t help but feel happy myself. \u2026 Though, that may just be because I love her.\u201d With a small shrug, Naoki proceeds about the process of drying herself, and once finished would return to the cabinets, seeking something to wear.

To this day, I have yet to meet as well mannered an individual. He was always very polite, very courteous- at least to me, and never got particularly angry in public. For one so intrinsically related to anger, I still don\u2019t know how he managed to control himself as well as he did.\u201dAs she\u2019s speaking, Naoki takes a half-step over to the counter Forni is sitting on, and extends her arm to place her hand, palm up, on the surface. With a beckoning motion of her fingers, Naoki suggests that Forni slide his way over onto her hand. From there, he would be free and able to scoot up her arm to the shoulder, or wherever else he might please to scoot to. If he opts simply to sit on her hand, she would bend her elbow to hold him at her side.\u201cBut I digress. Mr. Maelik cooked for Kate and me on numerous occasions and had a habit of sticking around to watch people take the first bite- that was his favorite part. And though it was a bit awkward the first time they met, Kate didn\u2019t have much of an issue with him after a few meals, so I doubt she would have much of an issue with you.\u201dWith that final word, Naoki would- if it is convenient to do so, give Forni a lightly teasing nudge, or some equivalent thereof.

Alright.\u201d Naoki finds Forni\u2019s response somewhat surprising. She had expected some manner of retort, or at least a more begrudging acceptance. As she understands, beings like Forni make their existence off forcing themselves on lone female adventurers as they explore dark and musty caves and such. But then, perhaps it\u2019s like bears, in that though they may have a reputation for eating people, in reality, they only attack when threatened or exceptionally hungry. At some point, she resolves to have Forni clearly explain these sorts of things, but until then, she doesn\u2019t think it will be too difficult to keep his appetite stated herself. However, further discussion is precluded as they arrive at Naoki\u2019s destination. Down at the end of a somewhat lengthy corridor of bedrooms, a single, wide door sits alone on the far wall. As Naoki approaches, her earring glimmers slightly, and the door opens outward of its own accord. However, before it does, Forni may be able to read the plaque on the door: Artemis, Kate & NaokiAs Naoki proceeds inward, Forni would find himself in a large room\u2026Feb 26, 2016 20:05:18 GMT -8 Artemis said:The door opens\u00a0 into a large room with a high vaulted ceiling. A freestanding fireplace and multiple couches, chairs, and tables furnish the room; thick fur rugs line the floor in strategic places. The hues of the oak and cedar boards paneling the room are darker than in the rest of the chalet, but lighter by several shades than the mahogany and dark oak scheme of the Midnight Sun. The walls are tastefully adorned with paintings. In one corner of the room sits an unusual furnishing - a tree. A quarter of the top portion of a mighty oak, where the branches start, has been felled, trimmed, treated, and placed in the corner. Thick limbs, stripped of bark and cured, run into the room, rising and spreading to meet the angles of the ceiling, where they are continued in a masterful mural depicting a view of the night sky from under a bare-limbed tree. Several forks and some of the more horizontal branches look like they would be particularly well suited to sitting on. Small magical lamps hang on strings draped among the branches, glowing and twinkling like little stars.There are five doors in the walls of this central room - three on the left wall, as viewed from the door, one on the right, and one on the far wall. The door in the right wall leads to the study. A line of windows along the far wall overlooks the lake and lets natural light into the room. Under the windows and continuing around the left wall of the room runs a single desk, books littered sporadically on its surface. The proper home of those books is with many of their fellows on the set of bookshelves running part of the right wall, next to a set of organizer shelves and boxes. A circular stand-alone fireplace occupies the middle of the room, along with several exceptionally comfortable-looking armchairs, two circular tables, and dark red upholstered chairs to go with them. Luxurious carpet covers the floor. The whole atmosphere is cozy and inviting, the perfect place to curl up with a book and watch the snow fall outside.The door in the far end of the common room leads to the bedroom, which is dominated by a large four-poster bed, hung with red velvet curtains, that could easily fit four people. In the middle of the back wall, a large bay window, the shelf of which is large enough to sit in comfortably, provides a stunning panoramic view of the mountains, forest, and lake. The window is flanked on either side by a small fireplace flattening the corner of the room. The rich carpet from the study is duplicated in the bedroom. Paintings of various sizes adorn the walls, with the exception of one conspicuously bare spot. A small bookshelf, a table and two chairs, a wardrobe, and a dresser complete the room\u2019s furnishings. A door in the right wall of the bedroom leads to the bathroom. Done primarily in blue slate with dark paneled walls, the main feature of the bathroom is a tub that\u2019s very nearly large enough to swim in.There is a door in the right wall of the bedroom which is currently locked, although no keyhole is visible.Disregarding the doors on the left and right, Naoki proceeds directly through the central room through to the bedroom. With one hand, she gestures to the dominant bit of furniture, and speaks, \u201cThis is the sleeping bed- we don\u2019t stain it.\u201d Without stopping, she proceeds around the bed to the left, to the door situated on that wall. At a touch of her hand, it unlocks and opens inward, revealing a peculiar sort of room just beyond. The room is square and somewhat sizeable, but not overly so. The floor is of polished wooden boards and the walls are the same, though a different sort of wood. A single enormous mirror fills the right wall. Tables with restraints, stocks, and other devices stand around the floor. A bed stands against one wall, though it isn\u2019t quite as large or luxurious as its fellow in the room behind them. Two hooks are embedded in the ceiling. A table and several shelves hold a variety of whips, manacles, and other\u2026 instruments. \u201cThis,\u201d Naoki continues as she strides over to it, \u201cIs the fun bed.\u201dQuirking an eyebrow at the creature on her shoulder, Naoki smirks as she asks, \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d", "link_list": ["/post/25728/thread", "/user/608"], "image_list": ["//storage.proboards.com/6046952/avatar/asRz0hoCrKdCGuElJ606.png"], "html": "\u201cHmmh.

Naoki\u2019s discomfort of the snow and cold hadn\u2019t been missed by Haru. Although he wasn\u2019t particularly good at understanding hooman\u2019s in a normal way, his instincts let him pick up certain things that he would otherwise miss.

He paced back and forth before suddenly halting, his muscles tensing up. Without any other warning, Haru leaped forwards through the air, reaching the height of perhaps twenty feet. However, instead of dropping back to the ground, Haru only kept gaining in altitude and speed. Naoki would feel the rush of cold air pushing against her as the pair of them rocketed upwards at a rather steep angle. Right around the time Naoki might be thinking she had made a terrible decision by agreeing to ride Haru, the cold wind that had been battering away at her vanished.

It was as if some unseen force was helping hold her in place on Haru\u2019s back.Inspection of her surroundings would reveal the disappearance of the cold wind was not due to Haru halting his flight, in fact, they still seemed to be accelerating upwards at breakneck speeds. A faintly translucent orb seemed to have surrounded Haru, only visible at certain angles, but Naoki would be able to make it out.

With a wave of her hand, Naoki presents the library to Reese, as seeking his approval.Grown from the burgeoning collection of books behind her desk in The Midnight Sun, it seems as if she's has collected some thousands of books to stock the library. The library may be remarkable in the sense of how airy may feel. Many libraries make use of high towering bookcases - all very close together to fit as many books as possible. In contrast, the Chalet's shelves are short, appropriate for bending and perhaps sitting upon.Which is to say, The Lady cannot be bothered to use a stool or goodness forbid, a ladder. Either that or perhaps it was built with smaller people in mind.What is not underdone is the fireplace. In the center of the room, it stands freely, a focal point for the rest of the library. It has big, tall-backed chairs placed all around it, fit for intense lounging, contemplation, or perhaps storytelling, complete with footrests. Small tables and other chairs are scattered about, with a ring of carpets around the center. The Chalet was, after all, engineered with maximum coziness in mind. Within the course of a few moments Naoki is seated, her overcoat slung over the back of the chair.

From the aspect of the historian, indeed, I would think. I\u2019ve done an awful lot in these few years, and how I did it is - if I might say so, somewhat exceptional. But I digress- I\u2019ll then go back and give detail after I establish this core for my story.\u201dWith that having been said, Naoki pauses to collect her thoughts. Reaching into her pouch, Naoki pulls out a small handful of gemstones, each about the size of her thumb nail. She sets all but one on the arm of the chair and begins to idly play with the other one, as is her habit.In such a manner, she begins. \u201cI\u2019ll start at that point, years ago, when I had first decided to go secure for myself a seat on The Assembly when I began to gather \u2018power\u2019 for the first time.\u201dWith \u201cpower,\u201d Naoki motions quotation marks in the air with her fingers, stressing the word.\u201cAnd that was a trivial matter, as it turned out. A few months following, I set my sights on a higher position, following Grandma\u2019s appointment as \u2018Minister for the Defense\u2019 or whatever it was. You ought to remember as much as this\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd I went, and the visit to The Citadel for that- to get that position was interesting enough - though it lacks details significant to the narrative I\u2019m laying out. Let it suffice to say that I walked out of The Citadel that day as Isra\u2019s treasurer.\u201d\u201cThat,\u201d she says, brandishing one finger, \u201cWas really what started me off, that position. It was more than just a foothold; I used that influence in everything, moving forward; and I still do. It\u2019s where histories of me will start, I think. The Sun\u2026 The Sun will be a tertiary detail, even though it seems so significant as the metaphorical foundation of my life today.\u201dShe pauses again, staring blankly off into the fire. There's much to think about there, about The Midnight Sun, and path she's struck from there to here. After a moment she continues, \u201cBut it was the purse strings, Reese, is what I had. They have more sway over things than the driving reins, and I saw as much firsthand. ... You\u2019ll recall, \u2018He who holds the purse strings, rules the house, the nation, the world.\u2019\u201d She says this in a faithful imitation of Reese's voice, as it was he that spoke those words in the context of a discussion on history.A pause. \u201cThat\u2019s truer than anything. All of the things I\u2019ve taken away from my studies - that fact is perhaps the truest- if there is such a thing. \u2026 My favor became the most important sort of favor. From my appointment as Treasurer to election as Lady, it was a more or less linear progression. It was just a matter of growing influence - and that's been the easiest part. It\u2019s been my legwork, so to speak\u2026\u201dTrailing off, Naoki continues over the course of the next few hours to relate her story to Reese. She never does get around to going back to fill in detail as she alluded to because the direction of her \u201cstrokes\u201d is nowhere near clear enough to be filled in around. She rambles and rambles, making progress very slowly, digressing into all manner of potentially interesting secondary topics along the way. Whether or not Reese finds the topics interesting, Naoki doesn\u2019t seem to be putting much thought into. She\u2019s careful to mention everything significant- everything he needs to have a full enough understanding but shines her own little lights on many details Reese wouldn\u2019t ever inquire about.Somewhere along the way, a well dressed young lady comes in with a mug of hot chocolate. Naoki takes it, smiling and thanking the woman, and the woman gives Reese a respectful nod to the effect of, \u201cYou can\u2019t drink and we both know it, but if you did, I would have brought you something - the intention is there.\u201d An intention she hopes he would understand, one that she presumes he's seen before.After a time, Naoki reaches a natural stopping point- just after telling him about her most recent move: declaring Isra an Empire and herself an Empress. \u201cAnd so ends what I feel you\u2019ve missed.

No, it couldn't be. That took place too far away. The crown of Old Queen Thermyla, perhaps? No, the accurate depictions all had much smaller gems.

Perhaps he could bug a few of his scholarly acquaintances that made a habit of studying such things; that could certainly prove profitable.Ah, bother. It was his turn.

The muffled sound of winds rushing and a crackling fireplace fills the silence. In fact, windows line the opposite wall, offering an immediate mountain vista. Off to the left, one end of the lake is visible through flurries of snow, frozen. The room is evidently on the second story or higher, as the tops of pine trees are just outside.  The mountain and the forest slope abruptly down toward a lower valley, while the shapes of other mountains fade in and out of view in the background.Contrasting beautifully is the room in which they stand.

Here, there are paintings on the wall, sconces on both sides, and definite, visible ends to the hall, in the form of turns at either end. Other, similar doors are present up and down, bearing small plaques with words or symbols on them. Symbols such as stairs, a book, fire, a bed marked #5, and their destination: a bathtub.

Soap, towels, and other bathing essentials are available on shelves and hooks which Naoki thinks ought to be accessible by the children with some tip-toes.

She stands back to hold the door.Here within The Chalet, Naoki has prepared something similar to a small house. ('Small,' being a relative term.) These double doors are skin to front doors, and the only ones leading in. Immediately through them, there is the sitting room, featuring a fireplace in one corner, an assortment of large chairs, a few bookcases, six little desks, and other typical furniture. It serves as the connecting room to three others, one on each face. To the left is the dining room, with appropriately sized tables and chairs, bunches upon bunches of snacks, and not a single knife. Off to the right of the entrance is the playroom, which contains an awful lot of books for something called a \u2018playroom,\u2019 as well a questionably excessive number of \u201ccommon\u201d children\u2019s toys. Common in that they are mundane such as rocking horses, blocks, plush animals, and so on, but far from common in quality; Naoki sprang for the good stuff. Commissioned a master toymaker, in fact. Many of the toys are signed. A few easels sit in one corner.Finally, directly across from the entrance is the bedroom, a carefully planned affair. Upon entering, one would see three little beds lined up on both the left and right sides. Each one has with it a small dresser, an empty box, a bedside table, a stool, and a short wall to separate it from its neighbor. Down at the far end of the room, the two chests the children packed are sitting on the floor, open, amidst larger dressers. Two doors at the end are labeled \u201cNaoki,\u201d and \u201cMs. Higgs,\u201d and these lead off to regular sized and fully featured bedrooms.Save for those bedrooms; each room is connected by doorways filled with hanging strings of wooden beads. Though unconventional and perhaps a bit out of place, these beads serve a vital purpose - they\u2019re noisy. Every time anyone passes through a doorway, the beads are set in motion, clacking against each other to announce movement. Naoki hopes that the noise won\u2019t become too grating as the days wear on.Once everyone is in, the doors click shut behind them, locking.

It\u2019s a bit early in her day for existential questions, she thinks, but after a few moments of thought, she gives it her best shot.\u201cOne of the most interesting things, I think is how magic chooses to apply in any given situation. Apply, or alternatively manifest, in situations where multiple sorts of magic could, potentially. An easy example is the afterlife. What happens when you die? One of the big questions. It depends. One option is the Demonic Realm with whose lords I\u2019ve socialized with -- The Hellscape. I imagine I will probably end up there, in the very end, but not everyone will. Some people simply die, leaving behind absolutely nothing but a corpse. Some return as ghosts or specters -- sometimes of their own volition, sometimes not.\u201dNaoki shrugs with one arm as she takes a sip of her drink. \u201cThere\u2019s also those whose souls are captured and put in jars before they have a chance to go anywhere else. Some souls are eaten. Some people don\u2019t even have a soul in the same sense as some others, and something entirely different happens when they die. Some of us...\u201d She gestures at Skarlet with her mug.\u201c...Are effectively immortal. Does the concept of afterlife still apply, and if so, does it apply in the same way to you as it might to me? \u2026 Hard to say. Impossible, even, until the moment it happens, I feel. It presumably depends on your actions and the choices you make in life, but the entire field of study on this topic is essentially banging its head against the wall, and has been for a while.\u201d\u201cAs I've read, observations and arduous testing confirm some things, such as that often, in the context of the afterlife, what one thinks will happen, happens. Remote tribes that don\u2019t speak Common have never heard of the Hellscape, and as a result, few of them will end up there. They seem to go to the 'promised land' of their religion. seemingly because that's where they think they'll go.\u201dAll warmed up, Naoki pauses to take another sip of her drink.\u201cAnother experiment aims to conclusively claim that their magic, with their totem poles and their soothsayers, is just as valid as any other, and functions just as well. In one study, someone like that -- a remote-tribal sort, a powerful magical one, was brought to what passed for civilization at the time, learned the language (a dialect of elvish), and attempted to learn their magics.\u201d\u201cHe couldn\u2019t. And they tried all manner of things in due course of experimentation, but to the end, despite all efforts, he never could do elven magics. If you start thinking that things like beliefs and heritage playing into things, the topic gets very complicated and nigh-unsolvable very quickly.\u201d\u201cSo,\u201d Naoki says, reeling it back in, \u201cI feel I can\u2019t give you a good answer to that question, and I don\u2019t think anyone can provide a definitive answer.\u201d\u201cBut. Considering, I think it likely that C\u00e9line believed in ghosts. They\u2019re so ingrained in general understandings and notable literature that I think it entirely plausible that anyone could believe that ghosts exist, even those in realms where they don\u2019t. So, perhaps, since you think you will, in the very end, end up with more ghosts than just C\u00e9line .\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s hard to say. ...

Let's say there is a married couple, a man and a woman for this example though it doesn't really matter. They live in a slum and are opposites of each other, the man is a crook and the woman is like a saint.She is noble, proud, as well as pure, righteous and beautiful, and actually even goddess-like. But at the same time, she is a hopelessly foolish woman. While her family are so impoverished they would be worried about eating meals that day----While both she and her child, were in an environment where they suffered from having empty stomachs, she shared the paltry sum of money she had worked to earn with hungry children in the neighbourhood and other 'weaklings' like it was her duty to help them at her family's own expense. She would scatter kindness to all around her while putting herself and her family second. This is certainly Noble and Proud, but in the bottom rung of society, there is nobody to assess that nobility and pride. In an idyllic country town such character would be reasonably recognized, but in a town worse than a ditch she would be a laughingstock. The children and elderly who take her charity would roar with laughter like they were seeing a thoroughly entertaining hilarious joke being played.\"\"In that town, the way the father lived is viewed as correct and honest though he steals and swindles. The son sees how uninhibited and cunningly the father lived and thinks it cool.While the father certainly isn't looked up to, he is respected. And in response to necessity, or even not in response to necessity, he would beat other people including his wife and child. However, at the end of his life, he does something uncharacteristic. Laying on his death bed, he gives something to his son could use to escape the squalor they lived in, a ticket to become successful, an opportunity to become better. After granting this gift to his child he dies at peace knowing that his son was smart enough to use this gift. In the end he found his own form of heaven, but the woman who spent her life being generous and kind may not have found heaven because of the suffering she went through, even though she was a good person.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"You really think you will go there when you die?

She was kind of a complex person, hard to predict. She was a real veteran, all kinds of battles. And she was strong, stronger than anyone I've ever met.\"Jun raised her hand and summoned a light construct. It was a crystal statue of a woman in robes, of similar build to Jun. The woman had a foot forward and a very determined postured. \"We have the same hairstyle.\" She grinned, pointing at her shoulder-length, rounded hair. \"Sorry, I'm not crazy. I mean, I'm a little crazy but-\" She shook her head. \"This is what the statue of her looks like, the one in the Elder's Council. All the Chaos Mages are there. She's the most realistic looking one though, because chaos mages only appear every few centuries. So the tales of the others become greatly exaggerated. Like, one of the older ones has flaming wings and crap.\"She closed her fist and shut off the construct. \"I went to school in the Guardian Tower, a big spire near the council. That's where people with magic potential go to learn things. My grandmother wasn't my main teacher, but she was my tutor. And I was obsessed with magic and with getting stronger and stronger. I felt a strong sense of obligation to keep up with her, even though I knew it was impossible. Chaos mages are kind of like chosen ones. You just don't get to be one. Oh but I was obsessed. It was why I left the tribe. I had to be the strongest. I had to be the best... But, that was a mistake. My obsession with surpassing her did a lot of psychological harm to me. It actually almost made me evil. If it hadn't been for Lum'Valia, I might have gone down a very dark path. So it's lucky I met her.\"She sighed. \"I think it was the void she left when she died. She died suddenly. I was about 12 I think. They say it was natural causes but I never believed it. Later I found out her husband resurrected her and used her as a kind of super weapon. I think he was jealous and power hungry. But somehow she broke out of it. Anyways, while I was training with Lum'Valia, I got a glimpse of the afterlife. Long story. But I met her. And she, I dunno, she convinced me to let it go, to follow my own path. I think her abrupt death made me feel like the only way I could be close to her was to keep getting stronger. I'm glad to be rid of that burden though. I feel much better about my life.\"That's why I didn't bother looking for her at the festival. I always believed that souls reincarnated when they died. I just didn't think she'd be there anymore. But, I don't think I know much about the afterlife at all. Maybe I was wrong. Hopefully, she doesn't hold it against me.

They're called chaos mages because they're instigators of change. Usually, they change regimes, the status quo, whatever needs changing. What they do, they usually do for the greater good. Where they come from? Well, funny thing is, this was a mystery up until about a year ago, when the elves and Va'nei appeared.\"It all started thousands of years, you know, the way most of these stories do. Our people were primitives who were fleeing from an ancient race of sapient reptilians, the kiraxians I think they were called. We arrived in the Expanse and hid there. Turns out the place was already occupied by elves. Our ancestors were simple folk who were sensitive to changes in the climate. We knew how to live in harmony with the land. We had a knack for it I guess. Turns out we had a lot in common with the elves, so they let us stay. And they drove off the kiraxians with powerful magic. Fast forward a few centuries and Va'nei shows up. She was so impressed with our efforts that she blessed the land with a powerful magical presence. It's like a contract we have with the land. As long as we live in harmony with it, it'll bless us. This magical force is apparently what chooses the chaos mages. Chaos mages have the ability to manipulate every element. Their signature ability is the power to cast light and dark magic simultaneously. No one else in my tribe can do that. They're supposed to be chosen for their spiritual potential, their capacity to understand what nature connects us with the elements, and master those natures within themselves. Basically, they're supposed to be complete, enlightened people I guess.\"...After her long-winded explanation, Jun was famished.\"Oooh! This looks good!\" After a precautionary sniff, Jun immediately began to devour the slithery sustenance. Its odd appearance didn't offend her at all, not when she had eaten fried bee larva before. \"Mmmm! Oh, you say they're intelligent?\" Jun looked at the deceased and tasty master of camouflage with some sadness. \"...

The walls, ceiling, and floor are of nondescript stone bricks of average size. There is exactly one door, a huge swinging affair, made of metal and covered in runes. Naoki now returns to this room for the first time in some years, with a basket in one hand and a book under her arm. Things seem to be largely as she left them, with the dais in the center, the table on the right, and candles around the edges\u2014all still lit. It\u2019s a purpose-built room, and reflecting on it, she applauds the design. It\u2019s the candles and that dim, flickering light that really give it the \"ritualistic charm,\" as it were.After ensuring the door is properly shut, she deposits her basket on the table and unceremoniously drops the book beside it, kicking up some dust in the process. It\u2019s a large book\u2014a tome, even, bound in purple letter and quite thick. It is none other than Wes\u2019 Grand Compendium of Summoning, by Wes the Wizard, legendary summoner of an age long past. As far as Naoki is aware, only three copies exist today, and she owns all of them. None are available to the public, as Wes\u2019 Compendium is an exceptionally dangerous book, even as books of dark magic go. Because not only does Wes\u2019 Compendium go on about the theory of summoning and the magical principles involved, it also provides step-by-step instructions that anyone can follow, regardless of any magical talent or lack thereof.Using a bookmark she placed earlier, Naoki turns to the relevant chapter. Chapter 17: Making Polite Requests of Those Otherworldly Entities With Whom You Have Already Built Some Rapport. After skimming the preface she locates the instructions. Running her finger down the page, she reads over the instructions once more and checks that she brought all of the requisite materials. Chalk: red, white, and black. Check. Ritual candles x15. Check, with extras.Incense: bayberry for asserting control, and cinnamon for lust. Check, and check.Nightshade oil. Check.A handful of chromium dust. Check.Ground roots of a bilberry bush. Check. Maybe not enough, but check.And a dash of oregano, check.Satisfied that she has all she needs, the Naoki spends the next half-hour preparing the ritual. Drawing the lines, arranging the candles, setting up the incense, making sure that everything that's supposed to be on fire is, and vice-versa. Only half of these preparations are strictly necessary\u2014the altar itself is doing most of the work, but it\u2019s Naoki\u2019s thought that if it\u2019s worth performing a demonic summoning ritual, it\u2019s worth performing a demonic summoning ritual well, and that means going all-out on the thematics.Once she\u2019s finished, Naoki surveys her work and compares it to the descriptions in Wes\u2019 Compendium. The shapes are aligned properly, the candles are where they ought to be, and she didn\u2019t forget the oregano. Some of Wes\u2019theorems have since been outdated and Naoki has modified the ritual significantly to suit her purposes, but it seems right. \u2026 More or less. Then it is time to begin. After removing her clothing and placing it on the table, Naoki approaches the altar with one of the candles. Stepping carefully as not to ruin any of her straight lines, she extends the candle up to the center of the altar and uses it to light the last unlit candle in the center ring. Immediately, the innermost series of runes burst into flame for an instant, then begin to glow. Like ripples in a pond, the other runes come alight and begin to glow in a similar manner. Naoki steps back hurriedly, holding her tail high as not to have it set alight (again). After only a few moments, all of the runes are glowing, and some of them begin to rise and move about.  Things to feel\u2026 warmer as lust magic suffuses the room, and an unnatural wind begins to blow, threatening to extinguish the candles. Naoki takes this to mean it\u2019s working.Rather than chanting, Naoki opted to write her message in runes\u2014that\u2019s the outermost ring. The message is supposed to translate to, \u201cIf you would please, send me another tentacle beast. I enjoyed the last one very much, thank you,\u201d but she suspects she may have botched the grammar. Suddenly, with an all-too-loud noise, space itself cracks. Light refracts in indescribable ways as Naoki attempts perceive that which isn\u2019t there. That would be the portal, she supposes.

A freestanding fireplace and multiple couches, chairs, and tables furnish the room; thick fur rugs line the floor in strategic places. The hues of the oak and cedar boards paneling the room are darker than in the rest of The Chalet, but lighter by several shades than the mahogany and dark oak scheme of the Midnight Sun. The walls are tastefully adorned with paintings. In one corner of the room sits an unusual furnishing - a tree. A quarter of the top portion of a mighty oak, where the branches start, has been felled, trimmed, treated, and placed in the corner. Thick limbs, stripped of bark and cured, run into the room, rising and spreading to meet the angles of the ceiling, where they are continued in a masterful mural depicting a view of the night sky from under a bare-limbed tree. Several forks and some of the more horizontal branches look like they would be particularly well suited to sitting on. Small magical lamps hang on strings draped among the branches, glowing and twinkling like little stars.There are five doors in the walls of this central room - three on the left wall, as viewed from the door, one on the right, and one on the far wall. The door in the right wall leads to the study. A line of windows along the far wall overlooks the lake and lets natural light into the room. Under the windows and continuing around the left wall of the room runs a single desk, books littered sporadically on its surface. The proper home of those books is with many of their fellows on the set of bookshelves running part of the right wall, next to a set of organizer shelves and boxes. A stand-alone circular fireplace occupies the middle of the room, along with several exceptionally comfortable-looking armchairs, two circular tables, and dark red upholstered chairs to go with them. Luxurious carpet covers the floor. The whole atmosphere is cozy and inviting, the perfect place to curl up with a book and watch the snow fall outside.The door in the far end of the common room leads to the bedroom, which is dominated by a large four-poster bed, hung with red velvet curtains that could easily fit four people. In the middle of the back wall, a large bay window, the shelf of which is large enough to sit in comfortably, provides a stunning panoramic view of the mountains, forest, and lake. The window is flanked on either side by a small fireplace flattening the corner of the room. The luxurious carpet from the study is duplicated in the bedroom. Paintings of various sizes adorn the walls, with the exception of one conspicuously bare spot. A small bookshelf, a table and two chairs, a wardrobe, and a dresser complete the room\u2019s furnishings. A door in the right wall of the bedroom leads to the bathroom. Done primarily in blue slate with dark paneled walls, the main feature of the bathroom is a tub that\u2019s very nearly large enough to swim in.There is a door in the right wall of the bedroom which is currently locked, although no keyhole is visible.Proceeding inside, Naoki is careful to make sure the door shuts all the way behind them. Disregarding the doors on the left and right, Naoki continues through the door on the far wall, into the bedroom. There, she makes a presenting gesture; this is the bedroom.

Something was emerging-growing- building within the room making the other resident feel very much smaller and at the mercy of the force as it grew. The demonic tentacles seemed to pulse and hum with some unknown energy as they began to coalesce around the Koitika's small form- the source of the great force. The pentagrams inscribed onto her eyes began to glow with a strange eerie light, nearly hypnotizing  Naoki, bringing into a dull trance before the connection was broken.

The aura still permeated the room, the air growing thick with a rosy scent that dimmed and heightened the senses at the same time. The cocoon pulsed slowly, growing- growing-growing to what seemed an impossible size for the doll-like figure that had been inside. The exhibition was not solely for show though as Naoki would learn as with just seconds passing, the aura and energy that had clouded the room receded only to surge back outwards as the tentacles parted slowly. The wave struck with a dizzying, disorienting force as slowly the transformed demoness emerged. A pair of pale long legs emerged slowly, trailing up into a figure that seemed impossibly immaculate, without a blemish. The smooth skin was undisrupted, not by clothes or even a belly button as a woman emerged, smiling coyly, the same piercing violet eyes staring back at Naoki, the pentagram's stars broken in her eyes. It would be impossible to put the woman who stood lightly on the bed and the doll-like figure in the same grouping- much less establish them as the same person, but it wasn't as if Koitika gave her much of an opportunity to ponder it as her lengthened tentacles slithered forward, taking Naoki by each limb, easily hoisting her up and bringing her flush to her burning flesh.

The reason that I get up in the morning and do things is that I only have but so many mornings to do things with! Since my life is finite, it is my responsibility to do with it what I want. I am motivated by a sense of compassion for my fellow man, which is rooted in the idea that all of our collective lives are finite and we must work together to make them as good as we can. I am motivated by my sense of duty to the Isran people because I have assumed responsibility for their lives and it is thus my responsibility to do well by them,\" she continues. \"I desire power not for its own sake, but for the power to do as I\u2019d like with my life, and the lives of those I am responsible for.\u201d\u201cAll of these feelings are predicated on my being mortal \u2014 and that\u2019s why you don\u2019t feel them,\u201d Naoki continues, sticking one accusatory finger at Grandma. \u201cIf something were to happen to me, you would be upset not out of the compassion humans feel for one another, but because I was useful to you!\u201d She nearly spits.Then she catches herself. \u201c... Which is not to say that I harbor any ill-feelings against you,\u201d Naoki clarifies, aware of her tone. \u201cI continue to appreciate all that you have done, I mean no insult in saying any of this, apologize for taking that tone with you, don\u2019t hold who you are against you, and all of that.\u201d\u201cBut,\u201d She continues, sighing, \u201cThat\u2019s the way it is.\u201d\u201cAnd, respectfully, I don\u2019t want to be like you. I want to remain mortal because I want to continue to feel. All of those human feelings of caring, greed, love, duty, anguish? I live on those feelings, and I thrive on the fulfillment derived from them. To lose that would be to lose that which makes me, me. Who I am and my reason for being.\u201dShe pauses.\u201cNow, admittedly, I\u2019ll likely end up staying a good bit longer than is my fair share,\u201d she concedes, \u201cBut I can\u2019t live forever. I don\u2019t want to accrue incredible power or rule the world \u2014 that\u2019s not what I\u2019m about. The idea of watching the world age and pass me by as I remain the same, an immortal observer, is appalling. ... I fear becoming immortal because I have nothing to gain and everything to lose. There\u2019s no good reason to,\u201d she concludes, shrugging.

Why do such feelings motivate you to make certain choices? Because it makes you feel good. Why do I search for knowledge and power? Because it makes me feel good. Countless reasons and excuses can be conjured, but I believe they all lead back to this singular point. Selflessness, noble sacrifices, martyrdom,\u00a0PAH!\u201d Waving her hand as if to dismiss the very idea, Grandma beings to pace back and forth. \u201cImagine if the girl you were fifteen years ago could hear you now? The most powerful ruler in all the Overworld explaining how they don\u2019t desire power \u2018for its own sake\u2019!
