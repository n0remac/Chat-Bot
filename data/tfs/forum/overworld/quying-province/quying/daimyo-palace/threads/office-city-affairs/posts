Large gilded doors allow the city's most prominent officials and merchants access to a large room full of hardworking clerks and scribes, each of whom does their utmost best to impress their superiors and get work done. A hostess sits at the front, greeting those who enter with an eerily perfect smile and a small hand wave, honed to perfection from years of doing nothing but that. The reception area has a small tray of cookies and some tea for those who are waiting to partake in. Anybody who wishes to reserve warehouse space or stall space in the market district, or purchase/rent land, will need to come through this office at some point in the process.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "This is by far the largest office inside the administrative buildings in the outskirts of the palace.
