The few merchants that do deal in foreign goods often negotiate their own deals, as the items they bring in are seldomly traded in any sort of regula interval.Inside the cramped space is a small, messy desk, with two small chairs situated against the wall, one of which prevents the door from fully opening all the way.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Until recently, the Quying Office of Foreign Affairs primarily dealt with the housing and feeding of castaways and shipwrecked survivors until they could find a captain willing to take them home or decided to integrate into the society here.
