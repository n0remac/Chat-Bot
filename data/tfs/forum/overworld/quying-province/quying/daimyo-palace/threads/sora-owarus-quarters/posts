Her cat eyes laughed in the darkness, ears flattened against the black silk of her hair as jade claws slipped from her fingers and she scaled the wall as easily as a joke. Although she wanted to admire the view of the first curtain wall of the Daimyo's palace, she didn't, knowing that the clouds that covered the moon for these spare moments would not hide her for long. The Jade Cat slipped down to the ground and all but flew over the courtyard to one of the decorative trees there. She scaled up its trunk as if the pull of gravity didn't apply to her, leaves gently shaking as she went from branch to branch -- and then stopped on a dime.Here, she could admire the view -- the way the sea beyond Quying sparkled like glass, the way the rooftops of the Daimyo's palace looked like cranes in flight, the way the silver light of the moon danced like mist over the rooftops that made the Merchant's City, lanterns hanging like lightning bugs every so often. It was a pretty sight, and her ears twitched a moment, her tail swaying for a moment with the serenity of it.But peace never lasted, at least, not where the Jade Cat was. A black mask upon the Cat's face, a cloth wrapped around the bottom portion of it, her Cheshire grin was hidden as she saw the winged tip of a rooftop far from the tree -- at least, far for human standards.The agile strength of her body coiled in her limbs, and she made the daring leap -- the danger that she might not make it only making her heart pound with exhilaration rather than fear. But of course, she did make it, for she was The Cat of Quying, and the luck was on her side.The black-clad thief landed upon the tiles there and rolled for a moment, the quiet thumps of her landing not lasting for long. By the make and build of the rooftop she was on, by the reasoning that the walls and screens were not ornamented, this was not a building she wanted to enter, and so she was up on her nimble feet and with a feline quickness she raced -- quietly -- over the tiles and vaulted off the edge.She twisted in mid-air and landed in a long crouch as the shadows lifted off the moon, and she had to hide within the darkness of the stilted walkway to not be seen by another guard. She waited until she heard the footsteps ease away, and then she moved again. She slinked and slid until she saw a servant open one sliding rice screen door, going out for water.The Cat slipped into the Palace proper. The Daimyo's quarters would be up -- high. She should go there. Mmmm, there would be lovely treasure there, no doubt. She began to make her way, when suddenly a screen slid open at the end of the hall!The Cat reached for the first screen near her and let it whisper open, tumbling lithely inside and halting on a dime, carefully sliding the panel closed so by the time the sleepy samurai who was going out for... some reason... walked by the room the Cat was now in, the door was closed.She took stock of her surroundings, and then her ears perked up when she saw she must have been in a warrior's room.Interesting.There must be masterwork katana nearby. That made her tail twitch and another smile tip her lips. Why not? The Daimyo wasn't going anywhere soon... She slipped to the other doors of the room, those that led to the warrior's bedroom, and she quietly... quietly... slid it open.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "She was a shadow on the ground, thrill down her spine and eagerness in the sleekness of her limbs as she dipped low to remain unseen by a passing guard and then she slipped -- as quiet as a sigh -- toward the wall.
