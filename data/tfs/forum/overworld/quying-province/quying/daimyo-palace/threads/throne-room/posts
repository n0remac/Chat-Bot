The three Samurai that had brought the \"candidates\" here took their appropriate places alongside the throne, amongst the remainder of the Daimyo's Personal Guard.The Head of the Daimyo's Guard was now known as The Chosen of the Wavewarden. Blessed by the Guardian of the Sea herself, he bore no personal banner save for the Rune of the Wavewarden, which pulsated dimly on his chest. Such magic, for magic it was, was allowed as it had been bestowed on him by a Kami, and they were not bound by the laws of mortal man. He was the right hand of the Daimyo, a cousin who lost his father in the same fight the Daimyo lost his, saving the Daimyo's life and fighting shoulder to shoulder with him to gain their vengeance. The Samurai to the Daimyo's left bore the symbol of the Great White Whale that had terrorized the Bay of Quying for a whole Winter. His legend may be the most popular among the Daimyo's Guard, for he embodies the reckless but lucky hero so popular amongst the common folk. Or perhaps it is because he is of the common folk, a Wave Warrior who took command of his ship when the Captain fell, and led them to victory against the Great Whale, killing it with the Famed Harpoon  Melvinata . The Samurai to the right of the Chosen bore the sign of the Witch Slayer. Alone amongst his unit he had resisted the witchery of the Sea Hag Charybdis, granting each one of his turned brethren an honorable death, a feat great enough on its own to earn him his spot. But the Slayer was not done, tracking the Hag down and driving his blade through her black, icy heart. He, more than any other, hates magic and is often tasked with dealing with magical threats to the City.The remainder were known as The Six, sextuplets born in a city that considered twins to be a blessing of luck. They fought as one, each having an innate understanding of how his brothers would react to a situation, their bonds of trust stronger than the steel in their blades. They were Wave Warriors aboard the Daimyo's father's ship when he was slain, and they alone survived, defending the body of his father from dishonorable desecration and giving the Daimyo time to avenge him. Such were their legends, and many were their deeds since then. It was from them that the Daimyo would receive advice on his choice of wife, for once betrothed, she would enter into their protection as well.The Daimyo was aware of each advantage and disadvantage politically that each candidate possessed should he choose them. The Ryoichi Family were natives of Quying, and no Daimyo in Quying had ever taken a foreign wife. They knew all the customs and traditions of the nation, and the marriage would solidify their loyalty. However, it would also increase their prestige and power, and provide his own House with greater competition. The Rondian's advantage lay in their aplearance and presentation. In spite of his presently well-groomed appearance, the Daimyo would oft attend meetings in a similarly sea-stained state. The curiosity of the woman was plain to see, and it matched him well for he was also a curious man, possessed of a love for learning nearly as strong as his love for the Sea. An alliance with the City of Rondon was less desirable than the political  benefits of the other choices. The Sakandi had already impressed with their willingness to properly observe the customs of his court. Their city was on the sea, just as Quying was, and he had already met Fairuz, indeed the pair had gotten along well at the Isran Festival. An Alliance with the City would be most lucrative for Quying, but they were under the yoke of Isra, which could create problems in the future, or assist in his own ambitions...The Daimyo greeted each of them in turn, waiting until all had arrived but greeting them in order of arrival.\"Yuudai Ryoichi, an honor to have you before me for such an event. Your House has always been amongst the most loyal, and my father considered you to be a friend. Upon the conclusion of this, I wish to discuss with you recent events, including the results of my visit to Isra, prior to presenting them to the Council as a whole.\" An honor for certain, to be confided in before others.\"Lord Cordoba, I welcome you to my City, and trust that the journey was not too harsh. I desire to explore further relations between the two cities regardless of my choice, and hope that you feel the same.\" An earnest request, for the Daimyo knew little of Rondon.\"Emissary Jemil, I welcome you to my City as well, and hope the journey was not overly arduous. When last I met with Emira Fairuz, I promised her several examples of literature and art, those are in the process of being gathered now, and will be sent home with you.\" A discussion of trade could wait until his upcoming visit to Sakand, something the Emissary was no doubt aware of.With the greetings completed, he addressed the matter at hand. Or rather, The Chosen did, stepping forward to deliver the first set of instructions.\"The Daimyo desires for each candidate, and only the candidate, to make their case.

Although the women of the Ryoichi were easy to read -- all of them quiet, fluttering little birds -- the patriarch was a harder mark to tell.At dinner, the Sakandi entourage talked quietly amongst themselves, too much of a cultural barrier between their homeland and this new, entirely exotic one. The Sakandi had become used to the barrier with Isra and their pale-skinned people.

Jamil bowed his head to him. \"The Emira will be most pleased of your decision, Daimyo,\" Jamil said, refraining from mentioning that a message had already been sent to the Emira via majic. \"She is no doubt pleased that Lady Asherah has so far found Quying to be welcoming, and that you seem to have found pleasure in Lady Asherah.

The time passed where all who had journeyed had a chance to 'unwind', either by napping, meditating, bathing, or exploring the City of Quying.As Lady Asherah promised, dinner was a small affair, located back in the throne room. There were traditional Quy dishes, two Tawakoshi dishes that Asherah thought might be more familiar to Kiri, and one Sakandi dish that was her favorite, a \"kebab\" of sorts of livestock that had been imported to Quying from Sakand as a gift from Emira Fairuz during Akagi and Asherah's wedding.They were seated around the table, just them, and Lady Asherah was draped in one of the silks that Kiri had brought for her, the sea greens and blues complimenting the golden tan of her skin beautifully.
