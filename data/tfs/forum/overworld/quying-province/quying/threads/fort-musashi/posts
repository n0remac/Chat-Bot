It sits perfectly opposite to the massive palace across the harbor, and provides protection to this side. It is here that the forces of the City of Quying\u00a0(different from the more traditional samurai structure followed by the Daimyo's personal soldiers) marshal and train in times of war and peace. A hefty arsenal is kept here, numerous lots of ammunition to outfit the warships and armed merchant ships that serve the city. Pirates attempting to raid the city are their usual suspects, and the siege weaponry mounted on the walls of the fort can dominate anything attempting to enter the harbor by force. Should an enemy fleet attempt to enter the fort, or if it needs to be blocked off for any reason, there is a massive chain that stretches from the bottom of the fort to the palace, and once that is raised no ship can enter or exit the port.No beaches exist alongside the fort, the only land access being through the heavily defended Military Dockyards. That particular passageway can be flooded at the threat of invasion, and it is winding enough to make swimming it impossible without magical means, if one can find their way through it.\u00a0Inside the fort resides the Quying\u00a0military's soldiers, and their families, if they so choose. Small markets for food and produce exist within, giving tax-free discounts to the soldiers and their families, as well as offering a rotating selection of goods depending on warehouse surpluses and the fickleness of merchants. There is even a small school, satellite campus to the larger one near the palace, that hosts some of the basic classes for the soldiers and their children.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://imgur.com/TVV2AJ8.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://imgur.com/TVV2AJ8.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/></div>"}, "post-57031": {"user": "City of Quying", "user_num": 1703, "timestamp": "1480507436000", "message": "The Guards hauled @adams into the fort, the small handcart containing their personal belonging trundling along behind them.
