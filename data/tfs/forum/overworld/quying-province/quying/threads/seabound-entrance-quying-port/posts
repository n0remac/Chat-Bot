He knew not a single soul from Tawakoshi.\u00a0When it was his turn to present his papers, he would step forward, presenting them immediately to whoever asked. He quite disliked this notion as he did so, being forced to wait in line behind these people he saw as below himself, and being required to present papers like all the rest. Still, he had no claim here, as he was from Katashima, not Tawakoshi. It was then that he thought of his daisho, a wakizashi and katana that hung at his hip as it had always since he became a samurai.\u00a0In the eyes of these people he perhaps did not earn the right to wear those blades as a foreigner, he thought.

Though one ship does not remain in line with its fellows, The Scrutiny outpaces the rest, as to proceed into the harbor alone- though still not at any speed. The Scrutiny is the flagship of The Isran Empire ; it is built just as an Isran warship but is instead an unarmed exploratory vessel. Today, it carries not just members of the Expeditionary Force, but others. Others, including none other than Her Imperial Highness, The Princess Skarlet , visiting for her reasons. Others, including Ryden Greyiron , leading an embassy on diplomatic business. The ship sits metaphorically low in the water, weighted with such figures.The Empress has mandated that both The Princess and The Chancellor must be accompanied by a guard of her choosing for the duration of their visit. Other guards are present, and the two are encouraged to direct them as they see fit, but the one designated must remain in their presence. On its way in, The Scrutiny attempts to make contact with whatever port authorities may be present to facilitate its goal of docking.

Of course, other than an incidental and fleeting occurrence in the same room as the Daimyo during the Festival of Prospernalia, this would be the chancellor's first encounter with the people of Quying, and the Isran Empire's first official diplomatic mission to Quying, and as such, they were there to project a message - one that would be self-evident to any onlookers, so Ryden was accompanied by the finest members of the Citadel Guard, who had been delegated to accompany him and ensure his safety. He didn't expect any trouble, but in the realm of security, it paid not to be complacent. He gazed across the expansive bay at the flotilla approaching, appraising the collection of Quy soldiers and staff collected on the decks of the ship before moving on to assess the ship itself, and then the landscape beyond them.
