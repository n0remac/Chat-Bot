In her honor, they constructed a temple near the city to praise the great dragon who protected the rivers and seas of the world. This temple stands even to this day, built into the cliff that borders the ocean, so that its buildings are just above the high-tide line and the reach of waves from powerful storms. Its hallways are filled with rooms for study, meditation, and habitation by the priests and priestesses, and many of these halls are filled with a wonder unique to Quying and the temple: Glass-walled aquariums filled with unique underwater flora and fauna from the seas around Tawakoshi.The true gem of the temple, however, lies behind a door deep in the temple's heart. Adorned with unique blue-and-green rock in the shape of the Wavewarden who blessed the priests and priestesses so long ago, this door leads to a stairwell that spirals down through the cliff and into a hallway that leads into the ocean itself. This hallway ends in a room created entirely from glass, offering an unimpeded view of the ocean around it. No one knows how this area was created, though many believe it was made by the magic of the Wavewarden. It is in this room that the Miko Hikari Saito, the High Priestess of this temple, offers her prayers to the Wavewarden, hoping that she will one day return to Quying and bless them once more.", "link_list": ["/user/1941"], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/yDAdeei.jpg", "http://i.imgur.com/uFDwUWp.jpg"], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/yDAdeei.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/></div>"}, "post-57378": {"user": "Sora Owaru", "user_num": 946, "timestamp": "1480791365000", "message": "The young samurai would find himself approaching the temple of yhe wavewarden.
