It is here that the massive fishing fleet of Quying resides, and every morning there is a mass exodus of them, mimicking a school of fish as they funnel through the relatively small opening. They return in much smaller groups throughout the day, depending on their luck with rod and reel or net that day.\u00a0The wharves themselves hold the docking, repair, and off-loading locations for the fishing vessels, as well as all the places they process or keep the fish/crustaceans. It is a fairly seedy location, especially at night, and visitors to the city will be warned to stay away at night, lest they become another victim of crime.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://imgur.com/p8rNDIC.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://imgur.com/p8rNDIC.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/><br/></div>"}}
