Instead, it offers lifelong companions.Taiyang, a new merchant in Quying backed by the Daimyo himself, has appeared with his Home for Marvelous Companions, packed with smartly trained dogs for every kind of job. They can hunt, they can fetch, they can protect, and most importantly, they can offer their loyalty and an undying bond known by few men.The companions range anywhere from fierce Quying mountain dogs to swift Kiyonai shibas and everything in between. If you need a job done right, get a Companion to do it for you!Normally the man sitting at the stall is Taiyang Yamada himself. He seems completely at home nestled among the ten, twenty, forty dogs he has with him, and seems at least a little hesitant to let them go once he deems someone worthy enough to adopt a companion.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://www.desktx.cc/d/file/phone/game/20170803/small9d62f929cc0fb903d3993649513ef01b.jpg"], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://www.desktx.cc/d/file/phone/game/20170803/small9d62f929cc0fb903d3993649513ef01b.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/></div>"}, "post-91492": {"user": "Yasuke Shisou", "user_num": 2496, "timestamp": "1560971773000", "message": "\"Dogs..?
