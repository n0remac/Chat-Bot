Otherwise, it was only his second wife, and his middle-daughter who returned into the house, their faces solemn. They had still not entirely gotten over how quickly Daimyo Akagi Zuikaku had dismissed their efforts to marry Miyuri to Akagi. Although Miyuri hadn't wanted to marry the Daimyo, she had been prepared to do her duty and her ego and pride were a little hurt that the Daimyo had so quickly let her out of his sight...... all for that foreign woman in the veils and the gold, with skin as dark as bark and an accent that was strange and ugly. At least to Yuudai's ears. The women stayed inside for most of the day, occasionally traveling through the gardens, but Yuudai left shortly after for business with his retinue of guard.Mostly the estate was busy with the comings and goings of all the servants and the like who were busy making sure that everything was run smoothly, and that was the estate itself was well-kept. About an hour before sundown, Yuudai returned with his guards and entered into the house. He was inside for a few hours more, dark having settled upon the estate.Lanterns were lit all among the outer hallways and within the gardens. The women went to their rooms to sleep, but Yuudai... Yuudai dismissed his guards for a moment and went to the pagoda in his estate, took out his slender pipe and rested.

Once he was within a few feet, he would rise from his crouched position, blade still in his hand as he seemed to relax a bit, \"Lord Ryoichi... what a pleasure it is on this peaceful night,\" he said quietly, almost peaceful and tranquil sounding in the way he spoke, which contrasted heavily with the blade he held in his hand.
