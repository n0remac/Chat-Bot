She had been blessed\u00a0by the Wavewarden, which had gone a long way in having such a foreign people accept the desert beauty, but once she had had her wedding night with Akagi, it was as if the next morning she became a different person.No, no, not so much different\u00a0as she was... assertive. The veils were gone, and it was a physical gesture as well as a real one to see the captivating creature beneath, and the true shine of her personality that Akagi had glimpsed before in subtle glances and soft gestures. On that Blessed Night, the Daimyo's young wife had been energetic, and ah, urgent, and... uniquely inventive. The Sakandi people were, after all, a very sensual and affectionate people.The next morning, Lady Asherah did not don the veils so many had become accustomed to see her in, hiding her away from everyone, but instead wore a very unique gown. It was a mixture of the Quy kimono and the Sakandi saree, using the beautifully painted and decorated Quy silks to wrap herself in and drape over her shoulder. Beneath it, she wore a long sleeved shirt with cuffs that were tight to her wrists, aware that the Quy people had a certain level of modesty\u00a0that the Sakandi did not observe, but the back\u00a0of the shirt was left bare, showing off her beautiful shoulder blades.She ordered that from now on, all Sakandi women would dress in this manner, and showed how all Sakandi men would dress -- in a kimono-like robe that was hit them just above their knee, a sash at their waist, and flowing trousers. It was a mixture of her culture and Akagi's, and as she told the foreigners that had traveled with her or come, it would be a symbol of their joining nations.She sent out more edicts as well to her gathering of people, further informing them of Quy culture, and also informing them that she was going to have a Sakand Quarter built in Quying (with the permission of her husband, of course).\u00a0It was a few weeks later, actually, that put her here, on the Market Street, in front of an alley that had been broadened to be the official entrance\u00a0into the Sakand Quarter\u00a0where scaffolding and majic\u00a0was flowing to get things properly built. She was standing with a gathering of people, some Sakandi, some Quy, and had her beautiful head bent to look at the schematics and plans.The Sakand Quarter was already heavily underway. Some buildings had been deemed good enough to live in, even if finishing touches were not yet set in place, so a majority of the Sakandi immigrants were already settling in. The Quy people didn't quite know what to make of the Daimyo's bride. She was beautiful, yes, if you liked skin \"that\" dark, and she was bold, showing off the back of her neck and her back like geisha.\u00a0But mostly, it was the majic\u00a0that flowed from the Sakandi, golden and different\u00a0from that which came from the Wavewarden.

Springtime is well upon us and as such comes the cherry blossoms. The pink gently flowers have started to grace the uniformed line of trees that stretch the length of the market. Ky at first did come here to look for goods, but this seemed much more interesting. He had just come from doing some light morning training and hasn't even removed the fingerless gloves he uses.

Similar to himself, they both have features that make them look younger than they truly are. Ky at first glance mistook this stranger for a child in his early teen years. Not that Ky didn't trust the young lad, it was best to keep an eye out on strangers.
