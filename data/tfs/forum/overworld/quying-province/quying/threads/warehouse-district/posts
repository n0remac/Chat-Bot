The warehouses are owned by the city, and any who wish to rent one for storing goods may do so by inquiring at the palace. The rates are very reasonabke and most of the warehouse managers can inform you as to what they are. The money provided goes to maintenance and upkeep of the district, as well as to the Daimyo's education fund for the poorer members of his city.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://imgur.com/DVHSWaA.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://imgur.com/DVHSWaA.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/></div>"}}
