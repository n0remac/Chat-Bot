It wasn't often Satsuki got much time to herself anymore. Life at sea was a constant commotion, and while her promotion to captain had granted her a little cabin to call her own, she rarely got more than a few hours to herself. When she returned to Quying on leave, it was usually to stay with family, which meant that they were fervent about spending every moment she had at their side, particularly her mother, who surprisingly had grown quite a soft, sweet spot for her only daughter since she began to spend so much time away from home, in stark contrast to the harsh, cold face she received from the woman in her youth. Perhaps she had proven herself enough, or perhaps her current unavailability had changed her mother's perspective. In any case, while it was nice to be wanted and loved, it was tiring to spend every waking moment with half a dozen people chattering in her ear. The empty bar at late night izakaya was a welcome change of pace.For once, the admiral had actually made an appearance in more casual attire, nursing a cup of warm sake cloaked in a simple blue yukata with thin, white stripes. The mix of warm alcohol and the cool evening air was a refreshing sensation. She had a few days stay over in Quying while a large trade fleet prepared to make the journey to Isra, she would be overseeing said transport. The timing was just right for respite hours like these, her parents not nagging her to spend the evening at home with them because she would be up and out the door in a manner of hours as it was. She reveled in the simple silence, but it would not last.The cloth flaps which draped across the entrance to the pub flipped and fluttered as someone entered. The sleepy call of her cousin behind the counter giving a half-hearted welcome drew her attention to the new arrival. Her eyes turned to the open doorway, wondering who had wandered in this time of night. She prayed it wasn't someone from one of her crews. She didn't mind company, as long as it didn't come with the baggage of social expectations. Fortunately the stranger's face was wholly unfamiliar to her. Satsuki watched expectantly for the new arrival to take a seat nearby, her focus returning to her cup as she took another generous sip of the rice wine.
