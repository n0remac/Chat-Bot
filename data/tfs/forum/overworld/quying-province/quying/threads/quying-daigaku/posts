The University here pays for the poorer children to attend, thanks to some of the fees and taxis levied on foreign merchants. The schooling provided is relative to one's intended job, which is usually whatever their parents do, all though exceptions are made for those granted the opportunity by benefactors or joining the military forces of Quying. The school also contains the Military's officer academy, as many of the classes overlap. The school is located on a massive campus that used to be part of the Palace, until it was converted to this use by the current Daimyo of Quying, Akagi Zuikaku, and is now located a smallways down Market Street from the current palace.Any foreigners wishing to enroll in the school may inquire about doing so at the Palace as well, and any student or faculty will usually be more than happy to point the inquirer in the right direction.For the most part, classes are segregated by social standing, regardless of the student's home. The only exception to this is the military classes, where are all of the cadets are treated equally.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://imgur.com/yc2kwB1.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://imgur.com/yc2kwB1.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/></div>"}}
