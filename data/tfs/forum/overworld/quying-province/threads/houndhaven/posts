The youngest of his generation, Taiyang has taken to raising an ungodly amount of dogs to protect the field and fill the emptiness of its rolling hills. Many have a penchant for sniffing out the oni that had been known to roam these lands, keeping the most dangerous of them at bay.Their house is humble, but pleasant. Warm in the winter and cool during the summers, the few rooms in the house are easy to regulate and keep clean despite the incredible amount of fur that gets in every crevice and crack.In the past it was known as the Yamada Estate. Now, it is known as Houndhaven.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/l8TQu10.png"], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/l8TQu10.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/></div>"}}
