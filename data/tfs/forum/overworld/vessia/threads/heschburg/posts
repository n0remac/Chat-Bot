It had been quite a while since he had enjoyed a 'royal supper'.  As he began to fix his plate one thing that the maids might would notice was the lack of any prayer beforehand.  Adrian had, after all, lost his faith over the years.  Grace was never present during the family's stay at Himmel Hutte, so it didn't even cross the Count's mind here.  Perhaps some of the more ambitious and cunning maidens took special notice...Adrian raised his spoon to his lips, testing the temperature before turning it up.  The bread went well with the stew.  Fortunately the girls had also provided wine which Adrian used to wash down the food.  All in all it was a delicious, filling, and well-wanted meal.\"It's great!\" he commented.  \"But it doesn't compare to your meals,\" he winked at his wife as he took a sip of wine.  \"Frontier towns tend to draw lots of adventurers, explorers, and their kind.  Huntsmen included.  In the past Heschburg has drawn many talented hunters to the frontier, who sought to ply their trade selling the meats and pelts of the game they've killed.  They could usually be found in the market selling their boons.  I've no doubt that with the resettlement of Heschburg the huntsmen have returned, so they may be able to provide us with fresh game meat.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"You're back!\" Adrian turned his attention away from Adolphus and to his wife.
