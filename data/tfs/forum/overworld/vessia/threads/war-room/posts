It would be a grave mistake to assume just because he had the appearance of idleness about him that his mind was also idle, however. The entrance of Aurelia\u2019s servant was a curious matter. He certainly hadn\u2019t entered this meeting simply to notify them the food and drink was available. The arrival of Vahlent von Rexus and his bid for Emperor was a slightly surprising development. While he wasn\u2019t entirely opposed to having another Rexus on the throne, it wouldn\u2019t be the Archduke\u2019s first choice. It was also a good thing he was skilled at keeping a straight face, less he laughed in the face of Johann as the made his bid for Emperor. The man was an absolute pig and if he managed to win the bid, the Archduke might be inclined to take a rather long vacation\u2026Deciding he had watched in silence for long enough, the Archduke slowly rose from his chair, staff in one hand.

If only you damn well knew. \"Yes, Empress, I thank you for cherishing the memory of Alexei and I agree it is bold. But, boldness is something an Emperor needs would you not agree?\" He queried, before turning to the company at large. \"Alexander was not of course wholly representative of our House, he was in many ways contrary to what we desired and thus I can reliably promise to do what all here appreciated once more, whilst getting rid of his failings. I'm sure some here would find that endearing in an Emperor.\" he stated, looking to Isenbardus with a hint. But just as he did so the Archduke rose, with his own proposition. He smiled ever so slightly, looking to the Empress as Isenbardus finished. \"Curious, and in its own way understandable.
