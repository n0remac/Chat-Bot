Naturally, more danger meant more pay.  It wasn't uncommon for these slayers to band together for a higher chance of survival, but that meant dividing shares of the reward.  An individual had to weigh their options: taking into consideration the danger and the reward.

Angelo's policy, however, was that there was safety in numbers - after all, dead men can spend coin.Already with Minerva at his side the rewards would be split 50/50.  Another member of the party would cut the reward down to a third.  But as mentioned, Angelo was more concerned about his survival.

They sought to deny him his birthright, but they would need to replace him with a candidate the Berglanders would support.

Those owing him a blood oath drew their blades as expected but more were needed. Many wanting the violence to simply stop believed him to be the lesser of evils (given he was defender), while those who saw or heard of his slaughter of the greenskins joined him unsure of if because impressed or fearful. Then there were simply the staunch royalists, one of whom was Alphons Morgenstern. An old man, he had served dutifully in the Imperial army, meriting in action the position given to him by noble nepotism. He was called the Mad because of the impossibly brave, at times often stupidly agressive maneuvers he would make. Yet the fact he lived to his old age is testament to the fact his command only found success in spite of the insanity of how he did battle. Returning to the civilian life back in his home Bergland after retiring at fifty-nine much of the Augustgradischer ways had rubbed off on him, but he was nevertheless loyal to his Elector until his last old bone would be dust. Upon hearing of the rebellion he was outraged, and with a mixture of his own funds, charisma, and contacts had mustered a non-insignificant force. They were a total three-hundred, assembled with three separate and equal in size units. First were the Morgenstern guard, men hired by the family to guard the castle and region around it, as well as being the main force he had in disputed with other nobles. They had heavy plate helmets, gloves, and sabatons, but the rest of the body was covered in a simple uniform rather than any armour; a large shield was supposed to protect that, instead, while short spears equally adeot in dealing with cavalry and infantry were their main arms. Then came the local lads convinced to come forth. They were mostly huntsmen, lumberjacks, or just thugs with hearts of gold. They all had composite bows and civilian side arms like cleavers, hammers, or just heavy sticks. Rather importantly they jad mounts of ponies, donkeys, and mules; beasts that would go only a few paces faster than a man, rather than tools of real cavalry. But in Berglander tradition they weren't used to actually charge or move about in battle, rather helping men move in and out of positions such that they stay fresh rather than exhausting themselves marching and running. Finally were the veterans. Old men like Alphons, not one was younger than forty. But they all had served and they all had bits of their pasts to bring along in a motley crew. One fellow boasted full plate armour from head to toe, even if for a weapon he carried an oar for a boat nail hammered into the end. A different one had a heavy windlass crossbow made for piercing armour from his old days that had been converted to shoot stones for hunting rather than bolts for war, but it was a fearsome beast nonetheless. One former Witch Hunter had a rapier he had to combine with a rolling pin rather than han a parrying dagger, while another bugger carried a zweihander with a bucket for helmet and thousands of fishing hooks stuck in a net for improvised chainmail. With this army of country bumpkins at his side the (in?)famous General rode towards the capital, a tattered old flag of the Empire in one hand and a bugle in the other. He knew at his age his contribution of men would be more valuable than his military wisdom in the eyes of many, but then again he didn't know how many Berglander officers defected to the rebels, and thus how in demand his old-timey strategy would be.

Most citizens, of course, were loyal, but there would always be dissenters and he refused to leave any room for mistakes.He had called for an early morning meeting with his advisers to discuss Reinhart\u2019s rebellion.  Many of them were in favor of shoring up defenses in Augendorf and waiting for the usurper to make his move.  It was a defensive posture, and one the Count did not like.  From his perspective it made him look weak.The truth was that Elric was angry and he wanted to take the fight to Reinhart.  His approach was an aggressive one: to besiege, and perhaps storm the walls of Volksburg.  But it was risky.  Any assault on the walls would result in heavy casualties.  Then there was the danger of the secessionists who were coming to Reinhart\u2019s aid.  He planned to besiege Volksburg and destroy the secessionist army at the same time.  He had already sent word out to the countryside to rally his forces.The Augendorf court advised against such a risky campaign and an annoyed Elric dismissed them.  He decided to pace the high stone walls of his city to catch some fresh air and clear his head.  He was accompanied by his aide, Odo.

Meanwhile Odo accompanied Alphons' motley band to their quarters.The castle was quite large: a feat which was easy to accomplish thanks to the rich stone supply that was found throughout the mountains.  The fortification was built long ago by early Vessian lords who sought to project their power in the north and rape the landscape of its resources.  As it expanded into a city, and the lords became wealthy from trade, renovations converted a simple fort into a grand castle.  Thus, depending on where one was, the architecture appeared practical and simple, or lavish and considered.  Nevertheless, it was a bastion of strength, complemented by the mighty stone walls surrounding the city.After passing through the gates and initial rooms, then through the main hall - which was adorned with a throne, artifacts, paintings of past rulers, and royal decor - the Count led Alphons and some guards into a large circular room.  In the center was a map of the Bergland.  There were various figurines placed in various locations on the map depicting the masses of forces which were gathering the region.  Looking around the room Alphons would note the extensive library which the Augendorf Counts had collected.\"Before we begin,\" Elric began, sighing heavily and tiredly as he collapsed into a chair near the map table, \"won't you tell me about a war story?\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"Hmhm,\" Elric let out a laugh.  \"Well, let's hope you keep your boots.\"  The Count began to take a route towards Augendorf's castle.

That's the way it is in this man's army oh yes.\" Alphons had been to the Castle a few times before when he was much younger, but it was no less impressive in his elderly years; what his lost ability to see detracted from was made up for by Imperial innovation in science, technology, and the arts as well as general increases in quality of life. Though the old man had served in the army of the Empire rather than the Electoral Army, he was nevertheless a patriot of his homeland as much as the Empire it was in and he beamed with pride at what the Bergland represented: the mountain born jewel of all Vessia.As the party went through the interior of the Castle Alphons felt the weight of decades upon him be lifted as the great men in portraits and sculpture within bore the weight of centuries and perhaps millennia. He made sure to salute those immortalized figures that he recognized, and he bowed his head lightly to those that he didn't. As they entered the room the retired officer saw that there weren't other commanders about to discuss the future with, and he started to get an inkling as to why he in particular was here. At the request of Elric an eyebrow arose, and he stopped to think for a moment or two.\"Very well my Lord. I am sure I am here because of the many battles I won, but in this room? Let me regale you with how I lost one.\" He wasn't sure if he was understanding things in the senility he was well aware he had, but if he was then he felt it would be a good teaching moment.\"The battle of Rakoszi pass, I think most will call it. Funnily enough it was rather far from the actual Rakoszi pass, but it determined who held the territory. A horde of Eastern savages had amassed in Swavia and I was given command of a formidable force to crush them. Two regiments of Halberdiers clad from head to toe in full plate, a half regiment of Egyszer archers in half-plate and yet another of their horse archers with chain barding on their mounts, a regiment of Westerling pavise crossbows, a volunteer force of Knights from the Order of His Most Holy Burning Blade, and some mercenary Engineers with mangonels and onagers lobbing alchemical flame. Not the largest of forces but an impressive one nonetheless. We arrived to find the foe had overrun Rakoszi past and had marched past it to make sure they would not be bottlenecked there. We wanted to push them back through it and then secure the pass for ourselves, you know how it goes. Well, we got to the planning of our assault you see. I suggested we force-march our men upon the enemy wherein we would strike them whilst they were celebrating their victories and not yet expecting us, the weariness of our men and animals more than made up for in this hypothetical battle by the drunkenness and general unpreparedness of our foe. My fellow officers of course disagreed like the buggers they are. They suggested we send scouts ahead whilst maintaining an orderly march in an ordinary battle. I told them to shut up, and I crushed the enemy. That battle of Rakoszi pass? A decisive victory for the Divine Empire of Vessia. A less recorded battle soon followed it however, Thaddeus's folly. You see though we crushed the army we were ordered to crush, the foe had several small bands coming in to reinforce them upon hearing the warlord's prior victories. They came from all directions but the South-East, though we didn't know this for we had not scouted ahead. We could have escaped encirclement, but alas we were decimated. Thaddeus was not at fault of course, but he was a Sergeant-Major under my command and the only important officer to die... poor bastard's head was mounted on a spike.\"The old man tried to continue speaking, but his mouth had already been failing him for two sentences. He made fleshy noises with his tongue as he tried to moisten his lips but both parties were equally dry. Alphons made a motion for water or some other refreshment, and upon receiving it he would exhale with satisfaction as if he wasn't recounting the gruesome death of his comrades. \"We could have sent men ahead to scout while maintaining the aggressive force march. As an experienced man with clear goals in mind I should have stuck with my first principles and my gut feeling, but though I may reject the ultimate plans of my advisors I should still have listened to their wisdom, and perhaps I could have crushed the barbarian horde by virtue of my methodology without getting my army decimated in the process by virtue of theirs'.\" The previously milky and withered eyes of Alphons suddenly looked aquiline, alert \u2014 they were scanning Elric to see if the moral of the story had gotten to him or not.

Hearing a first-hand account - and from the commander no less - was a treasure.  At the conclusion Elric smiled and nodded: \"it is your experience, my friend, that I value so much.  You knew how to achieve victory, and you achieved it.  And even after Thaddeus' Folly you acknowledged mistakes in hindsight.  I'd dare say few commanders have this trait.  Those who do... well, that's why they live as long as you do.\"The Count turned his attention to the war table.  \"So allow me to explain the situation.  My cousin, Reinhart, attempted to seize Augendorf from me.  But on my return he and his supporters fled the city.  They're holed up in Volksburg,\" Elric pointed to the southernmost fortress that guarded the entrance into the province.  \"This is where Reinhart was raised, so he certainly knows everything there is to know about it.  We can expect him to be well-prepared, and he will not give it up without a fight.\"Also,\" Elric pointed out a specific figure on the map, also near Volksburg.  Iosef Lange... Grandmaster of the Paladins of Saint Engels.\"  He shook his and sighed.  \"The traitor has taken up with my cousin, and they will bolster the resolve of his men.  They do not fear death; they're determined; they're experienced.  I would rather take them alive and attempt to reinstitute them in the city but... only time will tell us their fate.\"And finally, Imperial Secessionists: more traitors.  They're marching from the south and hope to reinforce Reinhart.  If they do then they will outnumber us.  Reinhart will leave the castle and the combined army will destroy us and take Augendorf.  Even if we were expecting Imperial reinforcements Reinhart will have starved most of our citizens to death.  Thus, I aim to march south and lay siege to Volksburg.  I plan to leave a token force there overnight while the rest of our forces march further south and destroy the Secessionists.  By the time Reinhart realizes the main force was absent it will be too late for him to retaliate.  Then I can bring the full force of our army to bear on Volksburg, without worrying about traitors on our rear.\"Elric leaned back in his chair and looked to Alphons.

Well, the lad was young and had a harsh life Alphons supposed, he couldn't be too harsh on him.

The elderly man nodded, before taking a more comfortable seat to listen to Elric explain the situation, nodding every so often to indicate he was still paying his full attention. It was a good plan that the Elector had and a creative one at that, but Alphons felt it was... somewhat ambitious. \"My Lord, if I may?\" he said after about a minute and a half of thought. \"You shan't crush Volksburg so easily, I believe. However, you have an excellent idea when you go forth to destroy the enemy piece by piece striking the secessionists first. Here is what I propose.\" he stated, removing a small telescopic baton from a recess in his armour and gesturing on the map with it to illustrate his points. \"At Volksburg you need not a token force but one consisting entirely of Engineers. They can raise simulacra of siege engines without wasting resources in the efforts of creating the real thing. They can create fake men and encampments out of wood and canvas and such. Perhaps some retired Witch Hunters in these lands could be enlisted to make sure that this falsehood is deceiving. The enemy will figure it out eventually, but when they realize what has happened they know they have been starved for information and as such hesitate to leave their entrenchments on a hunch buying us even further time. As you said the secessionists must be struck before they reinforce their allies, however.\" At this point Alphons bit his lip slightly. \"I believe we should strike the Paladins. They are an elite force best destroyed before they can mobilize their full might. To know they are crushed will be also an irreversible strike upon the morale of the enemy. My Lord as it stands you will not beat your kin in an open battle. But strike at all the individual elements of his power, cut off all the heads of the hydra and then burn them with fire.
