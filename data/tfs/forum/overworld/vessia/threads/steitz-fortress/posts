Located on a very large outcropping of rock, three sides of the fortress are surrounded by rather deep water. The lake it resides in has a number of rivers attached to it, allowing for the transport of goods to and from the fortress and various other locations by boat. There are two ways into the fortress, the west gate, and the east gate. The east gate is used by the general foot traffic while the west gate is used for the port exclusively. Although not particularly impressive, there is a port on the west side of the fortress. It features a number of docks allowing for ships of various sizes. Cobblestone roads connect this port to both the fortress and the assortment of buildings outside the fortress that make up a \u2018town\u2019 of sorts. Much of the produce brought in is sold in the market right in front of the port, which is generally bustling with both peasants and craftsmen on the lookout for a new type of exotic fruit or trinket. Most leave disappointed and with something more mundane, like a cabbage. A \u2018town\u2019 of sorts has sprung up around the fortress, which possesses a rather large amount of craftsmen. It also features a church, inn, and a bank, although the bank is only open to the craftsman as the peasants lack any meaningful amount of money. Inside the fortress at the base level is all housing and businesses for the most well off craftsmen and some appointed officials. On the next level is where the guardsmen\u00a0live in a barracks of sorts. The third level is essentially there to simply act as a protective buffer between the second level and the fourth level, which is the living quarters for the House of Steitz. This final level is a massive complex of stone, made with craftsmanship from ages past. The complex features a luxurious living area for both its residents and any guest who might be visiting. The most renowned feature of this complex, however, is without a doubt the Steitz Library. One of the largest collection of books in the Vessian Empire, the Steitz Library draws scholars and historians to request permission to look through the books and archives it possesses. Few are given the honor to look through the family's library on request, but those who earn favor with the Steitz are generally permitted access.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/leFUEFR.png"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/leFUEFR.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/>"}, "post-56665": {"user": null, "user_num": null, "timestamp": "1480216292000", "message": "The Berengar Siblings arrived comfortably in the middle of the Lords and Bannermen that were called to the monthly meeting the Archduke of Steitz imposed.

He was not a very good dancer, but that didn't seem to bother him. He was focused on Catalina.\"Who are you?\" He asked.\"Perhaps you should have discovered that before--\" Her words were cut off as they parted again.\"You're of House Berengar, but I don't know your name,\" the Red Bear said again.\"Lady Catalina,\" she answered begrudgingly, and when she turned to dance with another partner, as the dance dictated, she saw the smiling face of the second man that had been about to approach until the Red Bear had horned in first.From where Ruther and the Archduke stood, it seemed that Catalina was more appreciative of this second man than the Red Bear, but this second man was of an even poorer house than Coswold. Still, the man's house was an old one, if not ancient. Other men might have been interested in dancing with Catalina, but they were either intimidated or not interested in being involved with anything to do with the Red Bear and most likely would bide their time.

Finally he cupped his chin with his left hand and began to speak. \"So how are you Archduke? I trust the many businesses are going well?\" he asked, rather conversationally to get a further taste of the man's speech patterns. \"There's some great profiteering to be had in the near future I will say that.\" he added.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0", "link_list": ["/post/57232/thread", "/user/1965", "/post/57226/thread", "/user/1958"], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/GXJlEio.png", "http://i.imgur.com/LaNwJZe.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@isenbardus\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/57232/thread\" timestamp=\"1480649153\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-1965\" title=\"Archduke Isenbardus\"><img alt=\"Archduke Isenbardus Avatar\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/GXJlEio.png\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/57232/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1480649153000\" title=\"Dec 1, 2016 19:25:53 GMT -8\">Dec 1, 2016 19:25:53 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-1965 group-0\" href=\"/user/1965\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@isenbardus\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Archduke Isenbardus</span></a></span> said:</div><div author=\"@emps\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/57226/thread\" timestamp=\"1480646570\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-1958\" title=\"Emperor Rexus Aleksander\"><img alt=\"Emperor Rexus Aleksander Avatar\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/LaNwJZe.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/57226/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1480646570000\" title=\"Dec 1, 2016 18:42:50 GMT -8\">Dec 1, 2016 18:42:50 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-1958 group-0\" href=\"/user/1958\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@emps\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Emperor Rexus Aleksander</span></a></span> said:</div>The Emperor rode to Steitz on a massive white warhorse rather than his usual black coach.

The green stem was fresh and healthy, and five petals blossomed from the center.  The yellow filaments and anthers presented a stark but beautiful contrast against the blue petals, which cascaded from a light blue on the edges to dark blue on the inside.  The Knight-Brother turned to face Cerri and carefully slid the flower in her hair, the color matching her pretty blue eyes.\"I've also been ordered by the Emperor to organize the levies in Swavia, in an effort to defend against the barbarian threat.\"  Adrian unclipped his long, white cloak from both shoulders, swung it around his person and then gently placed it around Cerri to keep her warm; she would need no shawl now.  The cape might have been heavier than a shawl, but it was definitely warm and reliable; it was designed to protect the Brother Knights against the frigid temperatures on their Crusades.Adrian could not help but grin at the beautiful woman before him, but he frowned and looked down at the garden ground.  He lazily scratched the dirt with his steel boot.  \"I must regretfully inform you that I... would not feel comfortable taking you to Swavia.\"  Adrian wasn't sure how safe the region was; the east was dangerous, that much was certain - but the west?  Was it safe?  He looked back up at his love, discreetly reaching over to pluck another flower, which he started to fiddle with behind his back. \"However... you may come along if you so wish... that at least seems to be what the Archduke- er, your brother... half-brother, wants.  Once I confirm the safety of western Swavia, you may remain there.\"Adrian used one hand to motion at the garden, the castle walls, and servants.  \"I'll build you a castle, my Lady, and I shall name it after you.  You will have a garden as beautiful as that of the Stetiz' family.  Anything you need, anything you want, as long as it is within my reach, I will get it for you.  It doesn't matter who you are, or what you do, no one will touch you: peasants, counts, knights, emperors - titles be damned!  You are my Lady, and I am your Knight!\"Adrien knelt down on one knee, and pulled the flower from behind him.  It was tied in the shape of a circle, wide enough so that it may fit over Lady Cerri's finger.
