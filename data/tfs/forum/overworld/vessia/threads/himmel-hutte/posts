As soon as he could make out the noise he jumped to his feet and quickly pulled his clothes back on.  \"Stay here!\" he urged his wife.

He found himself confronted by a convoy of armed men.  Two of them, however, were markedly different.  One was the man from earlier, while the other was a noble.  Adrian could only guess that the traveler had ratted him out.At the sight of the armed man the escort brandished their own weapons.  They outnumbered the former Brother and would not hesitate to subdue him at the Noble's command.  Adrian gripped his sword and gritted his teeth, ready to cut down any fool who dared to step forward and endanger him or his family.\"Stand down!\" the Noble cried.  But he was not speaking to Adrian.  He glared at the men in his cohort and his gaze alone was enough to make them back down.  They lowered their weapons and stepped back a pace.  \"Now...\" the Noble turned his attention to Adrian, then to the traveler, \"take your family and leave this place.  If you have discovered this outlaw then others surely have.  Go on before you find yourself in less hospitable conditions.\"The traveler nodded.  He glanced at Adrian and cast a grimace, but nevertheless headed for the barn to prepare his family.\"As for you,\" the Noble continued, \"Adrian von Heschburg... that is your name, isn't it?  Or are you going by a different moniker these days?\"  The Noble paused, grinning, awaiting the former Brother to answer, but when Adrian offered no response he continued.  \"Your beloved overlord, Konrad von Marschburg, has disbanded the Knights of the Black Cross.  It may interest you to know that your... oath is now forfeit.  At least... in some circles.  You are hereby invited to the rebuilt city of Heschburg, my friend.\"A mixture of emotion washed over Adrian.  Heschburg was his home!  But it had been sacked years ago by the Wickans - one of the reasons he had joined the Brotherhood to begin with.  Had it truly been rebuilt?  He pondered the possibilities and rejoiced at the thought.  This Noble was clearly inviting him to return... but why?  He deduced that if the men were here to capture, or even kill him and his family they would have already done so.Adrian slowly lowered his sword.  \"Finish talking,\" he demanded.The Noble smiled and nodded.  \"Your home has been rebuilt in your absence, my friend.  It will take time to restore Heschburg to its former glory, but it is well on its way to a proper restoration.  All it needs is a... guiding hand...  your guiding hand, Adrian.\"  Then, in reference to Cerri and the children, the Noble added \"as well as a Countess and suitable heirs.\"[/i][/i]", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"You would go crazy,\" he joked, \"dealing with both young'ns all by yourself,\" he finished, laughing.  Adrian kissed his wife once, twice, thrice - four times!  If she consented he would lift her up in his arms and carry her off to a room where young Terra could not see them.  Hansel seemed quite content himself, so Adrian deduced he would not be a bother for the time being.

The Emperor had been killed, and unity was tenuous at best.  The possibility of secession and civil war was not a foregone conclusion.  Should Adrian and Cerridwyn take this opportunity they could very well get dragged into that conflict.  But the former Brother was already making his mind up: he would remain neutral at any cost, if for nothing else then for the sake of his family.Adrian exited the cottage and appeared before the Noble who was tensely awaiting his return.  \"We accept your offer,\" he told the man.The Noble and his men were visibly relieved, as if some great burden had been lifted from their shoulders.  \"Wonderful news!\" the man proclaimed.  \"To be honest, we would not have taken no for an answer,\" he seemed to threaten.  \"There are conditions.\"Adrian rolled his eyes and sighed, \"of course there are.\"\"You will govern the city of Heschburg and its countryside, and your reach shall not extend beyond its borders.
