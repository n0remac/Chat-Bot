Angelo glanced over at the stable to ensure their mounts were still accounted for and, satisfied, led the way.  The Baron's hillfort was really a stone complex that housed himself and his family, with a smithy, barracks, and training yard scattered around it.  A tall palisade surrounded the stronghold and a single gate served to permit entry.\"Halt!\" demanded one of the guards.  Like his associate nearby, he donned a simple helmet and mail, covered by a tabard.  They both carried swords on their belts, but wielded spears while on duty.  \"State your business, peasants,\" he requested harshly.Angelo resisted the urge to tell the man off and replied \"not peasants.

Strangers!\" he began to cry out, \"ye must help-\"\"Quiet you!\" roared a guard, banging his spear against the iron bars.  The fellow must have been Wilton.  He had been stripped of his clothes, and his unkempt hair and unshaven beard implied he had been locked up for more than a few days now.\"Ignore'im,\" Gould ordered, finally bringing them before the stronghold.  He gave three loud raps and before long another guard spied the trio from a peephole.  Another few seconds went by and the door swung ajar.Within was a large hall, furnished with wooden benches, tables, chairs, and rugs.  A nobleman sat in a cushioned chair on the left side of the room, sipping a bottle of wine.  He had a neatly shaven face and his brown hair was pulled backwards into a knot, and his bright blue eyes shone at the proximity of the fire.  Gould returned to his post, while the Baron motioned waved the visitors over to him.\"My man mentioned a couple of strangers who looked your sort,\" he announced.  \"I... am Baron Stratovich, lord of Erlwitz.

HUNGRY!\" he continued to repeat.  Finally he burst into a dirt clearing, where he fell onto his hands and knees.There was an eerie silence; not even the night's wind rustled the leaves in the trees.  Before the trio a collection of bones were scattered throughout.  They were of ox, sheep, cow, and.... man.  \"My daughter!\" cried Wilton, \"I have brought you a sacrifice to fill the Bone Pit!\"  As if called by his voice, something big moved beyond the treeline.  It grunted like an elk, but each footstep was heavy a bear.\"This... might be what we were looking for...\" Angelo commented, drawing his zweihander.And then it came.  Huge bearish paws reached from within the trees and pulled apart the branches, and outstepped some terrible monstrosity.  It's head resembled that an elk, explaining the noises, and it's gnarled antlers were devilishly twisted.  Great black eyes were practically invisible in the night, but they pierced the trespassers.  The body of the creature was like that of a bear: rotund and covered in a thick coat of brown fur.  It's legs were hooved, not unlike a horse, but noticeable large to support it's size.  It easily stood fifteen feet.The chimera inhaled then bellowed a mixture of a roar and elk whine before lumbering towards the trio...", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "A smile slowly crept across Wilton's face.  \"Yes,\" he said softly.  \"Yes... please come with me.
