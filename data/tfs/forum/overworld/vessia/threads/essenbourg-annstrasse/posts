At last, he managed to get her out of the house by offering to let her wear a dress that had come in one of the shipments, one that he had caught her looking at. Never before would Hilda had ever agreed to wearing two skirts, let alone three. Yet in that moment, she could not help but to allow the indulgent feeling with a vengeance, to modeling something that would not yet be seen in the streets of Anntrasse...It was a simple, yet elegant, but not too extravagant floral gown of silver-tissue; beige with varieties of yellow color, and short silk sleeves with lace trim. Hilda had even given in and worn the dreaded, too-stiff, busk corset, but refused to give up the masculine high-heels for the ever-popular silk slippers. They were just not sturdy or enough, and limited her step a bit too much for her liking. Lord Vera's admiration and smart remarks of arranging her marriage had her running out of the estate rather quickly, but not quick enough to keep from hearing his mischievous cackle echo down the hall.\u00a0Hilda was now glad for it.

Well, he admitted it wasn't quite as brazen as what his sister had to deal with but it was nevertheless a problem.But now there was respite. Father had left a key to one of the coffers about and Karol made sure he appropriated it. Saddles filled with gold and as many people as possible bribed to cover for the absence the lad took his sister and they went off for a free roam across the Empire. They remembered fondly when as children they went to the Summer's End Gala in Essenbourg and decide why not once more? Besides, now they could have at the wine and escape parental restraints they could most likely enjoy it even more. They stopped in one of the dynasty's houses in Essenbourg and after an hour of searching to find the key decided to change and then go to Annstrasse's event. Karol had gone for a simple ensemble, red tights that weren't so tight, a collared black jerkin, yellow Landsknecht sleeves all held together with a red fur tabard and belt the most ostentatious thing on him being the messer and hand-crossbow at his belt. Dorika went for something different, a large puffy dress with many stitchings and a large black collar altogether too hot for this environment; perhaps all an indication of a life one was used to having a nurse pick their attire for them.The pair walked along the street, giggling as memories of childhood overwhelmed them and they were momentarily taken to a better time. They both sampled a vine Theodosian wine, the Westerling Bisphoric's grapes providing a unique but pleasurably bitter taste. They took in the music, the floating rose petals, the general satisfaction of men and women in the air. There was a dance, in fact there were many as the street was lined with so many bands that one could get one tune in the left ear and a wholly different one in the right. But the siblings happened upon one where there were some interesting characters indeed. Dorika quickly pointed out two individuals of interest to her, a young curiosity overriding manners as a finger was raised to point out the two people. Karol quickly pushed the offending limb down and tried to be stern and scolding but he couldn't suppress a chuckle. \"They're foreigners, Karli.\"\"Yes Dorika.\"\"Can we met them? Let's go over and talk with them I've only met a few people from outside Egyszerorszag and nobody from outside Vessia!\"\"Me neither. But I think it would be wholly impolite to disturb them in their dancing my dear sister.\" \"Oh. Right.\"The two watched their counterparts from the side, nursing their wine. Between the swarthy redhead and the twirling elf they had caught sight of quite the curiosities.

Although the shift was sudden the way the song melted into the melody of the next was as if two lovers had been apart too long and were coming together again in a sweet and passionate embrace.\u00a0 The crowd semi-parted for a solo dancer, and they all stood there, transfixed by the dance of blades. She began to reminisce about her summer in Essenbourg, and almost didn't want to go back to the Kingdom of Rondon. Too many troubles awaited her back there. But Lord Vera was just about finished with all of his dealings here, and she would have no choice but to go back home with him. It had been nice to get away, if only for a while. Even if it had taken her some time to adjust to being stared at by locals for something as simple as the color of her skin, something that never really happened at home. It had been somewhat of an eye-awakening moment, to know that she would be seen differently here. Hilda didn't even look too much like Lord Vera, and she began to worry that their plan wouldn't work. But her worries were melted away by the strange enchantment of the city and its friendly people. She would have to make sure to return as often as she could.\u00a0As Hilda watched them handle the swords as if they were an extension of themselves, an idea began to creep into her mind. Swinging a sword around all by herself was all well and good, but, aside from getting used to the movements,\u00a0it wasn't really getting her anywhere. Even if she were to visualize an opponent, she had so much more to learn form an actual teacher. But getting caught with a sword, let alone armor, was a bit too risky for Hilda. She feared Lord Vera would lock her up in a tower until he could marry her off properly, and she would rather die than to lose her personal freedom.\u00a0Hilda quickly moved forward when the song ended, her mind on getting to the dancer before all of their other admirers, when she froze mid-stride, face falling from a smile. It was something about the way that he looked, for it was only then that she realized it was a man. But he appeared to elegant, and different, to really just be a man, and it was then that she knew that he was an elf. Lord Vera's deep voice echoed in her mind, the many rules she was to follow under his protection, \"You shall not be seen with an elf\". \"Ever?\" She asked. The House of Silverfire was quite friendly with them. That would be a strange change, indeed. \"Ever,\" he affirmed. And that was that. He was very conscious of their public image and she shouldn't be caught dead doing anything that might batter it, or risk raising suspicion against the household by the Kingdom. Things were uncertain enough as they were. \"Damn,\" she cursed between her teeth, heart beating quickly in her chest as she moved as far away from the musicians as possible. How unfair! Hilda wanted to kick and scream as she would as a child when things did not go her way.\u00a0'What is the matter, my lady?'\u00a0a familiar voice came from behind. She spun on her heel to face her, but there was no one there. 'Ven aqui, mi caracol. No llores, mi vida. Dimelo todo.'\u00a0The voice gave way to a whisper before completely fading, and her heart nearly skipped a beat. Face flushed, Hilda gasped from the breath she hadn't realized she was holding, and held herself against the wall of a building. Luckily, people were not paying attention. She took a moment to breathe slowly, or else risk having a complete, too-public meltdown. It always did have the worst timing. She heard the man armored from head to toe before she saw him walk up, and felt relieved to recognize their crest on the breastplate. \"My lady?\" the concern in his voice was clear. By that time, she had the panic under control. \"It is nothing,\" she tried to sound re-assuring, even as her voice slightly broke. \"The dance merely took my breath away, is all!\"\"I thought I saw smoke,\" the voice came from within the helmet. \"The heat must be getting to you,\" she waved a dismissive hand before ushering him away. \"It is getting to me, a bit. I will admit. Let's get back to the festival!\"\u00a0Not a minute later, Hilda was at a food stand, stuffing her face with samples.

Perhaps she thought he was being obnoxious to the curiosities, but Karolai just thought she didn't get out of the castle enough.\u00a0</div>"}, "post-93513": {"user": "Hilda Vera de Rond\u00f3n", "user_num": 3571, "timestamp": "1572141418000", "message": "\"Ohohohoho!

Something to do with the warmth in those eyes as she held them. \"Oh, my stars,\" she smiled in Dorika's direction before turning to Alverein, then back to Karolai. \"A small world, indeed! I won't deny that your horses are a fine specimens, but I must agree with Lady Dorika. You must have learned from my father by now, as I have no doubt in my mind that he goes on and on about how my peoples take immense pride in our Rondi Thoroughbreds. Nuestra Pura Raza! Of course, there is only one way to truly find this out.\" Hilda smiled through slightly pursed lips as she subtly referred to the horse races that often took place between merchant lords and tradesmen, a popular sport among their people created for situations such as these.

The response he got only confused him further, and in attempt to once more get him quiet his sister whispered to him: \"very good, sir.\" as clarification. The pair then turned their attentions to the exchange between the other two, Dorika giggling at the mention of her family's equestrian tradition. It seemed that language, culture and seas might separate people and yet really they will be ever the same. This part at least got to Karolai as well and even he couldn't help but smile faintly at Vera's words.\"Oh none was taken. It's just friendly advice, I don't think anyone in present company would be so prideful as to be hurt by words. But some people... well, they're a little more humourless.\" Dorika explained, glancing over at a few nobles she recognized in the scenery. Yes, they most certainly would fit the descriptor of \"a little more humourless\". Alverein turned to Hilda and inquired to her about matters more important than chit-chat, to which the siblings had a difference of opinion. Karolai knew it was better not to pester people, but Dorika having so rarely left the familial castle was upset at having one of her few true experiences cut so abruptly and pleaded to her brother to do something. Alas, he would not. \"Well, thank you for your time!\" he said, bowing and after a flick to the forehead getting his sister to curtsy. \"I hope you enjoy your stay here, the place isn't at its best but there's always wonder in it if you care to look.\" With that and a few pulls on the arm of his sister they went off to look elsewhere for something to happen.
