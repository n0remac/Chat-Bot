It serves as the crossroads of trade from the other provinces, and funnels trade out to them, making it a source of capital for those in control. The main architecture of the city is wattle and daub for homes and businesses. The northern district leads to the Cathedral of Nahum, a towering structure dedicated to the patron saint of the Duchy, the warrior prophet Nahum that created the first fort in the Duchy's borders. It is currently under the control of Johann IV.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/pXVPDZH.jpg"], "html": "<div align=\"center\"></div>"}}
