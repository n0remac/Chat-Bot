All was still, and for Enigma, filled with nothing but the throbbing pain in his limbs.Then, all at once, there was an explosion of light. They were in a glowing tunnel, all the walls smoother than marble. As they traveled through this tunnel, the glowing dimmed, and they stopped just before it turned black completely. A smile twitched to the woman's face.\"Ah, I see what's happening here,\" she said warmly. If the young man had any feeling in his hands, he would notice a strange feeling, similar to a leech suctioning onto his skin. \"This certainly won't heal on its own. It's a good thing I caught you at this stage. Regrowing limbs is much harder than repairing them.\"The silence of the room broke, and an enormous, deafening rush, like standing under a waterfall, filled their ears.

It isn't enough to make it live. It would be nice to have feeling again, yes?\"A groaning, like strained lumber, was the next noise to queue. Jutting just beyond the walls was a bright thicket of branches that stretched out so much it blinded them. The healer shifted their focus, suddenly, traveling through a maze of tunnels at a nausea-inducing speed. They passed impossible numbers of those flickering lights and glowing branches, some slightly different shapes to the others. There was a low, rhythmic thumping in the background, slow, but ever-present.They stopped once they reached another room- this one filled with a lightning storm bouncing from globulous ropes. Yuzana inclined her head slightly. \"You're in so much pain, yet you do not scream. Well, I can fix one of those.\"The room was suddenly filled with smoke, circling them. The young man would feel a wave of relief spill over him, urging him to relax. It was then that the woman let go, peeling her hands from his. Some of his dead skin stuck to her palms, revealing the bright pink of skin that was still trying to repair itself from damage.The elf beamed. \"It will take some time to heal completely, but your body knows what to do now.

This certainly won't heal on its own. It's a good thing I caught you at this stage. Regrowing limbs is much harder than repairing them.Enigma didn't seem to feel the leeching sensation\u00a0on his skin, and would just sit in silence, focusing on the lights and the pain. A few moments later he was met with a new phenomenon as sound was introduced into the equation. His muscles tensed slightly as the sound hit him and the lights rushed past him initially but he relaxed once again just as quickly.This isn't the only thing we'll need. It isn't enough to make it live. It would be nice to have feeling again, yes?Enigma simply nodded, too enamored by the tunnel of lights. Even sitting still there his body felt tricked in a way, as if he was actually flying through the tunnel of lights physically for a few moments. Then, before Enigma could process what had happened he was flung into another flight through a maze of lights at a speed that made his head spin. He could feel deep within his being a rhythmic\u00a0thumping as well as if the beat of his heart could suddenly be felt all over his body, though it wasn't unpleasant like the throbbing pain of his limbs.Then, he was met with a room filled with lightning. He could hear the woman speaking but he didn't really process what she said, forgetting the words as quickly as she spoke them. He was much more focused on the globes of lightning in long ropes, and the rythmic\u00a0thumping he felt.\u00a0Thus, the relief he felt when she began to erase his pain was increased two-fold as he didn't expect it. It felt much like a cool mist to him, washing over his body and erasing the pains and aches that had throbbed across his body for what seemed like ages, leaving only the euphoric feeling of relief and that constant calming rhythmic thumping.\u00a0Suddenly, Enigma could feel the feeling fading, as he realized the women no longer held his hand.
