For an experienced traveller, however, it's a challenge few would say no to. The long, winding roads through the snow-covered mountains had taken days to navigate, and for a novice it would take even longer since most have a tendency to get lost. However, getting lost for a certain Av\u2019 just doesn\u2019t happen, and if it does? Well that\u2019s just part of a longer adventure, but the destination is almost always the same. On the last leg of the long and winding road sits a small cart hooked up to a daydreaming donkey, just off the main road and out of the way and at the foot of a winding path that cuts through the rocky formations that surround this part of the road. The donkey itself idly chews on a carrot that sticks out of the snow, so the owner couldn\u2019t be too far, and considering the condition of the cart and the bright red, blue, and green blanket that covers the donkey, the owner isn\u2019t a stranger to this kind of path. The wind that had blasted the mountains these past few days had almost completely subsided, bringing a serenity to the valley, leaving the air free of noise, other than the odd rock falling loose and echoing against the surrounding mountain sides as it clatters to the bottom of the valley. The silence is peaceful, at least. Through the small winding path, one would find an opening to a small outlook, bathed in sunlight, that looks out over the vast western side of Toragana, its location passed around by experienced travellers and known for the beautiful view. In the sunlight that beams through the clouds on high is a woman, Av\u2019rae no doubt. The woman stands facing the opening, but on one bowed leg, her strange Av\u2019 boot pressed into the snow. The other leg is lifted, with the sole of the boot against her knee. One arm is pulled in just under her chest with her palm facing up, while the other is held just in front of her face, with her index and middle fingers pointed up towards the sky, parallel to her nose. She mostly wears what you would expect of a traveller; good quality boots, loose but comfy pants, armored with a light, platemail skirt, split down the middle for mobility. Her form is mostly wrapped in a deep blue poncho, adorned with golden stitching in various, intricate Av\u2019 designs that loop and swirl around themselves, and dancing along the darker blue trim. However, through the folds, one may notice a leather corset strapped around a somewhat loose chainmail vest. Her face is in deep focus, eyes closed and brows relaxed. She\u2019s rather pretty, actually, from what anyone could tell with her hand in the way. Her skin is light purple and her hair an almost black, at least the parts that could be seen under her hood. Various pieces of gold would distract the eye, however, most notably two small rings that pierce her right side bottom lip, and one through her septum that connects into the hood, probably her left ear, with a golden chain. Her horns slip through cuts in  the hood and roll backwards before pointing ahead once again, not unlike a ram, that end in golden caps. To an Av\u2019 they would be fairly average, but to the layman they would likely be quite impressive. Perhaps most notably, are the bright, light blue lines that glow brilliantly across her face. The bright tattoos swirl around each other, not too unlike the designs on her poncho, and pulse ever so slightly with each breath. The reason may become clear with the sight of a small light suspended just above her index finger, fed by a steady, sustained arc of lightning that emanates from her finger tip, occasionally sparking off silent arcs that go towards her jewelry, but it doesn\u2019t seem to bother her. Finally, she is far from unarmed, at her hip sits an ornate dagger, its blade curved in its sheath and its pommel adorned by a ruby, surrounded by gold, and within arms reach, sticking from the snow, sits a Bardiche, a bladed pole weapon, with its axe-like blade curving up and over the end of the pole to create a stabbing point. If this woman is able to use this weapon with any efficiency, it would be unwise to cross her. Regardless, she seems cut off from the world, with the sun to her back and the winding path in front of her. What is she doing though? Meditating? Praying? The Av\u2019 can be mysterious, so much so that some would actually consider it some kind of power nap. The donkey continues to chomp on his carrot without a care to what\u2019s going on around him.

She could see the end of the trail now, not far ahead. \"A forest far to the west\u2026 or was it south? I can't remember. Mischievous tree spirits, playing tricks on travellers. When I discovered this, I could not help but find the fun in it. Wouldn't you do such s thing if you could?\" She asks, looking to her elven companion. Her horns tugged at the material of her hood as she turns, and causes the hanging jewellery from them to jingle softly. \"But the child monk perhaps would not see the amusement in such things,\" she continues as her eyes go back to the road. \"I have heard of him, but not met him. Or perhaps I have and forgotten, he would not be the first.\" Her ears are given to her companion as she speaks, not intending to interrupt as the conversation gets deep. There's a silence in the air as she processes the story, mulling it over in her mind. More death and destruction, a tale she has heard time and time before, far too often really. There's always someone out there wanting to make life misery for others. \"Is he dead?\" She asks, finally. \"Is his head on a pike? His skull among those of his men? It should be.\" Her voice is low, hatred seeping into it. She lets out a small breath and puts a hand on Manisha's shoulder. \"One foot before the other, my friend. If it is revenge you seek, it is revenge you will find.\" There's a small squeeze before she lets go. \"Your past is not unlike that of my people's, but it was the land itself that destroyed our home. Revenge is\u2026 going to be much harder for us, but there is a satisfaction in seeing our friends get what they deserve. Especially if it leads to a home.\"  ", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The Av' huffs with amusement briefly. \"Perhaps if he could actually speak.\" Even if he may be bad at conversation, she had a love for her donkey that one would have for an old friend, more than just a relationship of convenience or a pet.

It was so sour; she didn't understand how one could eat such a thing!Continuing the topic of her home, she nodded. \"I cannot seek revenge. Years and years ago, he perished. Another Khan took his throne. After that, it was all about finding a home. Now that Khan is dead and a murderer has taken his place. I fear the destruction of my new home. I can only imagine it was him who sent the assassin weeks ago, but I haven't got any proof.\" She put a hand atop Shyv'Ahna's and smiled. \"The sentiment is appreciated, but there is no revenge here.

The oceans reclaimed our coasts and took with it whatever remained of our cities. Few survived and were forced to scatter.\u201d She gives a small sigh and shakes her head. \u201cWe still search for home, but where to find it depends on the Av\u2019. Many just look for new lands, but there are some who wish to reclaim what remains of our old cities. To find our relics, and the Grand Library, but where these places are is lost to time.\u201d She looks to Manisha and smiles. \u201cBut we have nothing but time now, no?
