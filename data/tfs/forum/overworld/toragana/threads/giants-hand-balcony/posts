So, thousands upon thousands will leave and cross to here. Whole towns and villages emptied and moved over to a new place. I am here because I want to make sure the movement is as smooth as possible.\" Of course, now he had to clarify why the migration might not be smooth. \"The people of Audria will not adapt to a nomadic lifestyle. It is as simple as that. When I sailed here I noted a small natural habour to the far East that was devoid of settlement, and I believe it is there that their first settlement will be. It was far enough from other peoples to avoid direct conflict. But that initial settlement will last them maybe a year before already they want more space, before they already reverse their demographic trends with eight child families. They will spread in all directions, they will burn the grasslands that the prey of nomad people eat and build aqueducts before ploughing up the land and farming it. Unfortunately they cannot conceive that anyone would even consider living differently, and slowly but surely they will turn their surroundings into an image of what they lost. But that is not even where the issues will begin, Saso. They will not yield to any authority but themselves, and from what I have already heard of some Khan fellow that is already a reason for bloodshed. Beyond that they will on the harbour build a port which may well attract a kind of people that on the mainland are known as adventurers who many may consider an unwelcome arrival and may easily blame the port that brought them in for their arrival.\"Well, it seemed he did a decent job, didn't he? \"Now, here is perhaps where I need your help. My cartographic reference of the land is outdated and more or less useless, almost as empty as my knowledge of the land. I need to know what lands near that harbour are unsettled and ungrazed so that they may be the next settlements to at least delay conflict, I need insight of the region's geopolitics to understand how to prevent yet another war that will end only in the annihilation of one or another side.\" ", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<div align=\"justify\">Nestor followed Sarita mostly keeping quiet as they walked, thinking of how to frame what he was going to say.
