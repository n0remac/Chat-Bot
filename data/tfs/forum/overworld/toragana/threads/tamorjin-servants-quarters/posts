She moved through the vast halls of the palace like a ghost, her footfalls soft, pink dress billowing around her like whisps. Her skin reflected like pearls, glowy and pale, while her plump lips showed starkly against it with a vibrant rouge. Her hair was pulled up in intricate braids stuck in place with long pins.Usually, a servant never dressed so elegantly, but Yaling had an unspoken title above that of a typical noble's slave. When she asked something of another slave, they would not hesitate to do it. If they tried, punishments were delivered. Whispers floated out through the court about how she shared the Khan's bed and kept him wound around her finger, but no such rumors were ever confirmed. One thing was in agreement with all the slaves, however:Yaling was a spoilt, uncompromising cur, and absolutely no one loved her.When she came to retrieve Kalina, she did so with nary a call. She lifted a hand to point to the young spider-kin and then beckoned her to follow. If she did not, she was dragged.They traveled through the halls and into the servant's quarter, slightly less luxurious than what Kalina was used to but by no means gritty or unclean. The Hamjilga took her to the courtyard, where a large pole stuck to one of the buildings. A length of silk hung from it. Sitting atop this pole was a young lady wearing scraps, hair tossed about her shoulders in an oily, filthy mess, skin smeared with soot that didn't manage to hide the purple bruises. She was snarling, wild, madness swirling in her eyes as several other servants tried to get her down from her perch.Yaling pointed to her.\"You will be making clothes for the new entertainer. She will be performing for the khan, so make sure you outfit her appropriately. Make the wild dog look like a lady, and later, I will make her act\u00a0like one.\"Without further ado, Yaling skimmed the ground until she found a palm-sized rock. Her sharp eyes locked onto the wild woman on the pole, and with a decent wind-up, she tossed the rock.It hit the girl square in the ribs, shaking her grip until she fell to the ground. One servant, a son of Tamorbataar, caught her in his large hands as she cried out.Yaling smiled.\"There you are. The slave will not be moving too much after that. You can do the measurements now.\"Turning curtly, she left, not a sound following her.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Not long after the princess' departure, which was unknown to the khan until several of her maids reported her absence and the letter to explain it, one of the Hamjilga came to round up her servants and distribute them."}, "post-92888": {"user": "silkofkali", "user_num": 3534, "timestamp": "1565012391000", "message": "Kalina was a quiet servant, always a diligent worker in what she considered a passion and hobby.

Streaks of pink not only ran through the hairs on her carapace, but also through her real hair.At the time Yaling had emerged into the Princess's chambers, the spider-kin was working the loom. The silk threads she had weaved herself and dyed were being strung into cloth. It was too early to tell if it would be a tapestry or simply another garment for her mistress and friend. Kalina had to do a double take at the elegantly dressed servant and had been initially confused as to what the woman wanted. Taking too long, she was dragged along with a gasp, her arachnid legs trying to cling to the polished stone floor without success. Her voice was too caught in her own throat to really protest this sudden and rude displacement. Was she being moved permanently? Sold? Did something happen to the princess?While panic-inducing thoughts raced in her young mind, she was relieved when Yaling explained it was just to make a new outfit for... a... the sight was so unfamiliar she didn't know what exactly he was looking at. A woman, but.. also an animal. Except the animals she had seen around looked better and were better behaved. She gave a bewildered stare as Yaling left and then back at the wild woman. This was... different. Swallowing her own discomfort, she grabbed a measuring string and approached carefully in order to start taking measurements.She hoped they didn't bite.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Kalina was a quiet servant, always a diligent worker in what she considered a passion and hobby.
