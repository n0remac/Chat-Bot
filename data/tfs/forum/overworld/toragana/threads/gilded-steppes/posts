For Tam, he'd always read it as the ladder, but currently his ice blue eyes read the country before him.He knew not where he was going--- and that suited him well his feet had carried him over the waves- to the land of rice and teas...Fond memories were made there. Brotherly bonds formed, and sweet nothings whispered over blossom tea and charcoal etchings.Fresh Tah'nish--- the Tattoo like scars covering this tall, bronzed man's body, were etched onto his left arm. Though one marking did not seem to flow with the rest of the markings,--- they were Tawakoshian runes which read Chen-Hua, A tattoo rather than a Tal'nish, in red ink to remind him of the way she made him blush over tea. Swaying with the wind, his loose-fitting creme garb clapping time, the Bronzed man began to sing in As'deen--- a humble melody made rich and sweet by his deep tones.
