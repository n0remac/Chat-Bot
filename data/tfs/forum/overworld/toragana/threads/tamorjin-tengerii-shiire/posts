It was hard to believe that he had wrought such destruction with his own two hands, leading a small group of men to secure the peaceful valley. Though it was not his first kill, it was his first raid. He never heard the screams of children and saw the frailness of age on the battlefield, which made this experience so much more different. He wondered how his fathered managed. Perhaps it was just something to get used to. Steeling himself, the young pillager followed his men to the center of the village, where prisoners were being held. Most of them were women, a few others men who had surrendered themselves when their allies fell. Some were children... but so few, so few.The young man knelt in front of one of the prisoners- a young woman who was no older than himself- and furrowed his brow. Her eyes were aimed at the dirt, figure slumped, hands tied behind her back. He pressed a hand against her forehead, forcing him to look at her.\"What is your name?\" he demanded, though his voice was far too soft for a warrior. When the girl's brown eyes locked onto him, she found herself surprised. In front of her stood a man adorned in fine furs and jewels, his face young and handsome. He was nothing like the monsters surrounding him, who were towering and ugly, faces twisted by rage and scarred from past battles. Even so, she was not betrayed by his pretty face. If he was with them, he was also a monster.She spat in his face.Not a moment later, a boot met hers. The girl smashed into the mud, face pressed into the water. As she struggled to breathe, the young man raised a hand and pushed away the assailant. \"Leave her. Leave her!\" he hissed. His orders were obeyed without question, allowing him to reach down and pick the girl up. She spluttered and coughed, heaving mud out of her throat. The conqueror sighed.\"Clean her up. Feed her.

It had been a successful hunt- that much was apparent by the heavy sled that scraped along behind the yak that she lay on comfortably. Three clean kills with three arrows had been her contribution to the hunt, much to her companion's chagrin as they fumbled with their bows ultimately scaring off their prey on more than one occasion. She didn't mind though, she lived for the hunt and to provide for her village and that was all that mattered. Her bow lay across her stomach comfortably, notched just in case any passing vulture got any ideas about picking at their prizes. They had long ago learned not to mess about with the hunting party so long as Chinua was around, though. The thought made the smile on her face grow wider as she settled in more comfortably on the yak, the traveling song lulling her into a daze... that was until, the song began to fade slowly. Her right eye opened a crack, looking over at the man to her right, her brow cocked. He was staring at something ahead of them.\u00a0\"...Hey... Where is all that smoke from?\" Came another voice to her side- it was her younger brother, Bataar, who had accompanied her on his first hunt. He finally broke the silence that had settled over the group. A cold hand of dread wrapped around her heart as she heard him and her eyes instantly shot open as she  sat up and turned, prompting the yak below her to amble to stop as the rest of the party did.It was hard to tell but just barely if one had eyes sharp enough, one could still see a dense plume of smoke rising up to the sky from where she knew their village to rest. None of their campfires were ever so strong to send up a cloud that large of smoke. Silence settled over the group as they all stopped to stare at the smoke cloud. That was until Chinua\u00a0 couldn't take it anymore and burst into motion. She sprung from her seat on the yak, grabbing her quiver of arrows and strapping it on as she let out a sharp whistle as she started off at a sprint. Her horse responded immediately, bucking off her brother who she had let ride for the journey back, following after her. \"Ooof!\" Bataar cried out as he hit the ground suddenly only to roll over his eyes wide as he watched his sister mount her horse still sprinting. \"Chinua?! Where are you-!\" \"I'm going ahead to the village! You and the others- go to the next village and wait until I send for you! Jochi, Gerel, follow behind me at half pace!\" She called back to them. The party was made up entirely of young men- they barely counted as such they were so young. She wouldn't allow anything to happen to them, nothing more than what could have already happened. She didn't let that consume her though as she spurred her horse onwards, ignoring the shouts from behind her, calling for her to return. She merely leaned lower to drive her faster towards their home. She just prayed she wasn't so late, even rushing would do them no good.By the time Chinua reached the hidden pass up to the village, the sun had already begun to set. Her horse was panting from the exertion, but the loyal beast held up till they made it to the entrance. Chinua steered her stead towards where she knew a water hole was hidden, the run off from the top of the plateau dripping into the basin at the bottom. She quickly brought her to the water and dismounted nudging her forward to drink, but as her horse dipped down to take a sip, she suddenly whinnied and bucked back, pulling and refusing. Chinua's eyes widened in confusion as she tried to calm her.\u00a0\"What's wrong with you? It's just-\"\u00a0 The words died in her throat as she turned to take a closer look at the water. Or more aptly, what was floating there. A man, face down, bloated and floating in the pool she and her brother had played in as children till their mother scolded them and told them to get away from the entrance. His blood stained the once crystal clear water, a deep red. But the water was far too red to have only been polluted by his blood.\u00a0Chinua didn't try to fish his body from the water. She didn't try to think too hard about who the body could've belonged to. She didn't even try to calm her horse as a blind rage overtook her and she took her bow from her back and turned with a deadly precision and sprinted fleetly up the mountain pass, ignoring all that stood in her way. Her blood ran cold as she passed more unidentified bodies of men on the pass, but her steps never falter as her grip tightened on her bow as she reached the crest of the plateau and saw...Nothing. Nothing but ash, blood and death. And... the demons that caused it.\u00a0She watched in abject horror as a creature\u00a0impaled the still body woman who had always snuck her treats from childhood onto a fixed spear to join the others that already had been placed. Her blood that had chilled suddenly burned hotter than she could have ever thought possible as with practiced ease, she drew an arrow, notched it and pulled back her bow string. Even through bleary eyes, her aim was as true as always and never faltered as she took her first shot. The man closest to her turned hearing the twang of her bow, just in time for the arrow to sink into its home, straight through his right eye, sinking into his brain, killing him instantly.\u00a0Chinua had never killed a man, had never had any desire to but the weight of action hardly fazed her as she turned from the man who crumpled to the ground, taking aim at another who whipped around at the sound of a body falling. Another arrow flew and another body hit the ground. She didn't even stop to process how outnumbered she was- how even with her aim, she didn't have enough arrows in her quiver to take them all down. She just turned, set her aim and released.\u00a0Distantly she could hear someone screaming, and it wasn't until the third body hit the ground did she realize it was her.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Chinua had a content smile on her face as her eyes sat lazily half shut, listening idly to her companions guttural cheery voices as they finished the last leg of their return journey back home to their village.

Bataar had slipped away from the hunting party the moment they had arrived in their sister village. As if he could turn tail and hide when his sister ran off on her own to investigate their home. And the dread that settled in his gut wouldn't let him rest easy. So he stole a horse and sped off at the first opportunity back to his home.If only the sight that had greeted him was his sister scowling as she cuffed him over the ear for ignoring her orders. And their village chuckling at their antics as they began wrestling in the mud, only to get tossing in the lake later by their irritated mother. A warm bowl of porridge waiting for them in their hut after they had cleaned up and sulked back home. But no. All he saw were the bodies, the blood and the ash left behind. He had stood staring at the remains of his life till he no longer could and instead ambled forward trembling as he looked for... anything. Anyone still alive. ...He found his mother and father amongst the bodies impaled upon the pikes, mouths and eyes open in horror at their passing. The scream that loosed from him sent even the buzzards up in an uproar. But as he went he noticed no sign of Chinua anywhere. A few were missing from the ranks of the village as well as Bataar scoured the plateau, collecting bodies slowly, his body feeling numb but for the faint hope that began to form. That only grew when he stepped accidentally on one of Chinua's arrows. She had made it back. And she had fought. But if she and the others weren't among the dead, then perhaps... they had escaped. Or been taken alive by those who had done this. He only had to find them and kill the bastards who had caused it. He'd found some imprints in the mud far larger than could have been made of those of the village as well as a helm which a foreign crest upon it.  He'd find them. And he'd find his sister and village. And together they'd get revenge. But for no the matter of burying and laying to rest those corpses took priority. So he labored slowly, digging graves for the fallen  in the ashes of the village. He had taken a short break to drink and eat some hard tack- despite his lack of appetite he knew he had to eat something- when he heard voices. He froze and immediately crouched down into the  grave he'd been digging and peeked over the lip , searching till he laid eyes on two forms wandering through the ruins. He frowned as he watched slowly. They hadn't seemed to have noticed him yet. He crept out of the grave slowly using some of the splintered supports to hide behind as he inched forward silently. His eyes narrowed as he took them in. One was large and formidable, the other.... rather small... almost feminine in comparison. But the larger one... certainly large enough to be one of those that had made the imprints in the mud. They had returned? But why? The answer didn't truly interest him though. As he realized it was them, it set his blood alight and he scowled as he silently pulled his sword and made his way forward, matching his steps to theirs to disguise his presence. Though outnumbered, he had the element of surprise on his side. Hushing his breath for a moment  when he got close enough  he braced himself before he shot forward from the ruins of a hut to the smaller of the two, hoping to use the smaller as a hostage to get information from. His hand shot out hoping to grasp the woman? by the hair and drag her back to hold against him with his sword poised to slit her throat.

She'd seen her fair share of Stanitsas raided by all manner of bloody bandit that stalked the steppe in roving droves of horse and bow. What Tengerii served as now was a waypoint, a stop on the map, between point A and point B. It was a solid resting spot, the village that used to lie there had been set up in an ideal area, and the ruins provided extra cover, both from potential enemies and the elements. It was the ideal campsite for a set of travelers making their way through the recesses of Toragana. Her trade caravan made frequent use of it, and it wasn't uncommon to find other free men camped out amongst the rubble. What they would find waiting this trip however, would be something truly bizarre.The caravan came to a steady slow as they approached what was once the settlement's main road. The Hetamanate always stood out, even with those native to Toragana. Three carts, and about 12 of them in total, including Viktoriya herself. They wore unusual garb, the mounted men dressed in their chokhas, red, white, black, adorned with accents of silver and gold, simple cotton pants and knee high leather boots. Most sported tall fluffy hats, papakha, made of white or black sheep's wool. Some men among the carts sported fur cloaks and coats and simple drawstring shirts, some with bandannas, while others had their heads left bare, slick black hair styled in the unusual chupryna cut, a single lock snaking down the side of a cleanly shaven head. Most sported finely waxed or styled mustaches, mutton chops, or full on beards. The one other woman accompanying the band besides Viktoriya wore a simple red and white sarafan dress. The soldiers wore sabres at their waists, and the forward vanguard tightly clutched fur adorned lances. The few men in the rear guard sported simple bows, the most commonly seen weapon among the people of the steppe. At the center of it all, the merchant matriarch herself, Viktoriya Perekupnik, in a style atypical and seemingly unfitting for the woman. On stretches of long travel she usually opted for more comfortable travelling gear, and so she too wore a chokha, a woolly white papakha crowning her head, matching perfectly with the white fox fur shawl that rested gently on her broad shoulders, a sabre hung from either hip. Their horses were comparably furtive to the ring of massive steeds that lay ahead. As their forward patrol made the signal to stop, Viktoriya let a grumble and sigh escape her lips, unimpressed to stumble across an interruption in their plan. Viktoriya ordered the wagons and their rear guard to remain at the entrance to the village ruins, not only would they cover their flank for an impending ambush, but Viktoriya didn't want to risk her untrained personnel, or worse yet, their cargo, moving up to address their unexpected camp neighbors. Viktoriya, her translator and foreign agent, and two veteran cavalrymen would approach with her instead. They had no intentions to fight, such a small group probably wasn't any military force or raiding band. They approached slowly on horseback, torches lit, trot slow, weapons sheathed but ready to draw. As they encroached on the small encampment the merchantess raised a quizzical brow, their horses coming to a halt as the soft glow of the torches illuminated the edge of the ring of camping soldiers. Her right most cavalier, Yakiv, said what she was thinking in a half whisper, they spoke in their native tongue.\"Foreigners? This far from the Isranian port and Giant's hand?\" he hissed.The one on the far left, Mykola, was next to chime in. \"Maybe they're Isranian? Mercenaries hunting down a thief or something? God knows we have no shortage of those up here.\"\"Do they look Isranian to you, mudak? We never saw shit like this at Silverion. It's like they're made of metal. Where the hell did they come from?\" she snapped back, Yakiv snickering as his friend was cursed out by their leader. Viktoriya shot him a silencing glare. Finally, the voice of reason chimed in: Vadym, her wordly translator.\"Pretty sure they're Vessians.\" he remarked, in a matter of fact tone.\"You speak their language, Vadym? I have no great desire to fight a thing like that, even with superior numbers.\" Viktoriya asked.\"Bah, we could take 'em.\" Mykola scoffed, quickly hushed by another dagger glare from their venomous leader.\"A little, that's what you pay me for, after all. I'm pretty sure they speak the common tongue though.\" He remarked.She let a little musing hum slip through her lips, before meeting eyes with the stoic translator and giving a nod. With that, he bellowed out a greeting, cupping a hand over his mouth as he called out to the watchman on guard, a simplistic but accurate Vessich \"Hello, we mean no harm!\" The four awaited a response with choked breaths, fingers twitching as they readied themselves should the foreigners answer with weapons rather than words.

He gave a tap to each of his comrades so they would wake, each rising to look at the Free Men through their visors. They could in theory kill them, the distance wasn't too grand and the enemy didn't seem particularly heavily armed. None amongst them seemed to bear plate armours, nor did they seem to bear any maces or other tools to crack open the cans that the Knights were. On the other hand, the woman there amongst them may well have been a wizard and these nomad folks were clever, they could easily be hiding a mace or a firepot about their person. Anyway, they didn't seem to be Tamorjin, Centaurs, elves, or other peoples they could classify as under-humans. In fact, they looked quite similar to some minorities of Swavia, they certainly didn't look like the darker skinned and slant or squint eyed folks that they had come to stereotype as Toragana natives. A quick vote was taken, and it was ultimately decided they'd parley with their counterparts who seemed to want to do likewise. They were oddly surprised to be addressed in their home tongue, and looked to one another looking for an answer. As the de facto leader of the group, Lazar articulated a reply first. \"Yes.\" Technically not a lie, two of the men were ethnic Vessischers and one was of a Vessian minority, even if only one of them was actually born in Vessia. \"We are, I suppose there are things to distinguish us.\" He said, before looking to the rest of the group and addressing them in the common tongue, knowing a conversation that was only understood by one person of the Knight's counterparts would most likely make the rest of the Free Men unnerved and anxious. \"We're, er... traders, we got lost.\" He said, realizing how daft the reply was. Traders from Vessia usually never crossed the mountains this far, and when they did they would take a comfortable and safe route straight to the Giant's hand. Vessians that got this far into Toragana were usually the Questing Knights that crossed the mountains every other year looking to prove themselves in an alien land, albeit they would never carry the same black-white heraldry as the Order nor would they have the same distinctive horns on their helmets. But to people who only saw Knights every so often, how was one tin man different from another? \"Well, rather there were some traders who got lost, now we search for them.\" Lazar said, now much more confident with a more believable story. \"We don't look kindly upon some of our folk disappearing.\" ", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<div>The Knights slept fairly well, shifts of the men guarding going between Brothers Lazar, Cyrus, Kuno, Sigmund and Bolko.

They began to dismount from the horses, Vadym aiding Viktoriya in making it safely to the ground in a graceful manner.

Toragana is practically brimming with bandits, raiders, and thieves. It would be one hell of a hassle to figure out who killed them, if they really are dead. If it's the Tamorjin, forget about it. They are like...locusts.

They would fit in just fine in Toragana. She shifted her weight to the other foot as he continued filling her in with the details of their supposed quest. \"Is that so? If they camped here that means they were either headed for Vil'nih or the stanitsas, though as I said I believe it unlikely, so far as I'm informed, and I am always informed. The other option would be they were headed out of the mountains, that would likely mean either Dzhambul or Giant's Hand.\" she offered, trying to provide them some help in narrowing their search, if they were truly searching for anything at all. The man introduced himself then, but stared at her hand without shaking. Creases formed at the edge of the woman's welcoming smile as she fought the urge to sneer at him for refusing to shake her hand. \"It is good to meet you, Lazar.\" she forced out in her best cordial tone, in spite of her annoyance with his earlier slight.

But if I think I understand what you're trying to get at, we're Free Men, of the Hetamanate.

To start I'll give you what I can agree to. For an estimate, I could easily muster one hundred to two hundred riders for the excursion, depending on what you think is necessary, I have little information on the population we're going up against so you'd have to fill me on more reasonable expectations.

Her face would then harden, not with anger, but certainly with steely resolve.\"Where my problem begins is the idea of us collecting upon arrival. I personally have no real qualms with this, though you're an unfamiliar foreign organization so tracking you down if you decided to skip out would beg of me to ask for a retainer. However, I could see myself overlooking this as a kindness. The real issue in the men in question. I guarantee you no rider worth his sword would agree to ride all the way to the southern reaches without a portion of forward pay. This means you can either provide working capital for me now for hiring, or I can assume the risk of initial stipends myself. If you're asking me to assume the risk I would expect a substantial increase to my final pay out for putting my own investments on the line on your behalf, or a clause in writing to assure I would be paid back for anything I lost on wage thieves.\" she said flatly, her gaze unflinching from Lazar as she laid out the aspects she'd like to see renegotiated.\"As for future ventures, your suggestion seems more than fair to me, and honestly, bounty pay outs are something Free Men often find quite agreeable, so I have no doubt a good number of the warriors might stay to collect on that, so your additional costs there would be quite low if they prove necessary.

Furthermore from what we know of their arsenal that their arms and armour aren't up to par for professional soldiers, and there isn't enough to go around for all of them. They will also be weary, underfed, and sickly from having so long travelled to escape the North sleeping perhaps an hour daily and all under open skies. Furthermore, they shall be disorganized, and most likely not prepared for pursuit so far south and as such disorganized; if the mercenaries perform well enough they should be able to pick off small unprepared bands of a hundred or so of the foe easily avoiding any losses whatsoever. These men should naturally have seeds so as to catch up to these hooved creatures and it would be best if they had bows, slings or javelin to pick off those that may try to run, while lance and blade would be excellent for the first charge; as previously remarked they have little of their crude arms and armour so more specialized weapons like maces shan't be necessary.\"\u00a0The Knight stopped momentarily to think, motionless save for the quiet heaving of his shoulders with each breath. \"You drive a difficult bargain m'lady, but methinks you're well aware of that.

As the Brother came closer a better inspection would reveal it had much inscription upon it; the work of Smiths giving their markings for proper documentation in trade purposes if Viktoriya had sufficient knowledge of the world outside Toragana. Bolko strolled forward too and flourished an axe, letting it spin idly in his hands. \"Let us then agree on an approximate price for a single man hired, and then we can agree what the opening fee is. You can at will place your finger along the length of this here bauble and Brother Bolko will remove enough to satisfy the demand.

I'll do my best to relay the details of the enemy as I recruit, hopefully the men will prepare themselves accordingly, this information is certainly a boon, far more than many contracts give us to go off of.\" she remarked, doing her best to assuage any worries Lazar might have about capability, whilst also acknowledging his needs and thanking him for the additional details. Details like this were actually quite enticing as a pitch, it sounds like an easy job, even to the rusty ex-cavalier herself. She may even join the battle, if it seemed things were going well after the initial charge.A smirk crept onto her lips as Lazar mentioned her devious bartering, and that she would succeed in her negotiations for her wit. \"Is there any other kind, Knight Lazar? I thank you graciously for agreeing to my terms, I promise you you won't regret it.\" she said with that wicked grin. The woman watched closely as a weighty chunk of gold was brought from one of the saddlebags. Viktoriya was quick to creep in for a closer look. Slightly damaged, but the seal seemed legitimate. She had limited expertise when it came to fine metals, but she knew enough to know a real inscription from a fake one. She then looked back to Lazar as he gave further instructions as to exactly what he was stewing with this unusual demonstration.\"Naturally, I have no great desire to con a group of men who most definitely carry more power than they appear. As for your typical wage...long travel, but low risk. The job itself shouldn't take us more than a few days. Most men are expecting a few gold a day...I'd say something close to 15..maybe 20 gold a man to see it through to the end, which'd make your cost about...4000 gold pieces, maybe more, if I can find more men. I'd recommend an initial stipend of 3 gold, that'd more than cover travel expenses there and back and their family expenses while they're gone, if the job were to go bust. It doesn't assume too much risk on our part either, for anyone slimy enough to take the money and run. Seem fairly priced to you?\" she asked, her eyes searching upwards, brows tightly furrowed as she did her best to give a good estimate of what the labour costs would be.She didn't address his final comments on their future endeavours, she'd made her point on that already and it seemed he agreed.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "She gave a curt little bow of her head as Lazar went about addressing her concerns and going on correcting or fixing them as best he could. She was quite thankful the knight was willing to barter, and it showed good faith that he took her thoughts seriously when it came to planning out what was to come, though whether this was out of respect for her or a fixation on succeeding in his quest to cleanse the southern steppe she couldn't really say. In truth, it didn't really matter to her either way, if he would agree to her terms whatever drove that action was irrelevant to a major extent.
