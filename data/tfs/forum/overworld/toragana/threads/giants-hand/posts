No blood is to be spilled here on neutral ground, a rule created so that traders of all kinds would be drawn to the city.No one tribe or nation rules Giant\u2019s Hand: a council of leaders come together to elect a temporary leader for a term. At present, the council has elected Sarita-Sonam as the city\u2019s governor. Giant\u2019s Hand is truly the city of travelers, as most of its structures are temporary, rising and falling as merchants come and go. Only the walls, citadel, and barracks are made from the mountain proper. Guards are stationed at the two main entrances, one of which is a drawbridge over a perilous fall. The other is a cave stairway carved into the mountain, so narrow only two people can walk snugly side-by-side.Within, a plethora of colorful wares and people can be found. One will be hailed left and right by eager merchants trying to sell their wares. There is no shortage of what can be sold: livestock, textiles, spices, weapons, services? It\u2019s all here, and even if you can\u2019t find exactly what you\u2019re looking for, there\u2019s almost certainly a way to make it instead.In the center of the bazaar sits a marble statue of the five tribe leaders that built Giant\u2019s Hand. Their names have been lost to time, but their will carries on in the city\u2019s design. They are depicted reaching out, each offering something different.", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/3280/toragana", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/user/3090"], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/IVzrEuX.png"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><font face=\"times new roman\" size=\"6\"><b>Giant's Hand</b></font><br><br/><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/IVzrEuX.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/></br></div>"}, "post-85042": {"user": "Sarita-Sonam", "user_num": 3090, "timestamp": "1536809165000", "message": "The rising sun painted the canvas of clouds with the color of dawn. It dripped down onto the walls of the stronghold, lathering the dull stone in dancing pinks and purples.A layer of morning dew had turned to frost and webbed the ground. Sturdy leather boots crunched over it, pacing back and forth, once, twice, thrice. Then, calmly, they stopped, heels knocking together, toes pointed forward. They faced a whole row of other feet, some booted, some bare, others that weren't feet at all. Every single one was still.\"You have been called here today for an important mission,\" said a voice: strong, mature, but feminine. \"There exists a world beyond our mountains. A world previously unknown to us, filled with opportunities and danger.\"The boots paced again, passing by the line. \"You are the swiftest and most adaptable of us all. You can scale sheer cliffs and ride through neverending deserts. There exists no natural obstacle that can stop you. Because of this, you have been chosen to be our explorers: offer us your legs, your eyes, your voices. Find what is out there and report back to us. Bring heroes and traders to our door; teach us of the villains and monsters that we wish to keep out.\"A lean arm lifted, gesturing to the balcony that hung over a fathomless drop. \"Go! Let it be known that Giant's Hand is here! That Toragana stands tall and is ready for the world!\"Every pair of legs bolted toward the overhang on command, leaping into the crisp air and off into the descent before it. Not one would meet a\u00a0rocky death below. A few sprouted glorious wings or caught the wind below flaps of skins between their limbs. Others chose to use umbrellas or flying carpets. In the flurry, it seemed that someone was riding a cloud. Others simply defied gravity by sheer force of will, urging forward with arms outstretched.A smile came to the face of Sarita-Sonam, the governor\u00a0of Giant's Hand. They had not known the world beyond in countless years, and soon Toragana would be flooded with visitors from far and wide. Many of the tribes were against it, but her term was already coming to an end. This task was a parting gift.Satisfied with her sendoff, the stern-faced woman opened the stronghold doors and wandered out into the bazaar, where early morning preparations were taking place for a busy day of trading. She parted her fur\u00a0hood and wrapped it around her neck, keeping the cold air out of the neck of her tunic. This revealed a chestnut face and slanted eyes. Dark, but delicate lines drew under her eyes, marking a woman who was no longer young, but not yet old. She glided across the stone floor with a straight back, chin up, eyes forward. Everyone she passed offered a wave or a bow.\"A good morning to you, Saso! You are out before most of us even have time to prepare!\" called an older man, back hunched from years of lifting wares. She nodded to him, smiling tightly.\u00a0\"I always patrol before sunrise, Seyang. You would not notice, as you snore like a bull at that hour.\"The man chuckled grumpily at her remark before returning to work, displaying a variety of blades across his tables. A few stalls down, a girl was selling bottles and small cases filled with spices used for food and drink. The governor paused to turn one of the bottles over and scrutinize it, eyes flickering up to the teenaged merchant.\"Dangerous to display galroot powder on your table, little Cham. Put this away immediately: only those who ask should be shown this. Did Yuzana teach you nothing?\"The rosy-cheeked girl, who was struggling to keep an oversized fur hat out of her eyes, looked down in shame. \"Forgive me, Saso... I am only setting up and there was only a little time...!\"Sarita's chest heaved in a sigh and shook her head. \"Very well, girl. It looks like I will be your teacher today.

Observers would look twice, no doubt surprised to see the banner of the Teng Clan fluttering in the brisk wind.  It was a rare but welcomed sight.  The royal escort was composed of Tenzin: the new Tsenpo of Mabet, along with his councilors and household guard.The journey was originally intended as a diplomatic mission.  Tenzin ascended to the throne of Mabet after the mysterious death of his father.  The former Tsenpo was killed on his way to a diplomatic summit with the Khan of the Tamorjin, although many - like Tenzin himself - believed that his father was killed by the Khan himself.  Formalities aside, Tenzin\u2019s trip was necessary to ward off any prospects the other clans had of attacking a leaderless Mabet.There was also the matter of Sarita-Sonam\u2019s announcement.  She may have been the elected governor of Giant\u2019s Hand, but she was still Teng.  Her choice to invite foreigners into Toragana was met with harsh criticism back home - at least from the Traditionalists; it was hard enough, they thought, keeping other clans out of their precious valley, now they would have to deal with an influx of foreigners?  It was the urging of these Traditionalists, headed by the old coot Rigsan, which agitated Tenzin the most.  But in order to rule Mabet and the Teng Valley, the Tsenpo had to heed their words lest he lose their support.And with the rousing and raising of an armed escort came the cries of the merchants.  It was not time to send out another trading caravan, but the traders did not want to miss out on a chance to sell their goods at Giant\u2019s Hand.  After much debate with Rigsan and his Traditionalists, Tenzin decreed a caravan be formed and allowed to travel with the royal guard.  This was met with mixed reactions within the council, but the Tsenpo\u2019s decision was not challenged.As they neared the drawbridge of Giant\u2019s Hand Tenzin\u2019s childhood friend, Tsundue, was awed.  \u201cWhat a world awaits the Teng,\u201d he commented.  Tsundue was a strong, brash warrior who was not only Tenzin\u2019s closest friend and adviser, but also his favored bodyguard.  He was built like an oak, with a broad chest and long bushy beard.  Although the Tsenpo admired his strength and friendship, he was often at odds with Rigsan and had flared the old man\u2019s temper in the past.As they approached the guards at the drawbridge Tenzin held up his hand to stop his column.  \u201cI\u2019m here to see the governor, Sarita-Sonam.

They are homogenously Angelists, the faith I represent. But they are conversely stubborn, cynical, suspicious, militaristic \u2014 though not exactly warmongers.

From toiling the most foul mud into bountiful crops to crafting advanced mechanisms they will most certainly contribute to this city once they hear of the boons in taking part in the system. The country was forged in war, and it has both slowed and driven their development. There is only one grand city in analogue of this one, but its industry insures even the lowest conscript gets full plate to stop arrows like pebbles. It only has two ethnicities broadly grouped major ethnic groups, the Vessians and the Wickans. The former were settlers from a few dozen years back, coming to the land in conquest and for settlement. The Wickans were the natives, people largely worshipping vile Gods with sacrificial rituals and all the horrifying things one could imagine from a religion. The Vessians were far more numerous and advanced coming from a different, quite massive continent and far more advanced with plate, crossbows, ordinance, and a God that wasn't quite as foul. The Vessians won and formed a state ruled by the Knightly Order that spearheaded the campaign of settlement and conquest. Now the Wickans have been largely integrated, some grudgingly, but most not. They keep their language but sing the same anthems, pray the same prayers. The people there look somewhat different than me usually, more pale skin, fair hair, light eyes.

Better than calling her Manny, which has crossed her mind. \u201cThere is so much here, after being on the trail for so long\u2026 it is a little overwhelming.
