Another time, it was a maze filled with surprises around every corner, urging her to be wary of her surroundings.Several weeks passed. Two moons swept across the sky as Nasrin trained the girl from the hunter into a warrior. Still, the witch realized that these tests were not sufficient enough to learn real battle and that she would have to rectify that.One day, when Chinua woke up, she would find that the hallway door was not open today.Behind her, light poured into the room from behind, precious sunlight that she had not seen in an age.Another woman stood there, just a little taller than the girl, and more than twice her age. Heavy leathers and furs adorned her small frame. They were strikingly alike; in many more years, the warrior might have seen that same face staring back in the mirror.With her thin lips, she smiled \u2014 wrinkles formed at her eyes and the sides of her mouth.\"So you are Chinua,\" the older woman stated, voice soft but firm.  She handed the huntress a bundle of warm clothing she'd been holding. \"I am Nergui. You will be coming out with me today, to the fields.\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "As the sun sank and rose again, Chinua would find a new challenge awaiting her. As the pain in her head ebbed, she would find herself with more bruises to nurse the next day. The hallway would change from day to day, usually with complicated wooden constructions.

Nasrin had kept her busy enough that she hadn't had time to think about how much she missed the outside worlds, far from the confines of the room she'd been thrown into all those weeks ago. But the moment she had a taste of it again, she knew she needed more. But still, there was a touch of hesitation as she processed the woman's words and her eyes narrowed as she slowly sat up. She'd built a surprising amount of muscle over the weeks and was coiled tight like a spring ready to strike as she considered the other woman. Her eyes flicked from the warm clothes to the woman, to the outside she longed to be in. \"... And why is that exactly? What will we do there? Who sent you to get me?\" And why do you look so much like... me? She asked all but the last question aloud, though she felt as if she already knew the answers.

She'd worn it nigh religiously since she'd won it from her first solo hunt out of respect for the animal and as a demonstration of pride. Her blood surged slightly at the thought of some demons having pawned off or throwing her items to waste. She could only hope that it still existed somewhere in the place she'd been taken. But in truth, Chinua only had moments to think of this all, as she hurried her feet to follow the other woman. It was not as if she had much else to do. And though tempting, it seemed Nasrin had actually knocked some sense into her as she didn't go blindly rushing off to slaughter. There would be a time for that. But for now, she was curious about what exactly this woman had in store for her and where it would go. Especially if it meant she'd be outside in the fresh air once more. Despite being locked up in the room, Nasrin's training had kept her fit and strong so she was easily able to catch up with the woman and keep pace. It surprised her how fast the woman went- none of the others of her village had been able to quite keep pace with her. It was odd to have someone match- or even exceed her stride. Though Chinua reasoned it must be the lack of room to run. \"I hope it was Nasrin who sent you and not the demon who hides in the skin of a man. He'd not only be a demon but also a fool if he thought allowing me free to roam and ride was in his best interest.\" She said as she held the clothing tight to her chest, her feet lightly padding along the tile below them. \"But why has Nasrin been called to him to begin with?\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Chinua blinked as she suddenly had her arms full of unfamiliar clothing.
