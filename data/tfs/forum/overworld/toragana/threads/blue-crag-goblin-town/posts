You can vaguely see torches lighting the roughly hewn tunnel.\u00a0Deeper on lies a great chamber, going down at least a hundred feet. Multitudes of rickety wooden staircases, bridges, and ladders crisscross the large hole, and you can see many tunnels that connect to what seems to be the main area of this Goblin-Town.Looking down to the bottom of the chamber, you can see several campfires, upon which are various animals cooking and pots boiling. There is a section with a large chair, and atop sits a large, humanoid figure: Throdhas, leader of the Blue-Crag clan.\u00a0Around him swarm many goblins of different sizes and builds, all doing their jobs.\u00a0To the left and right of you are ledges leading to the various ladders, bridges, and staircases.\u00a0----------------------------------------------The forge room is one of the many smaller specific chambers in the Goblin town. Here, there are about a dozen forges and a dozen more workbenches. Several goblins toil here, making armor and weapons, as well as repairing them.\u00a0----------------------------------------------The store-room contains a great deal of materials, from skins of animals to piles of firewood and wood for building things. There is also a side of the roughly rectangular room dedicated to various foodstuffs, mostly non-perishables.\u00a0----------------------------------------------The treasure room, one of the smaller chambers, has a large quantity of wooden chests. Each one contains gold, silver, jewelry, and other valuables. Two trolls guard the entrance, and inside there are two warg-riders.\u00a0---------------------------------------------There are a great deal of small chambers nestled throughout the expansive tunnel system, where the goblins, trolls, wargs, and the few orcs and half-orcs sleep. There are several bunk beds in each.\u00a0---------------------------------------------The armory is where all of the unused weapons and armor are kept. There are multitudes of racks on each wall, each containing many weapons, chestplate, helmets, shields, and the like.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "A dark tunnel lies before you, going straight into the mountain.
