Led by the flagship, Forward Unto Victory, the Company warships dropped anchor off the south-eastern coast of this new continent. A legion of rowboats, hustling Company Marines and Sailors, drifted across the waves to land on the shores.Lord Arthur Perceval was the first to set foot on the sands. As the marines and sailors of the company made about establishing a working dockyard of sorts to bring about more supplies, Arthur found a staging point for further expedition inland. A little over an hour passed, and a perimeter was established, and tents were pitched upon the beach. No smoke rose over the camp, as the day was still young.Horses were brought from the frigates, given to those picked to ride with Perceval, and the troops rode north west, travelling inward and keeping the landing point to their backs. The trailblazers were in search of anything upon this new land.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.pinimg.com/originals/24/c9/76/24c976c415c3b90f4fd40249dfa2dddf.jpg"], "html": "<i style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Ships of war.\u00a0</i>"}, "post-90124": {"user": "Jungsai", "user_num": 3416, "timestamp": "1557516737000", "message": "They had spotted them from a ways off, the ships. They were like white clouds on the water at first, perplexing a few of the Tarandi tribe as they rode toward the bay.This far into spring, there was little snow near the beaches, so the herd of silvery snow camels stuck out against the grasslands like a running iceberg. They were quite different than a desert camel, with no humps on their backs to store water and long horns on their heads that more closely resembled an antelope's. Their splayed hooves did help traverse them swiftly through the soggy grasslands, wet from all the snow that had melted days prior.When the horses were deployed from the ships, one of the camel riders peeled off from his herd to intercept them. He came in from the side, the camel much faster than the average horse, which might have come as a surprise from those who did not spend much time around these animals. Greeting them was a young boy, spry and grinning. He had done away with his woolen coat and wore a brightly colored linen deel beneath, celebrating the warm season. His mount had no saddle or even a bridle: he was leading it by the mane.For a moment it seemed as though he was trying to race them, urging the snow camel forward to the front of their company with a laugh.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "They had spotted them from a ways off, the ships.
