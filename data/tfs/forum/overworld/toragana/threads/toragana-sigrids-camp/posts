It is an eldritch barrier cloaked in blinding mists where only the bravest - or foolish - dare embark.  Sails are ripped from their masts amidst the high winds, jagged rocks pierce the hulls of any ship, and hungry maelstroms swallow fleets whole with the fury of the Old Gods.The superstitious believe the Maw is corrupted with a foul magic.  Or perhaps it is the home of aquatic behemoths, whose shifting movements agitate the waters with great ferocity.  Regardless of the truth, this sea is not place for the faint-hearted.But Sigrid the Hateful and her band of warriors are not faint-hearted.  The volva had made up her mind and was determined to cross the Maw, and there was none aboard the ships who would challenge her.Idda does not see much of her new master once they leave Taingaard.  Her men feed her and shelter her, but she remains bound at the prow of the longship.  It seems Sigrid brings up fresh captives from below deck every day - a man, a woman, sometimes human and other times a different race entirely.An incantation is given and the volva cuts the throat of the prisoner.  The blood is collected and, again, another incantation.  The red liquid is poured over a series of carved stones no bigger than Idda\u2019s palm.  After this old ritual is complete glowing runes can be seen inscribed on the face of each stone.  It is Sigrid\u2019s magic at work.Using the powers of the runes Sigrid alters the winds to carry them northeast around Asgeir at a remarkable pace - and further east still into the dreaded waters of the Maw.  The nights grow long, the winds begin to pick up, and the longships struggle to stay together in the dense, unworldly fog.  They have entered the Maw.--<>--Standing at the prow of her ship, the volva embraces each spray of salt water as it stings her face.  A torrential downpour drenches the crew of each longship.  A strong easterly wind, as if blown from the mouths of the Old Gods themselves carries the fleet along to its destination.  Great waves of outstanding size threatening to capsize each ship crash off of fang-shaped rocks.  It is a horrific experience, but expected.  Fanatic zealots aboard the longships return the Maw\u2019s challenge with taunts and howls.The Maw had cast it\u2019s threat at Sigrid, and the volva had tamed it.  A Stone of Winds to manipulate the howling gusts of wind, forcing the baleful air currents to carry them east, and to clear away the mists.  A Stone of Storms to frighten the nightmares who lurk in the depths below the fleet.  A Stone of the Seas whose enchantment urges the waves not to capsize the ships, but to carry them ever onward and over the jagged rocks.When her magic begins to wane and she can feel control over the elements slipping from her grasp Sigrid merely draws another stone and pulls the magic from it to remind the Maw that she is its master.  For what seems like days the fleet perseveres until a day comes when one of the sailors finally cries out:\u201cLANDFALL!\u201d--<>--While the Varan did revel in the challenge that the Maw brought, they were all happy to see the coast once more.  Great, snow-capped mountains could be seen in the distance and it reminded Sigrid and her followers of home; they could only hope this was no barren landscape, and were eager to find villages and towns to plunder or trade with.The northern coasts were dangerous; jagged rocks and high cliffs forced the fleet to sail eastward along the coastline for hours until they found a suitable landing spot.  The longships were pulled ashore and the sailors wasted no time in removing the cargo and setting up a temporary camp.  The establishment of a beachhead, where the raiders could rest and prepare to move inland, was important.Sigrid observed the construction of the camp from atop a hill overlooking the shore with a stern composure.  She had ordered her champions to bring Idda to the top as well.  \u201cLeave us,\u201d she told them, and they returned to their duties down below.\u201cI have been busy with my rituals, girl,\u201d she began.  \u201cBut a journey which should have taken months, even years, has only taken a few days.\u201d  She finally turned to look at Idda, her expression plain.  \u201cBut now that we are here\u2026 who are you?\u201d", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The Varan of Asgeir have always referred to the churning oceans of the east as "}, "post-87402": {"user": "Idda 'Ironfrost' Valdir", "user_num": 3261, "timestamp": "1543774790000", "message": "Idda remained bound in the compartment of the longboat and the constant rocking of the boat wasn't exactly comforting and only got worse as they sailed into a storm - a storm that seemed to have no intention of seizing. She was kept prisoner along with a group of other persons and once in a while one of them were called up on deck and Idda imagined the tall woman was assigning them the most dangerous job on the ship seeing as none of them came back down again. She wondered when it was her turn to be 'rehabilitated' on deck, but apparently that time didn't come until she heard someone shouting that land was nearby and the cheering that followed. All this time she had remained bound like a nice and compliant prisoner and even spoken nicely to the guards and with the other prisoners - although most were to scared or sea sick to be very interesting conversational material. She would no doubt have been able to cast those ropes off her hands given a little time by herself, but she figured there were smarter times to seek freedom that in the middle of an apocalyptic gale and thus Idda bid her time.And the time came as the ship finally came to a stand still and the last trace of the hurricane had evaporated. Idda wondered where they had been taken to but were about to see for herself very soon as one of the warriors commanded her to follow him. Of course she obliged - she was still a nice prisoner after all and even to the chief's knowledge she was nothing but an unlucky horse thief and the longer she could maintain that ruse the better she thought.\u00a0They had embarked on a beach and looking over the rolling hills and snow clad mountains it wasn't that different from Taingaard - and how could it be given it was only a few days they had traveled. Still she figured it wasn't Asgeir they had traveled to due to how this all seemed unfamiliar to the crew. The tour up to the peak was harder than she had imagined. The wounds from they day she had been caught had been relatively shallow and gave her little to no trouble, but being tightly confined with little light and not much room to stretch her legs for few days had left her body stiff and unwilling. Escape wasn't in the cards quite yet - and furthermore it seemed like the tall lady wanted to speak with her directly.\u00a0\"Busy with... your rituals..?\" Idda asked confused that those were her initial words. However a it took only a few moments to imagine how those rituals and the prisoners connected - apparently she was able to sail through the storm and emerge here due to whatever ritual she had performed on deck. \"So you're a witch.\" she concluded. \"That's impressive.\" Idda added with a slightly wry smile forming - and she was being quite sincere having met few others that possessed such single minded ability to fulfill their goals regardless of the cost. It was clearly not a coincidence that Idda had been brought here and whether she would end up as a material for another ritual, this presented an opportunity and she changed her tactic hoping to prove her potential value as an ally rather than a tool. There were still other prisoners to pick from and she aimed to be the last that would be chosen for one of her rituals.\u00a0\"Well I was the leader of a small band of free soldiers until they branded us 'bandits' - but I really have no idea what this situation makes me. However I'm quite handy with an axe - or two.\" she said with an innocent voice as she discretely worked the ropes behind her back hoping that the tall lady had either already taken interest in her and that she was able to pique that interest even further. Should this fail Idda hoped she could stall her long enough to wrench the ropes off her wrists and make a run for it.

While aboard the longship Idda was fed better than the other prisoners - that was because she was not a prisoner unlike the slaves she had been with below deck.  Sigrid was pleased to see the young lady did not lose her health.The volva\u2019s attention focused on what Idda had to say next: about her leading a party of soldiers.  This was good to hear, for the young shield-maiden had already experienced both combat and leadership.\u201cI\u2019m trying to figure out why I should keep you alive, girl.  I paid good coin for you - you and your friends.

This is the land of Horse Lords, Giants, and Orges.  A land which, if my sources were correct, is ripe for plunder.  Warlords prepare for war; as armies march to battle, towns will be void of fighting men; we will strike and take what we want.  Where it is wise we shall trade.  And when the time comes, if it proves necessary, we shall sell ourselves as mercenaries to these foreign warlords.  In time we shall enrich ourselves with the treasures of these people and return home.\u201d  She shrugged, \u201cor perhaps we shall settle here and carve out a kingdom of our own.\u201dSigrid finished pacing around the girl and paused in front of her, drawing a dagger.  \u201cSo, girl... tell me your name, and tell me how you could be of any use to me.

Those aren't my friends I was just incarcerated there with them..!\" Idda protested not wishing to be put in the same boat as the others she had been sold with. In reality she didn't know how much gold the chief had received but it seemed that he had received enough so that the lady wanted to be sure she would get their worth back. She sounded greedy - and frankly Idda couldn't blame her as she would probably have done the same had the roles been reversed. At least Idda wasn't worthy for being sacrificed it seemed.\u00a0\"It doesn't resemble anything I've seen before no.\" she said with a plain face before listening to the lady's plan of conquest - it started to sound like it was a 'join or die' proposition and as the lady suddenly drew her knife threateningly this was confirmed to be true. Idda gulped and a few drops of sweat ran down her forehead. Sure she had been in life and death battles before but faced with this kind of threat while unable to defend properly - of course she was afraid which. This made it all the more difficult to explain where the courage to speak the next words came from.\u00a0\"I don't sing very well..!\" Idda exclaimed with a nervous half smile hoping the lady would be caught off guard the mundane explanation to why she wouldn't fit the role as tavern wench very well. But assuming humor could be in short supply she quickly added the next words that might be taken as insolence had they not been spoken so sincerely. \"I want to conquer too! If you sold me as tavern wench I'd burn the tavern to the ground and band together those that might fight with me and you'd have another enemy - one that wouldn't bend easily! So either you kill me and start mourning your lost gold or you take me with you on your conquest..!\" Idda stated.

Idda felt her sore wrists but did not complaining about it - being acknowledged was all she cared about right now as it meant living another day and being able to yet again fight for a purpose. Idda followed Sigrid down to the camp trying to readjust herself to suddenly being part of this group of plunderers and so called 'merchants'. \"I have nothing against them, but I would slay any of them without hesitation if necessary.\" Idda commented about the other Taingaardians she had been sold with. She genuinely didn't really care about them and thus she was fine with whatever role the lady wanted them to play. She might talk about brotherhood and the likes but when she glanced into the lady's eyes she knew they were but pawns for her ambitions - and Idda was again quite impressed by how she ruled her underlings.
