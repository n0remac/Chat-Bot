A place few can find unless they know where too, hidden by the ever-falling snow. The walls of Moon-Howl Monestary looked out on the beautiful vista of the Twilight Gorge letting the gaze of the lone man standing upon them wander for miles on end for the brief moment of respite in the near constant state of wind blown snow and ice. \u201cMaybe I should have taken up painting.\u201d He said to himself with a quiet laugh before he turned away as the winds began to howl once more, hiding the view in a fog of snow. Down the stairs and through the courtyard and into the small city itself. It was a beautiful if simple place, with a mix of architecture. Built over several decades out of locally quarried stone in a different age, each building was slightly different, and each told a story of the people working on it, a chiseled signature here, corners edged with elvish glyphs there, a dwarven guild Mark there. He occasionally brushed his fingers across these marks and smiled to himself a bit sadly as he remembered names and faces, most were gone now, taken before their time. After long minutes of meandering walking he reached the main building at the back of the complex and pushed the doors open with a creaking of wood and a squeal of protesting hinges, quickly shutting them again with a hollow boom that echoed through the halls so as to keep the heat inside. He turned to observe the hallway and sighed. He did not regret his work but sometimes it hurt as he felt the weight of the handful of stone gazes that fell upon him. Lining the hall were alcoves carved into the wall and in some of them were lifelike stone statues, each depicting a man or woman and a great wolf in various poses, each carved with excruciating attention to detail to the point where one would not be surprised if they began to breathe and move about. He shook his head and headed further into the winding passageways of the monetary proper, feeling stone eyes watching him silently as he passed dozens of statues and finally found himself in the main chamber with his latest project. Eloen the Swift. A lively elven warrior, she had always found herself more comfortable with a sword in hand then with a pen though she had also been one of their brightest members. She had also been one of the few to gain the guise of a fae direwolf so he had had to procure a larger stone then usual and it would take longer to carve, but he had time. He had nothing but\u00a0time these days. Time and melancholy memories of days past, where the little lights in his mind representing members of his pack had numbered in the hundreds, instead of the bare handful of burning sparks that burned there now. A choked sob escaped his lips before he growled low in his throat and brushed away the glistening beginnings of tears before picking up hammer and chisel. He could cry later, for now there was work to do, he throughly as he brought chisel to stone and hammer to chisel, and chips of rock began to fall.

Though her stride was intensely powerful, even she had problems making her way through this infernal, frosty obstacle ahead. Her lungs heaved, stinging her lungs with frost, and her whole body ached with fatigue, but one glance backward reminded her body why she kept going.There, she spotted the hulking boulder of a monster rushing after her, his path less burdened due to the trail she left behind. He roared as he battled uphill toward her, pulling tears and screams from his fleeing prey.He was clad in the furry skins of dead animals- some kin, some not- and held a wicked battle ax in his meaty fingers. One of his strides easily equaled two of hers, but she had four legs to push her forward. He had half that.With a defiant screech, she plowed through the snow toward the city she had spotted not a league back through the mountains.

She fiddled with the door briefly, thin fingers stiff from the cold, and strained to pull it open before she rushed inside. She grabbed the door and closed it, hoping that it would give her a moment more to get ahead.Hollow clops echoed through the hall, pausing only once she turned and gazed at the hundreds of figures before her.

Once she was able to discern that she wasn't surrounded by real people, she urged forward, galloping through the halls, pale and grey, almost as though one of the statues had come to life.\"Help me!
