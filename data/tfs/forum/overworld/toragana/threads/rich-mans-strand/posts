Although no outpost or manmade structures are in sight, the location proves surprisingly useful location for ships wishing to weather storms or to put down anchor and head ashore. Wildlife in the surrounding area is plentiful and for any skilled fisherman it is a trivial matter to bring in a plentiful haul of fish. Past the rocky shoreline lies forest that then give way to more hilly and mountainous terrain as one heads further inland.\u00a0Written by Wishsolen", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/AVRZOc8.png"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><font face=\"times new roman\" size=\"5\">The Rich Man's Strand</font></div>"}, "post-87981": {"user": "Makhaya the Prophet", "user_num": 1894, "timestamp": "1545967252000", "message": "If one was to stand on the shoreline, they would see a rather peculiar sight, to say the least. It was clearly a seafaring vessel that was approaching, but to simply call it a ship wouldn\u2019t do it justice. Both the front and back of the vessel were rather deeply curved, steps embedded at numerous locations on the deck of the craft to keep its occupants upright. The color of the vessel was a bold yellow, clearly whoever rode on this ship had no fear of being spotted. Even massive sails that propelled it forward were yellow in color, although a softer and more calming hue of it. Any who were familiar with bananas would immediately see what the design of the ship mimicked. Makhaya stood the prow of the ship, hands clasped together in prayer, eyes closed. Although precariously close to having a single misstep send him tumbling overboard, his strong toes gripped the decking of the ship and gave him steady footing despite his position. Taking in a deep breath, the gorilla slowly smiled as the scent of bananas and salt filled his nostrils. They had banana oil aplenty and it was being put to good use on the ship.It had taken many days and nights, but finally, they were approaching the coast of Toragana. Turning away from the distant outline of the mainland, Makhaya ambled over to Rune, his recently hired bodyguard. Despite him being young, Makhaya had a good feeling about the man's abilities, that arm wrestling match had certainly been an intriguing demonstration. \u201cIt\u2019s been a bit of a trip, but we\u2019ve finally arrived here, Master Rune.

Motioning Rune to join him and a few of his followers in one of the several rowboats they had, Makhaya made no waste having the boat carefully lowered from the deck of the ship down to the water below. Once it was safely detached from the main vessel, the two followers he had brought along began rowing the pair towards the shore.\u201cWell, it\u2019s a bit of a shot in the dark, Master Rune, but do you have any suggestions in which direction we should travel in if my goal is to find the local people of this place?

Further up shore, the gravel beach gave way to rolling hills, and even further in the distance loomed the distant shadow of a mountain to the north.In the meantime, Rune helped get his donkey off the boat\u00a0and mounted up.\u00a0\"Whatever path you choose, Makhaya, I'm ready to accompany you!\"", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "\"I don't know.
