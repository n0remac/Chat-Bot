The sea floor in areas this deep is blacker than the darkest midnight, and could with no exaggeration be described as the cold, crushing abyss.However, if one were to search the ocean\u2019s floor in the right place, they might find a great, jagged chasm; one that looks as if it were made by the foot of a God as it was walking the planet\u2019s seabed. Standing on one edge of the great chasm, an explorer would be able to see nothing but a shining, glowing city nestled in the bottom of the hole, its warm diffuse light splitting the crushing blackness of the water for miles.This is Llorosh, Holy City of Aldea. Densely populated with all manner of sea life, the bustling markets and centuries old architecture surround the cultural center of the city; the Temple of Aldea. The streets, passages and seaways leading to the religious, economic and residential sectors are constantly lit by bioluminescent lamps which keep the city in a perpetual state of warm, glowing light.The city welcomes all travelers, merchants, residents, and of course professing children of Aldea.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/1Y1gs5c.jpg"], "html": "<p align=\"center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/1Y1gs5c.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/></p>"}}
