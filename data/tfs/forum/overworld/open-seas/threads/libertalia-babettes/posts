Nestled between buildings, a large, hand painted sign stretches up and down the middle of of the building, sideways, that simply reads Babette's. The building itself is about three stories, with dark wooden support beams intersecting the white plaster exterior, and each floor with four latticed windows looking down into the street.\u00a0Though the outside is unassuming, the true nature of this building is only revealed when one steps inside. when one moves through the front door, they would be presented with a reception desk and a very large man, obviously a bouncer. Behind the curtains on either side, however, is a lavishly decorated parlour, lit by the dim light of candles and enchanted lamps with their panes painted a light red. A bar small bar sits at the back, opposite a stage with a large pole going from stage to ceiling.\u00a0Couches, lounges and large pillows litter the main room, perfect for someone to sit back and relax, perhaps with a shisha or hooka to relax the nerves, or maybe some complimentary pipe-weed or a narcotic of choice? There are no judgements at Babette's.\u00a0However, this is no lounge or drug den. No, the people don't come here for the comfy atmosphere or wonderful cocktails. They come for the scantily clad men and ladies that inhabit these lounges and couches, each one available at a price, and each one as beautiful and exotic as the last. Each one has an assigned room, all decorated to the inhabitant's specifications, and each catering for a different interest.\u00a0Babette's Bordello is owned by the Admiralty, there's no secret about that, with the profits going to city projects, but its operated and managed by Madame Babette Singh, a beautiful elvish lady, with dark skin, striking pale blue eyes, and beautifully maintained black hair, often seen hosting and entertaining guests in her lavish outfits and beautiful jewellery. She was once touted as the city's premier lady-of-the-night, and though retired at the age of two hundred (though not looking a day over thirty), there are a few she will entertain privately\u00a0for an absurdly large price.\u00a0Even though she may look fancy and delicate, she is an expert with a rapier, and will protect her employees with her life, and is often likely to win. Some say the beefy bouncers are just for show, and that Babette lays down the law, but nobody is willing to test that theory.\u00a0Looking to let off some steam? Spend some of your new found Libertalian wealth? Or just lonely? Come down to Babette's and let her beautiful ladies and men take care of you.\u00a0", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/3565/libertalia"], "image_list": [], "html": "<a href=\"http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/3565/libertalia\" rel=\"norewrite\" style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:large;\" target=\"_blank\">Libertalia</a>"}, "post-92964": {"user": "Desdemona McHerne", "user_num": 3533, "timestamp": "1565194870000", "message": "Entering the Babbete\u2019s with O\u2019Malley, Desdemona\u2019s lips relaxed in a pleasant smile of comfort.
