After doing this for a good half-hour, he gathered them up and stood, moving his way over towards Wolfgang. \"There's a large stone that protrudes, isolated, from the surface of the sea. It is half a day to the northwest, but should stand higher than the sails of this ship. The spirits guide us there, then heed we turn north and sail straight for as long as it takes us to find first land.\"The strange warrior gave no explanation as to his methods or reasons for being able to navigate to such an isolated feature far out to sea, but seemed so entirely confident in his directions he moved back down the deck until he came across the falconer and the injured hawk. Again, with little explanation, he opened his bag of herbs and took out several small, peculiar yellow leaves. \"Form these into a paste. They will help to control the bird's pain. But do not feed it these leaves, for to a creature this size they will be toxic and deadly.

He leaned over them, looking into the sea with utmost cautious, though he could not see beneath the moving current. It was then that a spear came hurling towards the ship at frightening speed, causing Vale to duck, though this spear merely sailed over the crew and hit the water again on the other side of the vessel. And then came three more, then three again, thrown blindly from beneath the ocean without care for whether they missed completely, pierced the sides of the ship or killed members of the crew. \"Leave thissss place, those-who-walk!\" Came the voice of a female, her growl as ferocious as her hiss.

Vale turned to Wolfgang and nodded, his suggestion being that they head north and leave the area as soon as possible. In the distance, however, far to the south, the currents of the ocean began to suddenly rise and waves spilled over against themselves, sending large ripples down towards the area of the standing stone that were enough to cause the ship to rock.Suddenly, another female burst out of the ocean. \"It iss here!\" She screeched, \"the Doomssea hass followed the landwalkerss!\"The female in charge let out a screech of her own, breaking all possibility of peace. \"The landwalkerss have led it to uss!

It was accompanied by the screeching ordering of the seafolk's leader, who seemed to direct all her companions to turn and face the Doomsea instead.As the seafolk began to combat the ancient monster and the waves became more and more dangerous, Vale took an oar and yelled at the oarsmen to row.
