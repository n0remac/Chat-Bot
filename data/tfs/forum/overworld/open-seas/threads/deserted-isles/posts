No, it was the fact that whoever was summoning such apparitions was too damned distracted to keep them under perfect control. Or perhaps it was the architect's fault, allowing such distractions to manifest themselves in the first place.Either way, his boat was gone, shredded like paper by the daemon, and now he was stuck far too uncomfortably close to the crossfire between two powerful magi, and in the sort of mood that would drive men with lesser restraint to do something stupid.
