This is rather ironic given the management is a Prince of Hell but Ixdraynael is a firm believer on keeping track of what the immortality challenged are getting up to.The exterior edifice is simple, yet sturdy, giving the impression of a place that is welcoming to those of all walks of life. While it wouldn\u2019t appeal to the extremely affluent, it would not drive off the exceptionally poor or your average tradesmen. The plain grey brickwork, vaulted roof, and numerous windows suggest an interior that will be well lit and open.The interior lives up to the promise with a high ceiling that allows for clearance for even the tallest of the mortal races. The floor is done in tasteful hardwood, with a selection of round tables interspersed around numerous sturdy oak pillars. As one enters through the main floor they would see to the left a great fireplace large enough to roast an entire suckling pig over, to the right is a raised dais where live performances are often held, and directly in front is the main bar. A cherry wood countertop standing firm against the troubles of the world a selection of fine liquors from all around the world available for sale.\u00a0Beyond the main floor, located directly behind the bar, are the kitchens where numerous cooks work to keep the patrons well fed. To the left of the bar lies the way to the back rooms, including private dining rooms that can be rented out by the hour, as well as the stairs to the top floor where numerous rooms can be rented for the evening. Some who have stayed at the inn have noted that it seems to be larger inside than the exterior suggest, however, the owner is always quick to laugh such accurate assumptions off.\u00a0Enjoy your stay...", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://cdn.obsidianportal.com/assets/181183/2463.jpg", "https://i-h1.pinimg.com/564x/54/48/ea/5448ead5f98a3417adf1eec81fb3fcaf.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><b><u></u></b></div>"}, "post-85661": {"user": "Ixdraynael, The Endless Storm", "user_num": 3176, "timestamp": "1539044358000", "message": "The Isle With No Name, that had a name.

Still, it was one of those little absurdities a demon could appreciate with the benefit of dual perspective, it wasn't as though he was bound to the island like the poor sod who'd been saddled with the kingship. Nope, Ix did use Edan as a means of having a semi presence on the mortal plane but all he did with it was run an inn. Well, that wasn't all he did, of course, sure he may have a reputation as a bit of a shiftless rogue among the other Demon Prince's of Hell but that didn't mean he was idle. First, he crammed his essence into a somewhat mortal shell which was a pain in the ass, let me tell you. Then once he had a corporeal body he went to work at his bar in the mortal distract of Edan.But why would a demon want to work in the mortal district? Well, that was easy it was because the best way to get information about the mortal realm was by talking to mortal's, even the shut-ins that lived in Edan's mortal district. After all, you did occasionally get the occasional outside visitor or returning resident and you were far more likely to meet them when you ran a warm, comfortable, and reasonably priced inn. Plus it made a convenient place to meet his children when they came to visit. Which they never seemed to do. Ingrates. You raise them, train them, and protect them until they can fend for themselves and what do you get? \"We don't want to stay with you because you are evil and want them to open up a portal to your plane of hell so you could ravage the overworld as a great all-consuming storm!\" That was just children, you raise them to be good people and boom they become do-gooders! Just because he wanted them to mind their p's and q's and be respectful to people didn't mean he'd wanted them to not also have a callous disregard for mortal life. Ix never should have gotten them pets, it had set a poor precedent. Giving them an appreciation for life that they'd outlive by several hundred years. Although the cat had been really cute, the snake not so much, it had creeped him out. Anyway, we get distracted. Ix was the Demon Prince of The Circle of Lust and he ran a bar called \"The Lover's Storm\" in the largest mortal port on Edan. It saw a robust business, especially when he was on the floor, and served as his base of operations in the mortal plane as he did his best to gather intelligence about the material world. All so he could eventually convince one of his daughter's or a cult of mortal worshippers to open up a proper portal to hell. Those are the important bits of this story.At present, he was standing behind his bar absently polishing the expensive bottles of liquor he kept on hand for more discerning guest. It was a few hours before the bar opened and he was wearing a simple tunic and vest, his long curly hair rolling down his shoulders and back. His jacket and tophat resting on the bar as he admires his own reflection in a well polished glass bottle.

It was one of his favorites, though she'd hated it, because it represented the worst of man. The story goes like this: The village reeve sits in the local inn having had a bit too much to drink. He was a good reeve, well-liked and respected considered to be a good and pious man by all. However, he was prone to a lustful nature when he imbibed drink and that night when the bartender offered him one more round the reeve accepted, despite knowing he had already consumed too much.Perhaps nothing would have come of it except that night a pretty young widow was at the inn. She'd just moved to the town to stay with her family after her husband's death and the poor woman caught the intoxicated reeve's eye. While she wasn't willing, she did not refuse the lustful reeve as he was a man of power and like most serfs, she was not one to deny those with power. Perhaps nothing would have come of this but the widow was begotten with child and the scandalous rumor flared through the village like wildfire. Now the reeve was by all counts a good man, a pious man, and a loyal and dutiful husband. Yet there was no denying that he'd broken the vows of his marriage, however, he could not reconcile what he had done drunk with who he was sober. So he came to the only conclusion that he could, the widow had seduced him. Ho now, but no simple seductress could sway the heart of a good and pious man like the village reeve so she must have had help, magical help. The widow had used dark magic to sway him from his good and pious life in the hopes of exerting control over the town.The reeve was a good man, a pious man, well-liked and respected who had little trouble convincing others of this truth. The poor widow died screaming her innocence for all to hear but none paid heed. Of course, where there is one witch there is bound to be others. A neighbors garden was doing well, while yours withers? Witchcraft! The man whose wife you covet has been seen out in the moonlight being suspicious? Witchcraft! The miller accuses the farmer's wife because she missed mass one day, not because her husband got the best of him on a fee. On and on it goes until amid all the burnings, hangings, and drownings ever soul of the village is damned. Either because they didn't speak up or because they used the paranoia to their advantage. Which is quite a shame when embers from a burning ignite the thatch roof of the cities grain silo leaving many to starve when winter comes. If you listened to Ix this story revealed the true nature of humanity and he should know, he was the one who gave the reeve that last drink.Serving drinks was just the business The Prince of Hell was about when Amaya returned. Laying a fresh round of tankards on the table of a group of rough looking men. Giving them a wink as he tells them that there wasn't to be any fighting in his establishment, however, the rival group was getting to go out the back... This was forgotten as he spots his daughter and, making his excuses, he bounds towards her. \"Amaya!\" He exclaims happily the frustration of earlier in the day forgotten as he sweeps her into another hug. \"I was beginning to think you'd not be coming back tonight. Come I have dinner prepared for you in the back room!\" Without giving her the chance to reply he is urging her through the crowded floor and into the peace and calm of the private dining rooms in the back.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "There was a story that Ix had once told Amaya to try and convince her that humanity was not worth saving. It was one of his favorites, though she'd hated it, because it represented the worst of man. The story goes like this: The village reeve sits in the local inn having had a bit too much to drink. He was a good reeve, well-liked and respected considered to be a good and pious man by all. However, he was prone to a lustful nature when he imbibed drink and that night when the bartender offered him one more round the reeve accepted, despite knowing he had already consumed too much."}, "post-86381": {"user": "Amaya Thundra", "user_num": 3054, "timestamp": "1541135074000", "message": "Amaya was startled from her observations of the denizens busy tavern by her father's sudden embrace. \"Oh, sorry Papa.
