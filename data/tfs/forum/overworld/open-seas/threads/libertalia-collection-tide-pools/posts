Father and daughter sat on wooden stools in a small workshop on the pier, shutters open to let in the cool seabreeze on that hot day. Gaal was the greatest netter anyone had ever seen, and he worked hard at his job. Most impressive still was how such a small old man would come to acquire so much wisdom. People always seemed to forget that Gaal was once a sailor, when he was a strong, young man. When Noma wasn't running an odd-job, or out at sea on some strange quest, she was here, at home, taking care of her aging father, and helping him make nets. Gaal often boasted that she was better at it than he was. It was simple, really. Her hands were slim and small, which meant she could make quick work of knotting the thin threads, whereas his much larger hands were rough, and calloused, making slower work of the silk. \"Do you hear that,\" Gaal said. Noma, somewhere far-away, came back from the depths of her imagination. \"Hear what?\" She turned her head to the side, listening. \"It's just the wind, daddy,\" she said, going back to her work. But Gaal persisted. \"I may be old, but I am far from senile,\" he spoke, sounding hurt. Noma sighed, \"You know how it likes to play tricks.\" Gaal chuckled. \"Oh, I believe I know a whistle when I hear one. Have I ever told you about your mother?\" Something about the wistful and nostalgic look in his eye as he looked out the window drew Noma's attention. \"Many times, daddy,\" Noma stood and went to the window with the intention of closing it, but froze as she heard sharp whistle. It wasn't that she heard it that made her heart nearly skip a beat, it was how it went right through her, as if it was calling her very soul. What happened next was something she could not fight. \"There it is again,\" Gaal said, following Noma as she went about the room, gathering her things. \"I'll be back,\" She went to her father and kissed him on the forehead. \"Your mother was a whistler, you know. Be careful!\" Gaal laughed heartily with a cough. \"I remember too well, not being able to resist the call...I was--.\" But Noma was already gone.She hurried to the edge of the pier, quickly taking the steps down to the beach, then ran along the foreshore as the whistling grew louder and louder, until she ended up at a small collection of tide pools. Leaned over, hands to knees, she caught her breath before taking in the familiar scene, having been here many times before. Noma often came here as a child, catching all sorts of things living or trapped in the pools, or just to take a refreshing dip on an especially hot day. This was also where many little kids learned how to become comfortable swimming in the sea. Most kids would eventually outgrow the pools and ventured outwards, into the ocean. Even so, there was something different there this time. Noma squinted, hand over her eyes to shade them from the sun to better make out what it could be. A dark skinned figure hung over the far-side of one of the pools. Rosy cheeks from the run became even redder as she realized it was a naked woman, and she had just been staring at her for quite some time. \"Oh, my Gods! I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to stare, I was just. Looking! I mean, not what I meant. I was, uhhh, searching for something. Yeah, that's it. It doesn't sound true, but it's really true! Sailor's honor! Hahahaha.\" Noma giggled, a defense mechanism from being put in such an awkward situation with a stunning creature.

Her eyes danced with her movements, feeling the magic spark around them as the water rose and began to form around her.Then, there was Sola. That humming from before- she put it in the back of her mind she never entirely ignored it- she knew where it was coming from now. She turned her head to gaze at him intently, noting that his movements were not so dramatic, but still had a wealth of power behind it. The bubble consumed her lower half, and before she spoke her thanks, the jacket was tossed at her.Holding it to her, the nereid smiled. She'd never met one like him before.His secret was safe with her.She turned to address Noma, her teeth showing as she grinned. \"I don't know how long it's been since I've been able to explore dry land!\" she exclaimed, testing a few steps here and there. She remembered how to walk, as she could do so atop water quickly, but it had been so many years since she'd felt the gravity of the air around her, pulling her into the dirt just below.

Best friends didn't keep such secrets from each other!\u00a0Which could only mean that he didn't consider them to be.Sharing such things meant a certain level of trust, which only she thought them to have had. The painful revelation nearly left her reeling, but she pushed the feelings of betrayal aside and focused, for the sake of the nereid. At least Sola was finally doing something, as she was somewhat relieved to no longer have to make decisions in a situation she knew absolutely nothing about, unlike them. Her father had a lifetime of experience with all sort of creatures during the time he was a sailor; maybe he could help them figure out what to do. Wiping away the sour expression with a firm blink, she grinned back at the happy nereid. It was nearly impossible to stay mad around such a beautiful creature.

He was scarred and not thinking straight. He had used magic he hadn't used in years and spoken a language that he'd tried to forget for even longer. The neriad certainly knew who he was, and he was sure Noma would have questions. And of course the damn bident had started acting up, the hum audible even as he clamped his hand down onto it.
