After the storm, we were left with nothing. Daddy re-erected everything from the wreckage of the Ocean Queen with his own two hands. My brothers helped, too, but I was too young to remember most of it.\" Hardworking hands put this structure together, that much was clear. The timeless timber frame construction spoke for itself, as did the hand-split cedar shingle tiled roof.  The back was open to the calm sea behind the pier,  where Gaal sold boats. \"This way,\" she whispered, peeking in through the windows of the shop. Noma snuck Sola and Dione in through there, and into organized chaos. \"Sorry about the mess,\" she smiled. With the way the walls were covered in tools and equipment of the trade, it was a mariner's dream. Ol' Gaal was outside bargaining with someone about the goods, and Noma was able to quietly guide her friends up the stairs and into the place which they called home. \"Home sweet home,\" she said. The door to the second-story porch outside was wide open, and Noma rushed to close it as quietly as possible, to not alert her father of their presence, then looked to Dione. \"I'll put on a bath for you. Would that make you more comfortable?\" Shelves decorated with memorabilia and tapestries lined the walls, bringing the room to life. A warm and comfortably cushioned cot was placed at the end of the living space, next to a rocking chair, and wine boxes stacked together to act as a nightstand for an old lantern.  Before the cot was a wooden chest that was their coffee table and storage. A ladder against the near wall to the stairs led to a hidden nook close to the ceiling, where Noma slept. Having once been scrapped from the ship's old kitchen, a skinny island table with stools was the only thing separating the cooking area from the living space. Old barrels in the kitchen filled with dried fish, potatoes, cheese, and freshwater. There was a bathtub barrel pushed against the corner on the far side of the room, halfway hidden by a curtain and rod, which Noma had magicked to be filled with fresh water from the other barrels. The family was hardly the epitome of wealth, but it was as clean as a whistle.

She crossed her arms and buried her head in them, then looked to the side at the Hawk, which was perched by the window, cleaning its claws of what she assumed to have been breakfast. Noma hadn't gone up for lunch, not even to check on her guests. A family friend had come to eat with them, and brought them fresh shrimp and delicious baked goods.

Gaal wondered how he could get her to tell him what the trouble was, but there were only so many times he could handle being brushed off by his only family. Then there was the matter of that noise upstairs from before. His hearing was going bad as he aged, but he was hardly a fool. Gaal was once a young man with secrets his parents would never come to know about, secrets he was still taking to grave. He tried not to worry. Afterall, Noma was different from him in his blackhearted youth. She would come to him in time, as she always did. Right? They paused as the ground began to tremble, then the tables, and everything else. Objects fell over, equipment knocked from the walls. \"What's happening,\" Noma jumped up from her place behind the counter, the chair falling over. \"Under the counter, Princess,\" ordered Gaal, old instincts from his days of adventure kicking into his system. The danger lurked near. As Noma did as she was told, the old man's hands reached for a harpoon that hung had been hung from the ceiling like a prize. \"Daddy?!\"\u00a0\"Get upstairs!\" He yelled as tentacles burst through the planks, whipping around, knocking things over and down. \"Quickly!\" Noma froze as realization dawned on her face.

Just remember who's in charge, eh?\" With that she smiles, winks, and heads off, following Iron Bill up the beach as he walks back towards the city. in front of him rolls a short, perpetual wave, suspending Dione as it rolls forward. Every drop from the wave seems to rejoin it at the base like some sort of cycle. Bill knew he could just carry her, but he also knew the importance of water to a Nereid, much like himself. So the creature's name is Dione, and there's one more of those things out there? Curious. \"Alaris,\" she says as she looks to her first mate. \"Notify Desdemona and her crew. If there's a monster cutting about in my waters, I want her lads on it. Let them know I'll send them Iron Bill once he's finished his duties here.\" If there's any crew that can take on a monster, it's Libertalia's own crew or monsters. As Alaris nods and runs off towards the city, quick as a rabbit and about twice as graceful, Johnnie turns her attention to the Dwarven Quartermaster, her second hand. \"One last thing, make sure those who fought that thing are rewarded,\" she says. \"Use my personal treasury. They fought to protect our island, fixing 'em up is only just.\" \"Aye ma'am,\" the stout dwarf nods as he tucks into his pack and pulls out a book and quill. \"I'll meet y' back at the manor. Not t' worry, I won't empty the coffers completely.\" As Johnnie heads off to rejoin the metal monster of a man, the Dwarf looks back to the crowd at the docks. \"Right! All you fighters, listen here!\" He bellows mightily. \"For your service t' the black flag and our island, you're t' be rewarded! Gather round and I'll get yer names!\" He points directly towards Sola, then to Noma, singling them out, even if Noma is down the count. \"Startin' wi' you two.\" Why? They seemed to do the most, of course!

The woman had called out to her by name. She had told her to let go before the magic depleted her life, as Noma was still too weak to be using such magic. Who was she? How did she know Noma? Walking along the coast seemed like the only way to clear her head. Her affairs didn't seem to matter much when she considered such a thing as the Ocean. They looked as insignificant as a grain of sand soon to be washed away by the uncaring Sea. Noma held a pocket of sand in the palm of her hand, watching it fall from her fingers. What did one tiny granule mean to the endless vastness of the Sea?The urge to leave was sudden and powerful. A yearning deep inside that had grown from a whisper into a shout in just three days. Noma never felt so uncomfortable in her body, in her head, in that town. She had a tremendous distaste towards herself and everything she had believed to be real, never having felt so much like nothing so thoroughly. Something told her she would find herself out there. All those years of thinking she had to stay for her father's sake, that they needed to look after one another. After all, they're all they had left. But now, perhaps it was time to say goodbye. Noma dejectedly dragged herself back to the workshop, which looked like new with all the fresh paint and repairs. The town had rallied together to help them rebuild. All sorts of townspeople had come to buy all of their wares as word of the events spread. At least they wouldn't have to worry about money for a while. As she made her way inside, she noticed a package sitting on the counter, feeling glum as she recognized the perfectly neat handwriting addressing her. Noma opened the package.

She trembled in every limb as she felt its power coursing through her body, and all of a sudden, she was connected.

She felt the waves rolling and crashing as the swells swept the shoreline and the currents that ripped through them like rivers rushing out to sea. Most astonishing of all, she felt it all from within, like the beating of her heart--like the very blood that ran through her veins. Fearing she might lose herself to a deeper part of which she was unprepared, Noma set the stone down and took a deep breath. That was when she took notice of the note. I'm sorry, it said in black ink. It was smudged, although not because he had been in any hurry. Noma placed the note back down on the counter with a sigh and rubbed her temples. She felt for him, but what he had done was cruel, and wrong. There were plenty of ways to get the point across without resorting to such humiliating tactics. All things had a breaking point, hearts included. Noma couldn't go through that again. There was no going back to how things were, as much as she wished for that to be a lie. Things were different, now. She was different. She'd rather break her own heart missing him than risk anything like that happening again. It took all of Noma ten minutes to pack, as she didn't have much. All the while she wondered and worried over how her father would react to the lengthy heartfelt letter she was leaving him, along with the Siren's Eye. It had taken her days to write, but she knew he would never let her go if she told him what her plans were to his face.
