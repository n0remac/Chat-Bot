Dark and shrouded in mist, the coastal marshy wetlands are cut with canals that extend inland.

The veritable spider's web of canals and narrow waterways coalesce at one central point; a dark, smelly, tar and mud-filled hole that gave The Dismal Swamp its name.

They were now clad in mud-covered ill-fitting armor, and carried weapons made of actual metal! This was not all. The influx of raw material had set in motion the inventive and resourceful minds of some of the boys, and they'd begun to use their loot in ways one might not immediately think of.The boys had fanned out from the hole they'd dug, and it seemed as if they might have gotten bored and wandered away until a screeching could be heard from only a few dozen meters from the hole. It was the grunting, wailing scream of one of the few animals hearty enough to live in the swamp; a vicious boar-like animal the Splitkulls had affectionately dubbed 'gruntas'.In just a few short moments, the boar came tearing out of the trees near the hole with the Splitkull boy in hot pursuit behind it, all the while letting out its ear-piercing wail as the boy shouted and cursed behind it. The grunta, not seeing the hole, was chased right into the trap, and tumbled to the bottom. The boy, without missing a beat, grabbed up several of the thick armor plates, and jumped into the hole with the trapped beast.The two, the Ork and the boar, fought.
