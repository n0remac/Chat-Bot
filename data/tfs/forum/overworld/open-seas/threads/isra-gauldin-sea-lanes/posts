For without its trade, The Free States would still be The Free City, and the world would be worse off for it. However, due to the wildly successful efforts of Empress Naoki , and her careful management of Isra\u2019s economy, we have the pleasure of living in the world we do today. Through her liaisons with other heads of state, she has forged numerous trade pacts and opened many paths for commerce and all that is associated with it, to flow through.This thread represents the stretch of ocean between The Isran Empire   and The Kingdom of Gauldin   where trade vessels from both nations pass to and fro. For its part, Gauldin contributes a number of airships in addition to the standard merchant galleys to facilitate trade between the two allied nations. All licensed trade vessels travel in convoys, usually comprised of at least six or seven standard merchant vessels, and an airship or two. Though Isra's navy is still in its infancy, Gauldin's Royal Air and Merchant Sea often patrol the sea lanes, both to protect their merchants and perform training exercises out in open waters. Between the convoy formations, Gauldin's patrols, and the careful watch of\u00a0@oceanqueen   in alliance forged between the three parties, any who might wish to disrupt Isra - Gauldin trade may be in for something of a fight.", "link_list": ["https://uvar.deviantart.com/art/Breeze-79637191", "/user/607", "/user/1310", "/user/882"], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/Qi0Z2dQ.jpg"], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://uvar.deviantart.com/art/Breeze-79637191\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Breeze by uvar\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Qi0Z2dQ.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/></a></div>"}, "post-35259": {"user": "Task Force Commandant Viddik", "user_num": 976, "timestamp": "1461808636000", "message": "The scout ship fly high above a cargo vessel traveling the lane.

More specifically the ones that were attempting to cause him to fall from the sky.As he lost about a fifth of his altitude height from the magi efforts, luckily for him, he was not a smiple craft with fixed wings. He combated this by forcefully backpedaling with his wings to move horizontally in circles, slowing his decent, rather than trying to stay hovering with the vertical lift. He would quickly begin casting a large field of antimagic, being specifically able to envelope all of the fleet even as they moved  to any different positioning or formation. As always however, he too and his immediate area  was affected by the antimagic and stopped him from casting anything or the enchantments on his own armor from working. He would nullify the magi's hard work of charging, (unknowingly to himself) removed the scrying and prevented the crystals from activating whatever magical effects they were made for. His positioning changed to shadow over the Freedom (rightmost/rear frigate) and use much longer, wider wing beats to keep his newer height of 400 meters above that ship as he cautiously awaited a reaction.", "link_list": ["/post/53362/thread", "/user/1633", "/user/102", "/user/102", "/user/102"], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/VXjIBjr.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@isranavy\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/53362/thread\" timestamp=\"1476305405\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-1633\" title=\"Isra - Navy\"><img alt=\"Isra - Navy Avatar\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/VXjIBjr.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/53362/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1476305405000\" title=\"Oct 12, 2016 12:50:05 GMT -8\">Oct 12, 2016 12:50:05 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-1633 group-0\" href=\"/user/1633\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@isranavy\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Isra - Navy</span></a></span> said:</div>By now the off-duty mages had been brought on deck, the siege weapons had been loaded, and the squadron was ready for battle.

The vessel's solitary mage, meanwhile, had begun to channel the arcane, gathering its flows in preparation.<br/><br/>The foremost vessel in that line, INS <i>Vengeance</i>, hauled in some sail to reduce speed while adjusting their course a few points to port. This would quickly have the effect of bringing her out almost beside but just a bit ahead of her sister ship, beginning to shift the squadron's formation from the typical straight line of battle to a more unconventional line with the three of them almost abreast, a few ship-lengths between each of them -- enough to leave no chance of lines or sails entangling, much less an actual collision.

This slowed the squadron as a whole while maintaining the flagship's position, allowing the other two ships to bring the squadron into the desired formation. Similarly to the other ships of the squadron, her mages had by now been brought on deck, and now began to gather their power in the same way as the other mages in the squadron. Unlike the other duty mages, however, the duty mage onboard <i>Justice</i> kept gathering his power, refusing to expend it just yet.<br/><br/>The rearmost vessel, INS <i>Freedom</i>, kept all her sail out, shifting her course a few points to starboard to bring her into position opposite <i>Vengeance</i>, with the flagship between them. As with her sister ships, the off-duty mages had been brought on deck and were now channeling their power, gathering the threads of the arcane that they might soon weave a wonderful tapestry of violence.

Meanwhile the mages went right back to charging their power, weaving spells that would remain, for now, mysterious -- though the two drawing air from his wings were of course quite obvious.While Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui's decent was ultimately unpreventable initially, he had done his best to negate some of it with his horizontal movement, while also giving the ships' gunners a false lead on their target, even before the anti-magic was applied. When the order to fire was directed to the springald crews, he would cease his horizontal movement and tuck his wings in closer to his torso, using the magi's suction to pull him down into a dive and accelerate at an extremely higher speed than if he were normally falling, effectively turning their own spell into his own evasive maneuver. Now that he had gained momentum and was now already rapidly moving downwards faster than he normally ever could, he finished his anti-magic while the springald bolts were mid-air, just out of the ships' hulls. The entire immediate area around all the ships and himself would have the magic cease to exist, the bolts no longer had their effects (except the Bolts of Force, they had already gained speed from their spells,) Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui's armor enchantments no longer functioned, the magi would lose their charges, the vacuum of air from his wings would stop, and the Freedom's curved trajectories would meet a tragic end, only curving a partially before sailing off into the sky (far from their target) and eventually arcing down into the deep ocean.With his downward speed and momentum still gathered from the previous suction force, he'd let himself quickly dive low beneath the main barrage with the magi's help before unfolding his wings again and stopping himself midair. Multiple shots of the ship's combined barrage would strike him, mainly on his lower back, tail, and wings. One of the few connecting bolts managed to hit Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui while he was slowing his fall, but it was in the lower left membrane part of his left wing. The standard bolt would obviously penetrate and rip right through the soft flesh, tearing a small hole and causing the dragon some minor pain, but did not interfere with his flying. Three other shots would connect, although less inhibiting than the first. One would penetrate his armor and scales right above his tail, but slightly off center to his right, blood dripped from where the shaft was sticking out, but ultimately seemed to not disturb the dragon. Another connected with the horns following his spine, but it bounced off and collided with an armor plate. The plate tore off and flew down into the blue ocean along with the twirling projectile that ricocheted. The fourth and final impact was one of the bolts that received the velocity increase, yielding mildly better penetration. It grazed the side of Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui's back right leg, tearing away scale and hide as it zoomed past. As far as bleeding damage went, this created the most from all of the other connections, but would not prove to be fatal, for no major artery or vein had been torn, and his leg could still be used effectively, for no severe muscle damage had been done.On the bad side, his descending dodge placed his figure dead center of the Vengeance's and the Justice's firing angles. On the good side, the all ships (excluding the schooners, of course) would be busy with reloading while they were given this steady shot.During the frigates' springalds' relatively long rearming time, Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui's heading would change, wings flapping straight for the lonesome Sandpiper. His altitude would steadily decline towards the schooner's bridge and he flew quickly, but not so fast as to overly fatigue himself or not be able to stop himself within a reasonable distance. He braced for an oncoming barrage, angling his armor and hide to maximize the number of ricochets. Then hopefully the next impact would be his own strike from his muscular limbs' bladed claws' flurry of rending upon the ship's fragile wood hull.(Anti-magic in effect upon all entities, characters and NPCs, allied or enemy, essentially the whole scene.

Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui was surprised to find that the crew thought he was that arrogant, or they were that brave. He noticed the timely arrival of Gauldish airships, and would need to change his plan. Rather than charging head on into a sea of pikes and bolts while leaving himself vulnerable to aerial assault, he\u2019d go under instead of through. By reverse pushing his wings to propel him downwards just a short distance before he came upon the ship and they opened fire, would submerge him with a giant white plume of displaced water shooting up where he went under. The incoming barrage would collide with the dragon, two of them tearing much larger holes in his wings, one impaling the flesh near the base of his front shoulder, the fourth could not fine a square location to impact, and thus, only bounced off of the scale on his side. While Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui\u2019s race of dragon was not known for excellent swimming, but he was decent and could hold his breath for quite a long time, moving through the water was similar as to one flying in air. His serpentine and aerodynamic figure also assisted with navigating through the body of water. When he impacted the water\u2019s surface, he dived down to where the silhouette of his figure nearly disappeared then swam directly under the schooner\u2019s hull, following it if it moved. If somehow the Gauldish airships had taken shots with their ballistae at Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui while he was above or below the water, either their leading would likely hit the Isranian ships now that Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui was under them, resulting in a very complicated inter-national friendly-fire affair, or would lose some of their penetrating power, accuracy and velocity after hitting the ocean\u2019s surface. Once below the small ship, he swam upwards at it, but not crashing into it or breaking the surface. Instead, with good timing he fully arched his body back down to the ocean floor, bending his spine to rear it\u2019s hardened horns. The spikes of his spine would strike the ship\u2019s hull from below, just as a serrated saw slices wood. However, rather than slicing, it was likely just to slowly tear wood piece by piece away from the bottom and cause flooding to the lower deck, and also the upper deck would be rattled as each individual sharpened horn banged and tore against the underside, possibly throwing men off deck and having loose ammo and equipment that weren\u2019t tied or nailed down to slide about. If the wood weren't to break, the bottom of the ship would drag with his horns and began to roll the ship over, possibly pouring the crew and weapons into the sea and/or capsizing it if the flooding was decent. At the end of Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui\u2019s arc, it would take him down to the depths of the sea where he could disappear and then hopefully escape by swimming away from the fight. There were too many to handle now, there was a relatively small trail of blood following behind his path as he swam, and he'd soon likely be needed else where.", "link_list": ["/post/56034/thread", "/user/1585", "/user/102", "/post/56870/thread", "/user/1633", "/user/102", "/user/102", "/user/102", "/user/102", "/user/102", "/user/102"], "image_list": ["http://imgur.com/VAZstL0.jpg", "http://i.imgur.com/VXjIBjr.jpg"], "html": "<div author=\"@muratlafayette\" class=\"quote\" source=\"/post/56034/thread\" timestamp=\"1479333337\"><div class=\"quote_body\"><div class=\"quote_avatar_container\"><div class=\"avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-1585\" title=\"Commandant Murat Lafayette\"><img alt=\"Commandant Murat Lafayette Avatar\" src=\"http://imgur.com/VAZstL0.jpg\"/></div></div><div class=\"quote_header\"><a href=\"/post/56034/thread\"><abbr class=\"o-timestamp time\" data-timestamp=\"1479333337000\" title=\"Nov 16, 2016 13:55:37 GMT -8\">Nov 16, 2016 13:55:37 GMT -8</abbr></a> <span itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><a class=\"user-link js-user-link user-1585 group-0\" href=\"/user/1585\" itemprop=\"url\" title=\"@muratlafayette\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Commandant Murat Lafayette</span></a></span> said:</div>(Enter the scene: 4 Gauldish Airships at 1k points each, defended by 100 pegasus knights at 15pts each.)<br><br/>Commandant Lafayette Murat was grateful to the storm dragon. The scaly Goraian bastard had made a big mistake in threatening Gauldish shipping, and it was his job, nay his happy privilege, to beat that mistake into his tiny noggin. <br/><br/>The four massive airships, approximately the size of seafaring galleons, lumbered their way towards the ongoing fight. Swarming around the u-formation of ships was one hundred pegasus knights, ready to defend any encroachment towards the ships with their razor sharp lances and dashing bravado. They would close on Jark, not allowing him any freedom into the sky as they inverted their u-formation to surround him, showering him with steel-tipped ballista bolts. The bolts would be given extra speed thanks to their downward trajectory, more than enough to penetrate dragon scale and hide.<br/><br/>If Jark decided to go for the airships, if he got within 150ft he would be swarmed from all sides by lance wielding pegasus knights. They make no obvious show of this, instead flying around the ships in random patterns and only beginning to coalesce into a unit when he is within 200ft.<div class=\"quote_clear\"></div></br></div></div>"}, "post-57277": {"user": "Commandant Murat Lafayette", "user_num": 1585, "timestamp": "1480705291000", "message": "The lead Gauldish airship was unable to turn itself in time to avoid a collision with the water.

A call went out for reinforcements from Task Force Commandant Viddik to help deal with what the mages described as a \"bullshit anti-magic field\" that should not be as large as it was. Good news was that since the field was only being actively channelled and not actively charged, it wasn't very powerful.

Him pulling it over was dramatically unlikely even in such an event -- a purely aquatic dragon could likely have done so, but as noted above storm dragons were, while capable of swimming, much less at home in the water. Thankfully all that was irrelevant, as those spines did not catch but rather clanged off of the copper-sheathed hull with only some of them rending the metal coating to gouge and rend the timbers beneath.Those rents in the hull were not massive -- the dragon had been left with little time or space to accelerate after entering the water so near Sandpiper. Nevertheless they existed, and the ship was taking on some water. The ship's carpenter, assisted by several other crewmen, set to work plugged and then patching the hull. While a breach to the bottom of the vessel was unusual, breaches below the waterline were common enough -- especially in the scouting schooners, who were the most likely ships in the Navy to strike submerged rocks or wrecks -- that repairing the damage would be a relatively routine affair (though one with some pressure). Of course the damage to the copper sheathing would remain until the ship reached port, and thus fouling would gradually cause increased drag and reduce some of the fleet mobility that the vessel's construction and rigging allowed it.Vengeance, Justice, and Freedom meanwhile set to attempting to follow the trail of blood Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui   had left as he fled. The shifting nature of the oceanic waters made it impossible to track very far, however, and they shortly gave up to return and assist Sandpiper in her repairs. The Commandant commanding the squadron gave a wave to their Gauldish allies before going belowdecks. A few minutes later a Lieutenant had been selected and sent in the direction of that floating Gauldish ship, assuming it hadn't become airborne again.
