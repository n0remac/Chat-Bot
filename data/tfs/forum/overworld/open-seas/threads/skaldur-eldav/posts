Its works are often said to be unrivaled by any of the other cities, and anybody worth one's salt has an item made in its forges. However this brilliance hides a dark reality. The ores which supply these forges are extracted from the treacherous caves and mines branching off of the city's lower levels, and those who enter never know whether they'll come back or not. So perilous are these caves that the inhabitants have long resolved to stay away from these caves, and so now its only slaves, most of whom are imported, who ever enter the caves to work.Eldav\u00e9l is located entirely underground, within a large cavern which slopes down on the southern side. The only way in and out of the city is through a lengthy tunnel closed off with a gate. A majority of the city is located along the floor of the cavern, with a keep built higher up into the walls where the more important offices are located. Along the southern sloop are where the slaves live, and at the bottom of the slopes are the entrances to the caves.The gate one would encounter when first approaching the city is a rather formidable thing, two large iron doors crafted with meticulous detail and inlaid with gold and silver. A small walkway along the top allows a pair of guards to keep watch for visitors. A lengthy tunnel flows from here until it emerges into the eastern portion of the city.The majority of the city consists of stone buildings, a great many of which are the forges which make it famous. Not far from the entrance there is a semi-permanent market, where a great number of traders will regularly sell goods, and a bit further out are the plentiful mushroom farms.Within the northern wall is the keep, above all else in the city and only accessible to a stairway barely six people wide. Within there the city offices are located, and much like Hafnarh\u00f6fn this is where you might find yourself if you have some rather official business or if you have caused some rather serious ruckus.The southern part of the city is walled off from the rest, with a series of gates allowing access in and out. Beyond this wall are the stone barracks of the slaves and the occasional building for an overseer or storage of ores. To the far west side of this section is a small space crowded with various stones, each chiseled with a name which remains perfectly readable. These stones are far too plentiful to count, and serve as an eerie reminder of the dangers of the caves, among other things.Playable Locations  -  Gate: Where one enters and leaves Eldav\u00e9l. It is not a requirement to post here unless you are bringing an armed force or you are acting in a way that would warrant due suspicion.  -  Streets: The general streets of the city, includes the shops, inns, residencies, and forges  -  Market: Where one would go to find something the city has difficulty providing itself or to simply converse with some friends. The social and economic hub of the city, if only unofficially.  -  Keep: The place in which major transactions and business deals are carried out, as well as where one can wind up if they cause any unwarranted trouble.  -  Slaveyards: Where the slaves reside and the area immediately before the caves  -  Caves: The expansive caves and mine tunnels that branch off of the city. Precious ores reside within, but so do monsters and an untold number of secrets and mysteries.As per rule 2, please note at the top of your post which sublocation you are RPing in if you choose to come here.Link to informational thread", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/3388/skaldur?page=1#post-87934"], "image_list": [], "html": "<div align=\"center\">Eldav\u00e9l</div>"}, "post-90995": {"user": "\u00cdskaldur", "user_num": 2925, "timestamp": "1559716371000", "message": "[Eldav\u00e9l Streets]Their arrival to Eldav\u00e9l was marked clearly by the large gate through which they passed, and it gave a glimpse of what the rest of the city must have in store. The gates stood as a testament to the craftsmen of the city, ornately wrought with eye catching detail. However the sled didn\u2019t slow and the gates were soon behind them, leaving them in an ordinary tunnel.After a couple more minutes of travel the tunnel would open up into a much larger cavern filled with the city itself. Stone buildings of a mostly uniform height filled the cavern floor, with the only notable exceptions being the one built into the northern wall. In all the streets and alleys that lay between the buildings people flitted back and forth, following their daily routine and carrying with them a variety of goods.Vandin would take them a little further south before bringing the sled to a halt and climbing off. \u201cWell, we\u2019re just about here. A little further down are the workyards, and from there the caves where the ruins are.\u201d", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "[Eldav\u00e9l Streets]"}}
