It is here that most national business is conducted and where the major decisions are made that affect the daily lives of all those that call it home.More importantly, it is also the home of Captain Joanne \u201cJohnnie\u201d O\u2019Malley, the leader of the island paradise that is Libertalia. The large building overlooks the town below, its front facing south down the main road and towards the docks beyond. It has three stories to it, ending in stout roof, with the majority of the building being built from stone. It features tall windows on every level, and above the grand double doors and the steps leading up to it, stands a grand balcony. The building itself seems to be built from three buildings, a central section, and two flanking, more square-like structures, not uncommon of colonial buildings of the time it was built. The back of the building is rarely seen to the public eye, nestled in among the cliffs that make up the foothills of Libertalia\u2019s central mountainous regions, where the fauna and a large waterfall cascades down into a beautiful garden. The waterfall leads into a man made, shallow pool, which drains into one of the island\u2019s many rivers. Most of the garden is visible from most interior rooms, which form an almost horse-shoe around the lush gardens and cliff face. Inside, the building is humble, yet very well decorated. Most finishings are a fine wood, with a long carpet moving through each hallway, but leaving a foot of wood between the carpet and floor. The entry way is likely the most grand, a sizable room that goes from the ground floor, all the way to the top, with a grand staircase sitting in the middle of it. Paintings hang on the walls all around the manor, but the largest is a portrait of Captain Francis O\u2019Malley, hung a the top of the grand stairs before it splits off to continue upwards. On the west side of the building sit the bedchambers, grand and beautifully maintained, the largest of which being the master suite. Each bedchamber has its own balcony which looks out over the jungles and beaches that run down the hills, then out into the ocean, where one can watch the sun set over the horizon. To the eastern side of the building, one would find the O\u2019Malley study, where both captains had and still do spend most of their time, planning, plotting, and thinking about their many options or ideas for the continuation of their island home. This side of the building also has notable rooms such as the library, workshop, and training rooms. The lower floors consist of a dining hall, the kitchen, a reading room, anything anyone could want from a manor fit for a governor or a captain of O\u2019Malley\u2019s stature.

At the manor it's a different tale, however. Iron Bill had safely deposited the Neried into the manor's large, waterfall fed pool, filled with fresh, clean water from deep inside the mountains beyond. Though a guard had been posted, Iron Bill sits under the water's surface, not far from Dione, keeping a silent vigil. The only movement that comes from the armour is a small bubble escaping it's cracks on a rare occasion. As night turns back into day, the warm tropical sun rises over the island, first streaking through the dense palms, then it bathes the large pool and patio with its warm glow, perfect for a swim, or in the captain's case, working on her tan. Just outside the pool, she lays on a lounge, wearing little more than a wrap around her chest and rolled up pants, basking her toned, scarred, and tattooed body in the sun's glow. Even her dark blonde hair is set free from its usual ponytail and bandana. Not far, Fontaine does the same, but she seems to be reading a large tome, while the captain appears to possibly be napping, considering her arm is over her closed eyes. The sun streaks through the pool's water, raising the temperature ever so slightly. Iron Bill doesn't seem to mind at all as his glowing faceplate continues to watch over Dione. Though the Captain had thought about it, she decided against any chains or restraints for the Nereid, partly due to her values, but also because of Bill's insistence that she wasn't like the others.

They do not sing, but they're smart. If they want to badly enough, they can learn speech, but most do not pursue it. They're such good hunters they get bored, but they also hate it when anything gets in their space, be it sailors, sharks, or other stalkers; they don't care.

Either way, she remains quiet, even as Iron Bill rises from the water at the far end.The images of Dione's journey cross her mind, imagining such events. Such barbarity on the ocean isn't unheard of, in fact many accuse her of such dealings, but it's usually the Sea Dragon falling into a trap, yet she remains afloat and undefeated. Perhaps some of the dogs she's put down in her time were the crew that killed her? Perhaps her father had sunk them in his journeys? She would have to consult the old log books, where both captains have recorded their wins, and the names of the sunken ships and their captains. The captain let's out a small whistle after Dione finishes, shifting again and laying on her side by the pool, head propped up. \"One hell of a story, Dione,\" she says, eyes not leaving the Nereid's. \"I'll find out if there's truth to it in time, I'm sure, but for now I'm willin' t' believe you.
