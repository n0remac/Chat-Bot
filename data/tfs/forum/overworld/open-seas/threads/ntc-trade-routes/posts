Being a trader means you deal with coin, right?  Who else deals in coin?  House Vinar.  I don't know how, but ever since... well, the ancient days of the Varan, House Vinar has always been the wealthiest clan in Asgeir.  They maintain a vast network of spies and assassins throughout Asgeir, and I've heard rumors there influence extends even in the rest of the Overworld.  They're a... nuisance, sometimes.  Long ago, they used cunning and trickery to usurp whole kingdoms.  When the Cataclysm happened, clan Vinar promised to pay every man and woman who fought for the Thundering Three, and paid them they did.  They may be assholes... but they're patriotic assholes.  They use greed and treachery to get what they want.  But... when Asgeir need's something done, and it requires finances, they turn to the Vinar, who supply us with endless wealth.  They provide us the finances to run an army, to develop our lands, and more.  We need them, despite their dastardly activities.  Does that make sense?  \"It's like a dog who bites you... but you don't put it down because he protects your flock from wolves.  You don't like it, but you need it.\"\"Anyway... when the High King wanted to expand Asgeir's economy, he called upon two men: me, and Vylo.  Vylo provided me with the finances, and I was given the rights to own the NTC due to my experience and ancestral bloodline of being a good damn sailor.\"<We can arrive in TPS whenver you wish.
