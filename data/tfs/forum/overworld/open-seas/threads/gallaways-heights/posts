Named after their discoverer, the courageous Fredrick Gallaway, these islands are notable for their unusual topography. Each one is extremely tall, reaching as high as 1500 feet, and yet are relatively narrow. This leads to a very precarious appearance, and most explorers are hesitant to climb to the top for fear of falling to a horrible and gory death.
