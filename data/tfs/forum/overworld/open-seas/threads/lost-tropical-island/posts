Many who were lying down or throwing up were coming upright, and getting ready. Their leader, Captain Karl looked around. The Dwarves had never dealt with tropics before, and were not sure about how to deal with them now. Still, they would press on.\u00a0<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><div style=\"text-align:center;\">\"Right lads, we don't know what kind of horrors are here, so far the sea has been kind, no serpents, no octopi bigger than our ship, no drakes, and the forests don't look as menacing as the one back in Dolburrim. Still, be on the lookout, be ready for fighting and all. Prime the two swivelling ballistae on the top, load the Dolburrim Flames with the ethanol, don't let old Jovek drink it. Who knows what is waiting for us. Let's just approach the Island, we'll get as close as we can before hitting sand and then drop anchor. Ready der lit' boat, we'll need to go there soon. We'll go to the island after we get close, minimal risks. Alright?\"<br/><br/><br/><br/><div style=\"text-align:justify;\">With that the Dwarf ship plodded as close to the island as it could, their spot of landing on a map of the island would be 90 degrees further clockwise to the west from where the pirates landed. The little boat would begin it's short trip to the island itself, the Dwarves on the boat cheering for them, a little muffled through their masks but nonetheless loud. Sounds of bottles smashing, fencing with bone and tooth cutlasses, and various songs would be the theme of the cacophony they made.\u00a0</div></div></div></div>"}, "post-38579": {"user": "Ray Fletcher", "user_num": 1249, "timestamp": "1463719639000", "message": "\"Aw, come on.

It was past midday now to be sure and most likely venturing into the deep afternoon, but the captain of the Misfortune had never fully grasped how to tell the time solely from where the sun sat in the clouds and he had left his fancy shadow-board that could make such a calculation for him back in his cabin.\u00a0Still... If memory served him correctly... It was definitely around time-to-eat-o'clock, so he shuffled up off his jacket and flicked it from the beach with his foot only to catch it with his limber hands. A large portion of the crew were now set up on the beach away from the tide, with campfires and hammocks and even some open crates filled with fruit set up all along the beach-front where the jungle touched the sand.\u00a0\"Oi! Where's Laila? I t'ought she was suppose' t'be bringin' us some meat?\" He called out, only to receive shrugs in reply from the useless, cursed wastes of space that took up his lower deck. Sighing out loud, he pushed through a bush of tall and wide leaves and dipped his hand into a barrel to pull out a juicy, colourful fruit in order to take a bite out of it.\u00a0\"Laila's gone too? Captain have ya seen Jeremiah and Dylan? They went to go explore a bit a while ago and they still haven' come back,\" a crew member asked while carving something into a piece of wood with a knife.\u00a0\"No, I was nappin',\" Jack replied. \"'sides, isn' Dylan t'guy wit' a snake fer an arm? I doubt any beastie would want t'mess wit' him.\"\u00a0Still, Jack let out a sigh and rolled his eyes. \"Alrigh', I guess I'll keep an eye out an' maybe go take a walk an' see if I can' find 'im. ROMELIA! I'M GOIN' ON A LICKLE WALK, YOU'RE IN CHARGE 'TIL I GET BACK!\"The last part, yelled as it was, seemed to scare a lot of sleeping pirates right out of their hammocks and off their blankets. It made Jack chuckle, before he wandered away from the camp and into the bush.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "(Unfortunately I'm going to have to use my power as setting creator to omit Foxko's post on account of it being incompatible with the island setting; which was specified as \"lost\" and needs to remain so prior to the arrival of the pirates for an active quest that has been pre-planned.
