There was little mourning for crooks and criminals in this world, but her own men, they had families, families she had to answer to when they returned to port, and the fact they were starting to accumulate significant losses twisted her stomach like a knife to the gut. She watched as reinforcements began storming to the deck's edge from the pirate vessel, calling down to their captain with every intent to slaughter the remaining archers they had on deck. She refused to let more die. \"Archers, support crew, full retreat. Starboard side defensive units, form a column, cover their escape! Port side, meet the enemy at the midship line, their captain is mine! They're starting to buckle, we use lull in their reinforcements to salvage our own. Nobody else needs to die today. If they get in close abandon your spears, your swords aren't just for show.\" she called out broad sweeping gestures punctuating her orders. The samurai advance was temporarily quelled by their preoccupation with saving their soldiers, their emphasis now not on killing every scrappy pirate that had flooded onto the deck, but saving the samurai lingering out of position at the front of the boat.\u00a0Their recon ships had starkly limited success when compared to the efforts of the main ship. The pirates had a strong, solid hold on their captive, and the smaller ships feared even attempting to board might provoke their remaining crew into killing off the merchant captain, something which Yamaoka would punish them dearly for. Satsuki's signaler, soaking wet, had given them the orders, but it seemed like they had few options when it came to carrying them out.

She strode forward with firm, even steps, making quick work of another pirate who stood between her and her direct beeline for the marauder commander in question, capturing the poor young lad's axe in the crux of her spear blade and hook, twisting the weapon from his hand before driving her spear shaft through his throat. She made an uncaring step over the fresh corpse and pointed her spear towards the towering, grisly, criminal captain. Though battles raged to either side, there was now nothing that stood between the two of them any longer. The tides of war would be settled by their clashing steel here, in this moment.\u00a0", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Their losses were piling up, and it was quickly becoming clear that bloodshed was far from finished. Granted, she staffed soldiers, their jobs were to lay down their lives for the sake of the cause, but rarely did they get into skirmishes where resistance was this severe. The pirates had sustained losses in far greater numbers than their own, but those boys would hardly be missed, most didn't have families, those that did, probably treated them like an afterthought.
