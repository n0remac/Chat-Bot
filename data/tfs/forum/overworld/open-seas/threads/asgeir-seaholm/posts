As much of Asgeir\u2019s northern coasts are laden with jagged rocks and overhanging cliffs, this settlement serves as the only point of entry into Varan homeland from the north.  As such, virtually all maritime trade coming into and out of Asgeir by sea is focused here.The sailortown nature of Seaholm attracts many seamen, merchants, and other travelers of all kinds.  A panoply of docks built along the shores of the islet host ships burdened with goods from all across the world, most of which are stored in the many warehouses attached to the docks.  A variety of smiths, jewelers, craftsmen, and other artisans reside in Seaholm itself, exploiting the potential to sell their wares to incoming foreigners.  Inns, taverns, and mead halls dot the city streets, offering rest and respite for people of all kinds.  Unique to Seaholm, the Varan here do not extend outward beyond the shores of the islet, but rather upward - with some buildings several stories high.Tall, burly, and capable Varan mercenaries sell their services to the highest bidders on the docks.  These natural-born warriors are renowned seafarers and raiders, and their skills are in high demand for anyone hoping to survive the northern seas.Seaholm may not be entirely walled, but the two rivers surrounding the islet provide a natural barrier for any would-be attacker.  The city\u2019s primary defensive unit is the Seaguard - capable warriors who also excel at naval combat, and some of whom have wind magic.  Various trading companies enlist privately-funded mercenaries to garrison their warehouses, and these additional fighters only aid in the defense of Seaholm.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/NlOGg8S.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/QRVDaXk.jpg"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><b><font size=\"5\"><i>Seaholm</i></font></b></div>"}, "post-87786": {"user": "Y\u00fcbor, the Eye of the Storm", "user_num": 927, "timestamp": "1544909672000", "message": "Y\u00fcbor rested against the railing of the perch as he examined the action below.

Every few years an eternal enemy of the Varan, the Witch of Winter, sent her minions south to assault the northern coasts of the Overworld.  Hordes of pale-skinned frost elves would sack and raze unsuspecting towns and villages, leaving ruin in their wake, before returning back to their arctic wastes.An invitation had been sent to the Taingaardians as well as the East Isran Trading Company  to take part as well.  Ulfr and Y\u00fcbor were both confident that the Varan fleet alone could handle the task, but it would be foolish not to seek aid from two other great naval forces.  The combined fleet would certainly be able to deal a decisive blow to the Witch of Winter and her Frost Elves, thus sparing the lives of man innocents this winter.A bone-chilling gust swept across Seaholm.

By the time Y\u00fcbor\u2019s allies arrived the Varan warriors had boarded the ships and were prepared to disembark.Y\u00fcbor stood on the deck of The Seahag, ready to invite both Arthur and Granor when they attempted to come aboard.  The Varan longships were not unlike the Taingaardians\u2019, although they lacked magical enchantments, and Granor\u2019s flagship - The Herold, was larger than The Seahag.The Isran ships, on the other hand, were quite a sight to see.  They were much larger than any seafaring vessel the Varan were use to, although many of Asgeir\u2019s warriors had encountered such ships during their travels, and even served as mercenaries aboard them.  Y\u00fcbor shared a similar thought as the rest of the Varan: the Isran ships were large, no doubt cumbersome, and not as well-suited to the waters surrounding the northern icelands as the longships.  Nevertheless, he thought, they would make do and bring much-needed strength to the combined fleet.\u201cPermission granted!\u201d Y\u00fcbor extended his arm and enthusiastically welcomed Arthur onto the Seahag.
