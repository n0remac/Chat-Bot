The city itself is mostly self contained inside the cliff it\u2019s built into, a few buildings existing outside to deal with the docking of foreign ships.The docks are relatively plain wooden things, built above a freezing sea and ready to accept any vessels which may arrive. It\u2019s usually pretty empty, most preferring to stay out of the chilling outdoors. Lamps hang at uniform intervals, illuminating most of the dock in their light should the wind be merciful enough to not blow them out.Several wooden structures jut out of the cliff, providing access to the city within as well as serving as a lookouts and places to drive away any unwelcome guests with several large ballistas. The bulk of the city is contained within the cliff and built in several layers. The bottom layers tend to be where most of the business takes place and is a chaotic and disorganized market. The middle layers belong to belong to the various professional shops and services, as well as inns for travellers to reside in. The higher levels contain the permanent residences and offices from which the city is run. The design of the city keeps it insulated and at a tolerable temperature, which is made comfortable by the many bonfires which are located throughout.Playable locations within Hafnarh\u00f6fn:\u00a0- \u00a0Docks: Where one starts in Hafnarh\u00f6fn if traveling by boat. Shady business occasionally occurs in the corners where the light does not reach.\u00a0- \u00a0Streets: Where a majority of the action will take place, includes the markets, shops, inns, and residencies of all the levels.\u00a0- \u00a0Offices: The place in which major transactions and business deals are carried out, as well as where one can wind up if they cause any undue trouble.
