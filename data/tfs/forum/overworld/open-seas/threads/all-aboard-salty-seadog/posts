The ship could have been burning around him and he would not have noticed, so focused was the scholar on his hands and the shield. Completing the circle of runes along the shield's edge the lights flared one last time before simmering. Instantly Hirhan felt a deluge of energy flee from his body.

Sparrow will be given command of the ship and we'll head back to the docks to let the rest of the crew on. This is how we're doing to do things, got it kid?

Isn't a great surprise?!\" Engara responded.\"Are you ready for another great surprise?!\" Engara spoke loudly.That moment, half of the sails went up and the ship would take a sharp right. The wind grabbing the remaining sails would immediately jerk the ship, and then the sharp turn of the wheel, any who weren't prepare would definitely be thrown off balance. To control the movements took a lot of strength and a lot of experience. Maybe someone would even take notice to the move.The sails would drop and Sampson would slap the wheel back into place. Due to the ships tipover-tempting  movement, it would allow Sparrow to be released and Ralf away from Sampson. The only thing unaffected besides Engara and his group would be the illusion if Hirhan didn't break his focus during the jerk.In the meanwhile, this gave Engara the chance to pull all the sands from the satchels Sampson and the men carried. A semi transparent orb of sand spiraled around Engara. The two pirates on the sails held black powder pistols in both of their hands. Two aimed at Ralf and two at Sparrow.\"Never underestimate a pirate. I'll tell you, diplomacy goes a long way sometimes, and threatening Sampson was definitely not the way to go...\" He spoke to Ralf. \"Thank you, sir, for restraining the maniac.\" He spoke to Leiron.\"Now, for everyone here. Even those who hide in the shadows. This ship IS sailing to an island. If you are scared of dragons and fire, jump now while you can swim back. My men WILL control the sails. Sampson will resign from the wheel and serve as your help, taking the wheel when the captain is gone. I have no interest in harming anyone here. I am on a quest to sail, and if I see an empty ship, yes I will set sail in it. We can work together or we can put an end to many lives right now. If we work together, I don't want any monetary treasure found, I just want to map it and say i've been there.\" Engara spoke, having no idea that the others were preparing for the same quest; he understood the other beings positions, but bullying didn't work with his group.
