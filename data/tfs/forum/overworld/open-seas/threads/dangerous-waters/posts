The previously placid sea below churned angrily, and small bolts of energy began leaping from the choppy waves.Daren's boat rocked in the violent waters, the sound of thrashing water filling the air, before quickly being drowned out by a low pitched humming so loud it shook the lonely sailor's bones. The sound reverberated with power, Daren would even be able to feel the sound and it's immensity in his boots as it shook the timber beneath him. Daren would begin to notice the waters around him rising, but upon further inspection he would see that his ship was actually sinking into the waves. It was as if a pit was forming in the ocean itself around his ship - unnoticeable at first but growing deeper quickly. The ship was now surrounded on all sides by walls of water, alight with magical energy and littered with strange symbols Daren has never seen before, flowing across the surfaces of water surrounding him.Soon the boat descended far enough from the surface that only sight of the surface was a small peep-hole of the stars above. All around now was darkness, the blackness of the deep vast ocean being held back only by the strange forces that had entrapped the ship in the first place. There was no moment for reprieve, however, as the guarding light that held back the water, and drew the ship in suddenly vanished and plunged Daren and his ship in complete darkness. He could only hear the sound of vast amounts of water around him, like a great waterfall as the deep hole in the ocean began to collapse.In that very moment Daren would suddenly feel a strong pressure on his mind, seeking to smother his thoughts completely and force him into unconsciousness.-Fade to Black-When Daren finally awoke, he would find himself still in complete darkness. Any belongings he may had had on him except for his clothes were gone and the ocean breeze was no longer present, replaced by an eerily still and chilly atmosphere that would leave him constantly shivering.Beneath his bare feet, he would feel not the familiar wooden deck, but instead a rough stone that affirmed he was now in a place he did not know. As Daren felt around more, he might deduce that the stone beneath him seemed to be some sort of cobble stone, and as he wandered around he would find only stone walls around him. The true realization would come when he felt one particular side of the room, and felt the cold, hard iron bars at his finger tips.

Very quickly he convinced himself that this was his final moment. This was it... the abstract distortion of the roaring sound contained by walls of water sent dread deep into the pit of his stomach, and it only got worse as the ship descended under the ocean. While he was not actually sinking, no part of his mind was reserved for such optimism... at any moment, he fully expected the massive weight of the ocean to collapse upon him. As he descended, the air grew colder and colder, more dank and humid, his ears popping as his body adjusted to a rapidly changing pressure.Because of this, it was a little bit difficult to discern whether his loss of consciousness was due to the sudden atmospheric change, or something else. All he knew was that he was succumbing to darkness... both literally and figuratively. There was no time for anything but a quick surrender to death and the circumstances.So when he awoke, he was a little bit disoriented. Is this.. death?

He didn't feel wet, he didn't begin floating upwards, and he could still somehow breath. As his eyes adjusted to the darkness he would find himself in the courtyard of what seemed to be some sort of ruined castle beneath the sea...\u00a0Where the sky above him should have been, he saw only infinite blackness, lit by what seemed to be gigantic bio-luminescent jellyfish that floated lazily through the dark water above, some of them seemed to exceed twenty meters in length.
