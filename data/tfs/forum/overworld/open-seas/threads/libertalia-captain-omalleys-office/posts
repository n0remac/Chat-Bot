It\u2019s here that Captain O\u2019Malley does her planning, her thinking, and her study. When she\u2019s home, its likely she can be found here. The room itself is very large, and very well lit by four large, tall windows along the eastern side of the manor, and two similar windows on the south side, looking out into the city. Between these two windows sits a desk, facing the other side of the room, grand and hand crafted, and usually covered in scattered notes and books of all sorts. Along most of the free walls are book cases, teeming with books of all shapes and sizes, and between them sit paintings and trophies of all sizes. Monster parts, stuffed animal heads, weapons and flags confiscated from other ships, anything someone would expect from an ex-pirate. At the north end of the room sits a huge fireplace with two leather armchairs facing towards it. Above the mantle is a large portrait of Johnnie O\u2019Malley, standing on the front of a ship, cutlass extended and leading the ship forward. In the middle of the room sits a pair of couches and arm chairs, each as beautiful as the last, intricately designed and each with a leather finish that has aged perfectly, all of which sit on a beautiful carpet that seems to match the darker colours of the painted walls. Many odds and ends are scattered through room. A large globe sits near the desk, a storage unit between the sets of windows on the eastern side, filled with scrolls and clues to mysteries nobody but Johnnie knew, and finally liquor cabinet in the back corner. Though usually people aren\u2019t here to admire the view outside or the intriguing decor inside, no. They\u2019re usually here to speak to the woman behind the desk, Captain Johnnie herself.

On one of the couches, lounging happily in the sun as it comes through the huge windows, lays the first mate Alaris Fontaine, wearing her usual blouse and dark pants combo. She peers up from the book in her lap, one eyebrow raised, but she doesn\u2019t say a word. Then again, she rarely does. At the desk, however, back to the intruder, stands the captain herself, unphased by the doors flinging open. One arm is crossed over her chest, while her free hand sits on her chin as she pours over a series of maps, charts, and books that are strewn over her desk. The captain\u2019s hair is pulled into a messy ponytail, and her signature long coat sits across the back of the chair on the opposite side of her desk. \u201cWe may be an island of free folks,\u201d she said without turning around, her accent almost poetic as she speaks. \u201cBut we still respect the common courtesy o\u2019 knocking, and not bursting past my staff.\u201d She finally turns and leans back against the desk, hands on either side of the edge. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even give Mr. Gibson a chance to take your coat.\u201d \u201cApologies, ma\u2019am,\u201d a voice says from behind the Av\u2019. Its from a tall, well built man, light skinned and wearing a perfectly cut butler\u2019s uniform. His greying hair is neatly cut, and he spots a large handlebar moustache that continues into a set of fine mutton chops that follow a strong jaw. \u201cIt would seem our guest is in quite a hurry. I very nearly had a close up account of my handy-work on the foyer\u2019s floor.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s alright, Mr. Gibson, carry on. I\u2019ll take it from here,\u201d the captain says as she looks to the Av\u2019. The butler nods gracefully and walks away from the office. \u201cFolks always need me, my finely horned friend,\u201d she continues, now addressing the Av\u2019. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong at the tidepools this time? Giant crabs again? I suppose that means crab for dinner, hm Alaris?\u201d The tan skinned elf on the couch nods with a small smirk.

If Iron Bill speaks up from his\u2026 nap?
