It\u2019s unforgiving and filled with a myriad of dangerous beasts. Located throughout this cruel tundra are a number of cities, varying in size and typically centered around a valuable resource or location. There are three settlements of noticeably importance.The city of \u00cdskaldur\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The capital city, sharing its name with the land it controls, is made hospitable by the power of the crystal which resides in its center. The permafrost that envelopes the rest of the land is broken around the city by the growth of various bizarre crops, typically maintained by slaves and farmers. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The city is surrounded by a stout wall that\u2019s a mixture of stone and crystal, and covered with a an ever-present layer of snow and ice. Splitting the walls into quarters are the gates, sturdy things made of wood and reinforced with steel. They typically remain closed, but they stay ready to be opened for the occasional traveller.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The city itself is made up of a mixture of stone buildings and wooden ones, the layout of which grows increasingly disorganized and haphazardly as one nears the center. However it\u2019s not too hard to find a service should one be needed, be it blacksmithing, a little bit of magic service, a place for a traveller to stay for a night, or simply a good drink.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the center of the city, built around the cavern of the crystal, is another wall surrounding an impressive keep. The walls are not dissimilar to those that surround the city, but noticeably taller and thicker. A single gate is present, facing towards the location of Hadnarh\u00f6fn and kept open. The keep is constructed of stone and lies above the cavern. Within the keep is where the governmental business of \u00cdskaldur is conducted.Playable locations within \u00cdskaldur:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Streets: Where a majority of the action will take place, includes the various shops, services, and inns that are located within \u00cdskaldur.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Keep: The place from which \u00cdskaldur is ruled and controlled, also protects the cavern of the crystal. This location is not available without invitation.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 - \u00a0 \u00a0Chamber of the Crystal: A space beneath the Keep which holds the life giving Crystal that is worshipped throughout the land. While natives are allowed in without much issue, the people of \u00cdskaldur are skeptical of non-natives and don\u2019t readily grant them entrance.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As per rule 2, please note at the top of your post which sublocation you are RPing in if you choose to come here.Link to informational thread", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/3388/skaldur?page=1#post-87934"], "image_list": [], "html": "<div align=\"center\">[\u00cdskaldur]<br/></div>"}}
