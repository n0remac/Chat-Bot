{"post-84966": {"user": "Gerald Neumann", "user_num": 2934, "timestamp": "1536543518000", "message": "The Hunt For Al DorandoThe interior of the Tyger was dark and silent, the sun had come and gone, and it swayed gently in the calm, nighttime waters. Gerald had been slumbering peacefully on his cot next to his new, beautiful, woman...if you could call her a woman. She was as much a kitten as she was human. She, too, was sleeping peacefully in the cot.However, an unsettling feeling of dread washed over Gerald and he soon startled awake, as if he had just experienced a nightmare. Perhaps he had. All he knew was he woke up with heavy breaths and a hurried heartbeat. Groggy, he picked at Kuroka\u2019s arms and untangled himself from her grasp, swinging his legs from under hers and over the side of the cot, causing it to sway slightly. The movement didn\u2019t seem to wake the kitten.He sighed tiredly and rubbed both his eyes with the palm of his hand, then peered through the darkness of the crew quarters. Everything was as it should be, cots filled with sleeping sailors and the rare sound of someone\u2019s footsteps above decks. It was a calm night and the ship was crewed by the few night-crewman while the rest slept. Probably even the captain was asleep by this time. As dark as it seemed, it had to have been very late.Unfortunately, the feeling of dread never left Gerald, even now that he was awake. It was a familiar feeling of fear. One he had experienced some time ago. He knew the source, he just wanted it to have been a dream. Soon, a light mist spread through the crew quarters, slowly billowing over everything until Gerald\u2019s line of sight was significantly reduced. He knew, then, that this was exactly what he feared most. \u201cWell, well. I am surprised to find you alive, and well, Gerald Neumann,\u201d came a smooth, sinister, voice from the mist. A dark silhouette stepped forward. It was tall, over six and a half feet tall, and seemingly had broad shoulders. As the being stepped closer, it became clear that those weren\u2019t shoulders, but large wings tucked behind it\u2019s back. Gerald had seen those wings once, unfurled they were several feet long and as awe-inspiring and beautiful as they were intimidating. Right now, they were merely wrapped around the figure like a dark charcoal cloak. His torso was bare, revealing a barreled and muscular chest and a strong trunk. A wide brow sash kept his trousers up, if one could call them that. They started at his waist like thick black fabric and gradually turned into dark tendrils of smoke like a long flowing skirt. On his hip was a large single-edged curved blade with a decoratively curved hilt wrapped in elegant black silk with gold inlay and a small gold pommel cap. The angel-like creature smiled as it watched Gerald\u2019s face twist into one of shock and horror. For such a large, strong, being, its face had very soft features with an angular jaw and small narrow nose and high cheekbones. It was a feminine face, one that could potentially be called \u201cpretty\u201d, and his voice was soft, and smooth, like the silk of his clothing. Yet there was always an underlying maliciousness to it. \u201cI did not expect you to have survived the wreck of The Panther, but I am glad to have found you, my old friend,\u201d he continued with a friendly smile. If Gerald hadn\u2019t known him better, he would have thought it was a sincere one.A sudden realization washed over Gerald as he listened to the words of the being. \u201cAzazel, you bastard!\u201d He hollered, his fear being replaced with rage and hate. He quickly stood up from the cot and took a step towards Azazel, as if he was about to pounce on him in a street fight.Azazel had other plans, and reached forward lazily and poked Gerald right in the chest with his long and slender forefinger. Pain erupted in the area that was touched and quickly spread throughout Gerald's torso. A burning ache like his heart had caught fire. He screamed in agony and fell back down on the cot, clutching his chest and hyperventilating as he tried to fight it. As quick as it had begun, the pain subsided and Gerald was silent as he caught his breath.\u201cYou have been marked for a second time, Gerald Neumann,\u201d Azazel said calmly, but also cruelly. His smile was now gone and had been replaced with a frown. A mixture of both irritation and boredom. \u201cYou know what happens to my servants that are marked for a sixth time.\u201dGerald clawed at his tunic and pulled the collar down to examine his bare chest. Next and slightly under one just like it, was a small, perfectly round, black dot. It could easily have been mistaken for a tattoo, but for anyone who experienced it and where it came from, they knew better. They were those that had signed a contract with the being known as Azazel, and if they didn\u2019t fulfill their side of the contract in a timely matter, were repeatedly marked until the being removed them from the Overworld and brought them to his realm, where they\u2019d serve him for an eternity as his slave. Not a fate Gerald wanted for sure, but he was blinded by lust and greed at the time he signed the contract, some two months ago. He was marked then, and he remembered it being painless. Azazel made this second-time hurt intentionally, probably because Gerald had been belligerent.He stared down the creature with eyes of pure hatred, wishing he had the strength to strike the thing down.\u201cIn one month, I shall return. Please do have made some progress by then, else I\u2019ll sink this ship too and mark that pet of yours.\u201d With that said, Azazel made to move.\u201cW-wait,\u201d Gerald croaked, his throat suddenly dry. \u201cIf I let you mark her,\u201d he began, gesturing to Kuroka laying by his side. \u201cPromise you won't interfere with my quest again.\u201d Gerald immediately felt shame for his suggestion. He was a scoundrel, he knew it, and that made it a little easier to swallow his guilt. If all went to plan, they\u2019d accomplish their quest within the month and Kuroka wouldn\u2019t have a thing in the world to worry about. Yeah, that sounds about right. Done in a month.\u201cLet me? Gerald, you would have no way of stopping me. But, I am in a good mood today after finding out my old friend is alive, and you offering up your pet amuses me greatly. Very well.\u201d The fact that Gerald really didn\u2019t have a right to sacrifice Kuroka\u2019s soul to Azazel didn\u2019t seem to phase the being, who, in a flash of movement, was on top of them, pinning Gerald down with the palm of its hand while the other prodded Kuroka\u2019s upper chest with his finger. Marking her as he did Gerald...and then again, giving her a second mark. She now had the same \u201ctattoos\u201d as Gerald. \u201c...and a second mark for a hint,\u201d Azazel added with a cruel smirk, his eyes shining with malice. \u201cCongratulations, her fate is not intertwined with yours.\u201d He let out a hearty laugh then. \u201cI hope you are proud of yourself.\u201d\u201cYou fuckin\u2019 bastar-\u201d Gerald began, but was soon interrupted by Azazel before he could finish his exclamation.\u201cThe City is south-west of Rondon. Good luck, Gerald Neuman. The seas are violent even without my intervention.\u201d The creature then climbed off the duo and made to leave.\u201cW-wait! That's too vague, I need more, especially at the cost of a mark!\u201d Gerald sat up once again. He was panicking. He had cost Kuroka two marks for almost little in return.\u00a0Azazel shrugged indifferently, obviously bored now. \u201cOne hint, one mark. Just rest assured in the fact you know the City is real with a certainty now no one else in the Overworld has but you. Ta ta.\u201d And with that, a poof of black smoke, dark as the void, erupted from beneath the creature and, in an instant, Azazel was gone from the ship. Without its source, the mist quickly dispersed into nothingness and everything was, eventually, back to normal.Gerald fell back into the cot, overly conscious of the sleeping form next to him, and tried to keep skin contact to a minimum. He was feeling guilty for what he had done, for what he may have condemned Kuroka too, and struggled to sleep for the rest of the night.Come morning, Gerald wasn\u2019t exactly avoiding Kuroka. He merely made sure he was out of bed and above decks before she woke, and at the helm by the Captain, instead of up in the crows nest with her. He feared what her reaction may be when she realizes she woke up with two new \u201ctattoos\u201d she hadn\u2019t fallen asleep with. Sure, there were no mirrors on board, as far as Gerald knew, and changing clothes, for her, wasn\u2019t much of an option with sex-starved sailors on board. But that kimono she wore had somewhat of a low V and all it\u2019d take was her to look down at her ample bosom and see the marks on her chest.It was a beautiful spring morning with the early morning sun casting a lovely and warm orange glow over the water; its reflection rippling gently in the calm waves of the light blue water. Gerald had made sure they were going at a south-east course.With the war between Rondon and Zephyr seemingly at an unofficial ceasefire, privateers like them weren\u2019t making much in the way of money and Gerald was able to convince Captain Walworth to strike out on their own for a bit. At least until the war inevitably started back up.\u201cSo, Cap\u2019n,\u201d Gerald began, leaning lazily on the wheel, having locked it into place while the sea was calm and the winds steady. \u201cWhat do you know about the legend of Al Dorando?\u201d", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["https://i.imgur.com/GzzJ6v4.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/HJsH4yx.png"], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><b><font size=\"6\"><u>The Hunt For Al </u><span><u>Dorando</u></span><br><br/><img alt=\"\" class=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/GzzJ6v4.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/></br></font></b></div>"}, "post-84979": {"user": "Henry Walworth", "user_num": 2931, "timestamp": "1536553247000", "message": "Henry Walworth was actually awake at that hour, though he wished he was otherwise.

Finally, he had turned in to his hammock, softly strumming his mandolin in thought as he swayed with the gentle rocking of the ship. Morning found Walworth directing the rather lazy crew on the finer points of scraping down the ship. Discipline had been lax during their time at port, and he had been forced to already prove one example for disobedience at the end of a cat-o-nine-tails. This sitting in port was doing no one any good. He was leaning on the banister facing the main deck when Gerald talked, disturbing him from his thoughts. Not that those thoughts were any good, mainly trying to find a way to perhaps kidnap a princess, and whether to ransom said princess or to keep her for a bed warmer. Turning to look over his shoulder, he answered Gerald, \"Me, and every other mariner that plies these waters.

His large sinewy arms made his climb easy, though not completely effortlessly. By the time he peaked over the gunwale, he was breathing heavily. It was no matter, there would be time to catch his breath later.He flopped over the railing and, as he was picking himself up off the deck, the first thing he saw were a pair of worn boots standing a few meters away. As he stood up, he took in the whole thing. It was another skeleton. Though this one was wearing clothes. Worn leather boots, torn dark trousers, a thick leather button-up jacket that was open, revealing the white rib-bones, and a large tricorne hat over a dirty red bandanna to top it off. In its hand, with its arm outstretched towards Gerald, was a thin saber with the slightest of curves towards the tip. Pointed right at Gerald.\u00a0\"So ye come to murder me crew and plunder me ship, eh?\" It asked in a hollow voice. It was the same voice that had been booming through the sky just moments ago, though this time it wasn't a disembodied voice(obviously), and much more quiet. Like a normal speaking voice. Though it still had an eerie tone to it. Gerald slowly straightened his back up and stared the dead pirate down as he took in the situation. His muscles in his arms and chest tense. Poised. Ready to spring out in action for his defense, if need be. He had no weapon, save for the dagger in his boot, so his only option was to get out of the way and either try to disarm the skeleton captain, or get some distance long enough to pull his dagger out. What could a dagger would do against a skeleton, he wasn't sure. Better than using his fists, however. \"Ye won' git no further, yeller bellied crook. Arm thyself, I challenge ye!\"And this is the story of how Gerald dueled a dead gentlemen pirate captain in single combat...Unfortunately for Minx, she would not be able to escape simply by trying to pry apart the hull. She'd have to crawl out of the alcove she found and through the hold. When the ship shuttered and creak, some bards sprung loose near the crack and blocked the way. She would have to pick her way through the lower deck and find a way above decks...where Gerald was about to duel the skeleton.The Captain was saved thanks to Kuroka, not that the stubborn man wouldn't or couldn't have managed on his own, but nevertheless the last skeleton crewman was down for the count.\u00a0If either wanted to get to Minx, they'd have to climb the ship similarly to Gerald-\u00a0Save for perhaps Kuroka, who seemed to be able to climb much like a real cat. Uncanny.- and then go down belowdecks from the hatches up there.

Sure enough the way she'd wiggled in was closed off, but in the fall, the counter that had been above her folded under the weight of the beams and the counter above her lifted slightly. She blinked before carefully crawling forward to peek through the crack. Her blue eyes frightenedly darted around the ruins of the ships kitchen only to see that she was perfectly alone. She waited a moment, debating with herself internally. It wasn't like she had many other options. So she tucked her dagger back into her before shifting to her knees and taking a breath to brace herself, throwing her weight upwards. The small crack widened just enough that a very dazed Minx was able to haul herself out of her hiding place. She tumbled out onto the floor, panting and coughing a bit as the dust invaded her lungs but she rapidly muffled it. She had no idea where the monsters were after all. So she looked around the shadowy interior of the ship before she spotted the hole that had been created when the beams fell down and freed her from the cabinet. There was some light filtering through so for a lack of anything better to do, she started to climb up using the debris. If she went out the way she came, she might encounter more skeletons. So maybe... if she made her way up to the deck that would be safe? And so she went, climbing through the working of the ship like a odd silver haired squirrel, unknowingly getting closer to where the real fight- between Gerald and the undead captain was.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Minx gave another yelp and covered her head with her arms as the boards tumbled down and barricaded the way that she came into the cupboard.
