The object, which is the best word for it, is a big hunk of shimmering nothing roughly in the shape of a needle, one a giant might use. It is only visibly detectable because it is where the disturbances originate from. Grasping it would be unique as it has no substance despite being solid.

Holding it would also be mildly distressing since the distortions do not cease.

No doubt this would take much longer than it had to float down, especially with the distortions confusing his senses.He still kept an eye out for nearby danger, but his ability to visibly see them was reduced by the distortions in the water around him. Because of this, Tyrell expends some of his magic to create an orb-shaped veil around him.
