For without its trade, The Free States would still be The Free City, and the world would be worse off for it. However, due to the wildly successful efforts of Empress Naoki   , and her careful management of Isra\u2019s economy, we have the pleasure of living in the world we do today. Through her liaisons with other heads of state, she has forged numerous trade pacts and opened many paths for commerce and all that is associated with it, to flow through.This is one such path. Though The Free Plains and The Duchy of Meridian are not particularly far away from each other, standing between them is a steep, nigh impassable range of mountains, and at the foot of those mountains lies a forest that few dare to enter. This border is not quite impenetrable, but it is certainly inconvenient. As such, the majority of travel between Isra and Meridian is conducted by sea. The route is very simple. From Port Silverion, sail south, with the coastline off one\u2019s portside. Continue until New Brimiarde; either stop at New Brimiarde or continue south to Stonevale. To return, sail north, with the coastline on one\u2019s starboard side. As the distance is relatively short, and both merchants and Isranian warships alike sail the route all but continually, there is little danger in sailing these waters. But even so, the sea herself is often danger enough. Though the coast is your guide, guiding you, so too can it be your undoing, as the coast of Meridian is fraught with rocks and sudden storms have been known to best the unwary sailor.One sailing through these waters may eventually find themselves in one of the following locations. The destinations of this route are Port Silverion, New Brimiarde, and Stonevale. If one were to land or crash on the coast, they would find themselves either on the shores of The Free Plains or the coastline of Meridian, depending on how far north or south they might be at the time.", "link_list": ["https://uvar.deviantart.com/art/Sea-sunset-103677366", "/user/607", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/board/236/free-plains-isra", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/board/248/region-medan", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/97/post-first-northern-border-crossing", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/2041/misty-woods", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/board/293/port-silverion", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/board/39/new-brimiarde", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/board/8/stonevale", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/1598/coastline-coastal-road-post-first", "http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/2141/post-first-coastline"], "image_list": ["http://i.imgur.com/0zSilPn.jpg"], "html": "<div align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://uvar.deviantart.com/art/Sea-sunset-103677366\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Sea sunset by uvar\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/0zSilPn.jpg\" style=\"max-width:85%;\"/></a></div>"}, "post-94774": {"user": "Empress Naoki", "user_num": 607, "timestamp": "1579644663000", "message": "[Enter from The Free Docks]The Indulgence\u2019s prow is as a golden blade cutting through the water -- swiftly and effortlessly, leaving a great wake in its trail.

The cooks were singularly confused to hear of the first two\u2019s encounter, and so decided just to send over a selection of The Empress\u2019s preferred items they can whip up relatively quickly.As such, the cart contains two bowls of the aforementioned stew, a tray of biscuits, a small platter of grapes, a box of fancy chocolates, a bowl of mixed nuts, a kettle of something piping hot, a few wines to choose between, two trays of hors d'oeuvres, a small pie, a tray of cheese and bread, \u2014 and some apples, seeing as how Her Guest had requested apples earlier. (The cart isn\u2019t actually very little at all. It takes up much of the hallway.)The pages are at an impasse. Usually, The Empress would direct them, but she\u2019s... not here? Perhaps indecent, just out of view\u2026?They don\u2019t dare to enter without invitation, and as such look to Keph, prompting. He has the reins, they will do more or less as he asks.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "On his way out the door, Keph only makes it a few paces down the hall before encountering not just one, but a pair of page boys of similar age and build to himself. They\u2019re meandering down the corridor, looking sharp in their matching tunics, carrying on a conversation between themselves. Their shift just ended, and they were on their way back to their quarters before The Empress\u2019s door creaks open in front of them. "}}
