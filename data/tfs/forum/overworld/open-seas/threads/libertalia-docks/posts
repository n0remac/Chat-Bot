The Docks sit in the middle of the southern cove that makes up the horseshoe island, and is manned by some of the best trained labourers in the world. Large warehouses dot one side, while the sturdy docks themselves are dotted with four huge cranes, operated by Dwarf and Troll combos, one to do the delicate manoeuvring, and the other to provide the raw power, pushing and pulling.

The reason for her silence is clear, given the lack of shoes or any metalwork other than her golden hoop earrings that contrast nicely against her tanned skin. The Cat of the Sea Dragon. \"Douglas seems giddy about your newest haul.

It seemed to be a quiet day in the port today, giving the port master, a Mr. Jim Davinshore a well deserved break. The night before he and his lads had seen to the loading of five Isran trade vessels, six independants, and two home fleet ships, all destined to parts unknown, all of which satisfied him greatly. Not only were the jobs done well, on time, and without the loss of any wares, and the money it brought in to the island only added to that very satisfaction. So, he\u2019s spent the day in one of the watchtowers in the harbour, idly watching any ships on the horizon to see if they were coming in, which so far none had. In fact, there wasn\u2019t anything on the docket for today, by some stroke of luck. Still, he watches and idly sips on a mug of ale his daughter had run up for him not an hour before. Another hour passes as he sits, enjoying his time off, until finally he spot something on the horizon. Its tiny and even through his spy glass he barely makes it out, a testament to the luck of even spotting such a thing so far away. As it draws closer, his bearded features scrunch up a little and he hums. \u201cStrange\u2026\u201d As it draws nearer, her climbs down the ladders and walks towards the docks, still watching the small craft come in. He can see it clearer now, clearly a jury rigged ship, driven by, what? A child? He hums to himself again as he watches, whoever it was knows what they\u2019re doing that\u2019s for sure. Then it gets closer and closer. \u201cSlow up\u2026\u201d he mumbles to himself. \u201cSlowly now\u2026 Uh oh.\u201d He takes several steps back, waving at the others on the dock to do the same as the catamaran comes careening towards them, then inevitably crashes. \u201cWhat the hell?!\u201d he calls out as the small person goes end over end onto the dock as their little boat sinks. Once the woman settles, Jim rushes over to see if she\u2019s injured, but in no time she\u2019s on her feet. No, not a dwarf, not stocky enough, and too short to be an elf. \u201cA gnome?!\u201d he says in surprise as he takes off his tricorn hat and scratches his messy hair. \u201cWell, Ferryman take me\u2026\u201d He seems confused for a few short moments before taking her hand and shaking it. \u201cJim Davinshore, portmaster,\u201d he says, then shakes his head. \u201cI have no idea what yer talkin\u2019 about Gnome\u2026 uh, Tinker?\u201d Damn these gnomes and their strange little words. \u201cBut if I\u2019m hearin\u2019 y\u2019 right, yer an inventor?\u201d He still seems confused about the whole matter. They already had teams of dwarven engineers making strides in technology for them, one of the biggest assets they had in their alliance with the Rune King in the mountain at the center of the island, but considering she was able to get such speed and such distance on such a jury rigged craft, and had the confidence to do so, spoke some measure of her intellect. \u201cCaptain\u2019ll never believe what I\u2019ve seen here\u2026\u201d he says as he scratches his head again. \u201cT\u2019 be honest with y\u2019, gnome, I\u2019ve no clue where y\u2019d get employment fer yer talents.

The last of the newest batch of Isran trade ships had left port an hour ago, and their Libertalian escorts had peeled off along the horizon, letting them head off into sea on their own to meet up with their own escorts. Its a system that seemed to work, as far as he could tell, but it\u2019d been a while since he\u2019d sailed under the black flag, not since he\u2019d been promoted to head of the docks. Not that he didn\u2019t love his new job, but it\u2019d been a long while since he\u2019d felt the ocean wind in his head. Perhaps he\u2019ll take a holiday soon and leave the port in the hands of his daughter Sunny. He hears Xibalba is nice this time of year\u2026His musings are cut short when he spots a new ship turn towards Libertalia, one he\u2019d not been expecting on the schedule. Through his spyglass he sees that its a ship type he\u2019s never really seen before, one that piques his curiosity. \u201cSails!\u201d He calls down to the port below. \u201cUnknown origin!\u201d That gets people hustling.Usually when an unknown ship is coming to harbour, there\u2019s a cause for some alarm, one that isn\u2019t taken lightly. Most of the time its fine, but there\u2019s been once or twice in recent years where a band of pirate hunters has tried to invade via the port, extremely misguided sort, and always swiftly defeated. They just don\u2019t get that Libertalians aren\u2019t pirates, and are much more organised than most would think. Several Peacekeepers, Libertalia\u2019s defenders, gather at the docks, weapons holstered for now, but ready to bring them out at a moment\u2019s notice. They weren\u2019t expecting any resistance, but it never hurt to be ready regardless. \u201cStand ready!\u201d their captain calls as the ship\u2019s hands leap over, but he lowers his hand when he sees them just docking the ship. An invading force just doesn't do that, not one that stands a chance at least. \u201cAh, nevermind lads.\u201d The dockmaster steps forward and gestures for the other dock workers to help settle the ship, seeing that it's definitely not a threat. \u201cGet this ship secured, boys!\u201d The dock workers, all from several difference races from human to Av\u2019rae, dwarf to Ogre, all work with the strange new folk to secure the ship. \u201cWelcome t\u2019 Libertalia!\u201d he says after the plank is extended and lands. He holds up a hand in greeting as he speaks. \u201cThis is unexpected to say the least, apologies for the armed welcome! Y\u2019aren\u2019t on the list fer today, an\u2019 at that speed it puts us a wee bit on edge. Name\u2019s Jim Davinshore, port master.

Some in awe continued to work, and when the ship was secured they couldn't stop staring with noses wiggling, some murmuring between each other. The ones that took the culture shock less than favorably stayed painfully close to the ship or returned aboard. Several of the before-mentioned tiny heads were peeking up around near the bow to look at all these strange happenings.As the port master bellowed his greeting, several new faces descended the plank - these being more uniform. There were half a dozen cat men with jaguar heads and furred bodies despite the human shaped torso. And these were dressed with leather greaves and pauldrons and bracers, as well as a breastplate of a gold color, around a simple wrap skirt of white silk that stopped at the knee. Their weapon of choice was a simple spear, which was carried point up rather than in offense. The small unit filed off the plank and stopped, followed by a towering creature that walked with a heavy gait that commanded power - requiring the wider ramp to descend safely.The beast had the lower half of a clear lion with a well groomed pelt where there weren't clean shaved patches that revealed scarring - potentially from battles or fights. The giant paws looked large enough to crush a skull, unyielding claws lightly scratching the wood build of the docks with each step. The forelegs were armored while the rear saw only leather greaves. The shoulders and back and chest were also armored, showing nicks and scratches akin to conflict - and the body shifted up to a humanoid torso like that of a centaur. It was completely furred like the lower half, and atop the shoulders was a lion's head. The armor across his shoulders and forearms and chest was alike the gold-colored plates of the entourage of 6. The thick mane looked to have been shaven along the sides of the neck and beneath the chin, leaving a rather long, dark trail from atop the head and between the ears along the neck and halfway down the back. However, despite his standing, he seemed to carry no weapon aside from his clawed hands and four paws.When he came to stand ahead of his soldiers, it was clear he stood around 7 feet up to the withers, but the torso and head put him to around 9 feet in total height. He came to stand just ahead of his escort, and while the port master spoke he then lowered himself to... sit? The lower half settled down as if a cat lying down on it's belly, but the torso remained upright. When the joke was posed, a grimace settled across the features of the leonine beast, and he bowed his head. \"I hope you will forgive our intrusion, the,\" he replied, his voice deep and strong. \"We were desperate, and had been sailing for days. I am Ilonhi, envoy of the Ede'fel and guardian brother to Lady Jawbariya of Jevu'ri. We have a dozen families on board and a handful of soldiers, but we are out of food and very tired.

It seemed to be a quiet day in the port today, giving the port master, a Mr. Jim Davinshore a well deserved break. The night before he and his lads had seen to the loading of five Isran trade vessels, six independants, and two home fleet ships, all destined to parts unknown, all of which satisfied him greatly. Not only were the jobs done well, on time, and without the loss of any wares, and the money it brought in to the island only added to that very satisfaction. So, he\u2019s spent the day in one of the watchtowers in the harbour, idly watching any ships on the horizon to see if they were coming in, which so far none had. In fact, there wasn\u2019t anything on the docket for today, by some stroke of luck. Still, he watches and idly sips on a mug of ale his daughter had run up for him not an hour before. Another hour passes as he sits, enjoying his time off, until finally he spot something on the horizon. Its tiny and even through his spy glass he barely makes it out, a testament to the luck of even spotting such a thing so far away. As it draws closer, his bearded features scrunch up a little and he hums. \u201cStrange\u2026\u201d As it draws nearer, her climbs down the ladders and walks towards the docks, still watching the small craft come in. He can see it clearer now, clearly a jury rigged ship, driven by, what? A child? He hums to himself again as he watches, whoever it was knows what they\u2019re doing that\u2019s for sure. Then it gets closer and closer. \u201cSlow up\u2026\u201d he mumbles to himself. \u201cSlowly now\u2026 Uh oh.\u201d He takes several steps back, waving at the others on the dock to do the same as the catamaran comes careening towards them, then inevitably crashes. \u201cWhat the hell?!\u201d he calls out as the small person goes end over end onto the dock as their little boat sinks. Once the woman settles, Jim rushes over to see if she\u2019s injured, but in no time she\u2019s on her feet. No, not a dwarf, not stocky enough, and too short to be an elf. \u201cA gnome?!\u201d he says in surprise as he takes off his tricorn hat and scratches his messy hair. \u201cWell, Ferryman take me\u2026\u201d He seems confused for a few short moments before taking her hand and shaking it. \u201cJim Davinshore, portmaster,\u201d he says, then shakes his head. \u201cI have no idea what yer talkin\u2019 about Gnome\u2026 uh, Tinker?\u201d Damn these gnomes and their strange little words. \u201cBut if I\u2019m hearin\u2019 y\u2019 right, yer an inventor?\u201d He still seems confused about the whole matter. They already had teams of dwarven engineers making strides in technology for them, one of the biggest assets they had in their alliance with the Rune King in the mountain at the center of the island, but considering she was able to get such speed and such distance on such a jury rigged craft, and had the confidence to do so, spoke some measure of her intellect. \u201cCaptain\u2019ll never believe what I\u2019ve seen here\u2026\u201d he says as he scratches his head again. \u201cT\u2019 be honest with y\u2019, gnome, I\u2019ve no clue where y\u2019d get employment fer yer talents. Our workshops\u2019re fully staffed as far as I know.\u201d He puts his other hand on his hip in thought. \u201cCould get a job as a bar wench I guess, but if yer lookin\u2019 fer an invention job, eh\u2026\u201d He looks up the long road towards the captain\u2019s manor. \u201cY\u2019could go ask t\u2019 see Captain O\u2019Malley.

She\u2019s no\u2019 shy about takin\u2019 visitors, no matter how small \u2018n\u2019 strange, like yersel\u2019.\u201d The gnome waves off the dockmaster's concerns.\"Never-ever has the great Tinker Fizzbang met a mountain squat that matched her inventivity! No, dwarfs can forge a tough metal bar, but a gnome can take that metal bar and twist it into a ferrous abyssopelagic eruptive trajectator! Or, or a self-motivating hepatotropic prosthesis! Such grand contrivances would indubitably serve your naval flotilla far more rightly than that uncouth armour they've tapped into your woodwork,\" she responds, placing her hand upon her hip with an air of haughtiness.She snaps her fingers and unslings the strange-looking drum-fed crossbow slung across her back, handing it over for the dockmaster to inspect.\"You see? Every tall-man with whom I confabulate gawks upon this little trinket I set on and finished within a fortnight during a long journey to break the humdrum of skittering about on pony-back. My greatest works are stowed back home, where I titled Magos Fabricus of the entire city of Zfassbar!\" she brags.While her pitch may sound a bit arrogant, it's true that the device she hands the portmaster would surely be considered a great work most of the world over. It's got the look of a repeating crossbow, but it's fed from below out of a drum of several tens of bolts, spring loaded to push themselves into the barrel. Some bizarre contraption that is made up of a series of small copper gears draws the string quickly back after every shot, and a series of valves feeding from a trio of small canisters near the drum magazine terminate in narrow nozzles at the riser, ready to coat the bolts with whatever bubbles within those canisters at the turn of a knob. The split-limbed steel bow and the hinged aluminium stock both fold inward to make the bow more compact if it needs to be stowed, and they can be deployed with the flick of a switch near the trigger.She crosses her arms and looks up at the dockmaster expectantly.\"In brief, I haven't need of worry! I'll outshow all of the mountain squats that come my way, suredly as wyrmfire deliquesces copper. Now, might I entreat you to toss a dock-man my way, in order that I might not get lost tracking this manor?

Its tiny and even through his spy glass he barely makes it out, a testament to the luck of even spotting such a thing so far away. As it draws closer, his bearded features scrunch up a little and he hums. \u201cStrange\u2026\u201d <br/><br/>As it draws nearer, her climbs down the ladders and walks towards the docks, still watching the small craft come in. He can see it clearer now, clearly a jury rigged ship, driven by, what? A child? He hums to himself again as he watches, whoever it was knows what they\u2019re doing that\u2019s for sure. Then it gets closer and closer. \u201cSlow up\u2026\u201d he mumbles to himself. \u201cSlowly now\u2026 Uh oh.\u201d <br/><br/>He takes several steps back, waving at the others on the dock to do the same as the catamaran comes careening towards them, then inevitably crashes. \u201cWhat the hell?!\u201d he calls out as the small person goes end over end onto the dock as their little boat sinks. Once the woman settles, Jim rushes over to see if she\u2019s injured, but in no time she\u2019s on her feet. No, not a dwarf, not stocky enough, and too short to be an elf. \u201cA gnome?!\u201d he says in surprise as he takes off his tricorn hat and scratches his messy hair. \u201cWell, Ferryman take me\u2026\u201d <br/><br/>He seems confused for a few short moments before taking her hand and shaking it. \u201cJim Davinshore, portmaster,\u201d he says, then shakes his head. \u201cI have no idea what yer talkin\u2019 about Gnome\u2026 uh, Tinker?\u201d Damn these gnomes and their strange little words. \u201cBut if I\u2019m hearin\u2019 y\u2019 right, yer an inventor?\u201d He still seems confused about the whole matter. They already had teams of dwarven engineers making strides in technology for them, one of the biggest assets they had in their alliance with the Rune King in the mountain at the center of the island, but considering she was able to get such speed and such distance on such a jury rigged craft, and had the confidence to do so, spoke some measure of her intellect. <br/><br/>\u201cCaptain\u2019ll never believe what I\u2019ve seen here\u2026\u201d he says as he scratches his head again. \u201cT\u2019 be honest with y\u2019, gnome, I\u2019ve no clue where y\u2019d get employment fer yer talents. Our workshops\u2019re fully staffed as far as I know.\u201d He puts his other hand on his hip in thought. \u201cCould get a job as a bar wench I guess, but if yer lookin\u2019 fer an invention job, eh\u2026\u201d He looks up the long road towards the captain\u2019s manor. \u201cY\u2019could go ask t\u2019 see Captain O\u2019Malley. She oversees the island, our leader o\u2019 sorts. Head o\u2019 the admiralty council. She\u2019s on the island, and usually at home. She\u2019s no\u2019 shy about takin\u2019 visitors, no matter how small \u2018n\u2019 strange, like yersel\u2019.\u201d <br/><br/><div class=\"quote_clear\"></div></div></div>"}}
