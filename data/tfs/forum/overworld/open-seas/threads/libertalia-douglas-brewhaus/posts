The very image of a dwarf, although he stands short, his built physique is as large as his beard, which weaves its way down his body in three thick braids. He can often be found at the bar, among his own workers.\u00a0The bar itself is huge, with long latticed windows, exposed beams across the sides and roof, and dark, but cozy atmosphere. The layout is made up of a main floor in the centre, and surrounded on three sides by a raised, squared off horseshoe, both sections covered in tables and chairs of all shapes and sizes to accommodate the city's diverse inhabitants. Once a week, part of the main floor is cleared to allow for a band to play, or to create a dance floor during major events. Three fireplaces are dotted around the ground floor, one on either end of the main floor, and one on the back wall of the raised section.\u00a0Above the main and raised floors sits a balcony level, where you would find the gambling tables and private VIP booths, where all the movers and shakers of the island tend to drink and be merry when they are tired of partying among the crews and citizens of the main floor.\u00a0The third level is guarded by two Peace Keepers at all times, and only a handful are allowed to enter. This floor is reserved for both Gregor's office and home, but also one booth and balcony, newly built as per the Admiralty's instruction, a section known as the Admiralty Lounge. This is a formality, as the Admiralty tends to drink with the people below. The booth is actually built,not only for the Admiralty, but for foreign dignitaries that wish to visit the island and drink in peace and security.\u00a0Finally, the most important part of the Brewhaus, the bar. The bar stretches almost the entire length of the building, with taps of various beers and ciders, some local, some imported from all over the world, and behind the bar are shelves packed with more liquor and wine than you could shake a cutlass at. However, the back wall is made up of massive, colossal kegs, each one in use by the brewery at the back, and each teeming with signature Libertalia Ale.\u00a0Meals are provided from the kitchens off to the side of the main floor, manned by talented cooks, mostly Halflings of course, providing meals if you have coin.\u00a0Paintings hang from the walls all around the building, along with bookshelves placed between windows, used more often on quieter days. Decorative curtains are draped between support pillars, mostly greens and reds, pulled open and strung up to the support pillars by golden rope. Finally, above the bar, sit three large items. A portrait of the bar's proprietor, Gregor Douglas, and Captain Johnnie O'Malley, the nation's leader. Between them sits the Libertalia, and O'Malley's crew, flag. The Fair But Ruthless Anne, a cutlass in one hand, and a scale in the other.\u00a0Come! Stay awhile! Enjoy the warm, cozy atmosphere, or party it up on our busy nights!\u00a0", "link_list": ["http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/3565/libertalia"], "image_list": [], "html": "<a href=\"http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/3565/libertalia\" rel=\"norewrite\" style=\"font-size:large;font-weight:bold;\" target=\"_blank\">Libertalia.</a>"}, "post-92468": {"user": "Desdemona McHerne", "user_num": 3533, "timestamp": "1563070459000", "message": "Opening the door to the main establishment, Desdemona hopped into the tavern, looking over the few guests that resides at this time.

One voice booms over the others though, one that every patron has grown to recognise as none other than Gregor Douglas! \"Here comes trouble! The circus is back in town lads, crack open another barrel!\" He lets out a hearty laugh as Desdemona approaches the bar. He's already pouring her a tankard of the finest Libertalian ale, knowing her order off by heart. \"You know us, Des,\" he says as he passes it over. \"We'll be here long after the sun's burnt out. As for anything new?\" He takes a moment to consider this question, his thick hands idly cleaning a used tankard. \"Few new ships, couple of new crews. For the little people like us? Nothing new,\" he admits. His eyes flick up to the top level and he nods in that general direction. \"But for her? Somethin's brewin'. I've known her a long time, so I've got faith it'll be somethin' good.\" The main floor of the bar is busy and packed with people from all walks of life, being merry and jovial, and the second level isn't much different, as captains and VIPs banter and exchange information or tall tales of the open water, a fine place for a meeting of the minds. The top level though, the most exclusive of them all, seems quiet tonight. Light shines out of the balcony and windows, halted only by the distinctive dark silhouette of the pirate queen herself, leaning on the bannister and watching over her people. Usually at least, but her shadowy gaze is firmly locked on the captain of the Floating Circus. \"Rumour is there's plans of diplomacy,\" Gregor continues. \"We've been around a long time, might as well be time. The port's going to be busier soon.\" ", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The Brewhaus is busy as ever this evening, with folks drinking, eating, and gambling on every level.
