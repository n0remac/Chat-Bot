There was also something she declared:She was not staying there for the rest of her life.Thus, she had ventured far from her rock den, holding onto precious little trinkets that had been given to her by the explorer who had taught her than a world existed outside the endless sands. Some were made from wood and heated clay, things she had never once in her life seen. The explorer spoke of trees that were taller than orcs! Than ogres! He spoke of a place that resembled the sands but was the same color as the sky, ever moving, and either as patient as a viper or as feisty as a swarm of scorpions. It hid thousands of more secrets than the sands in its depths, some beautiful, some... frightening.It wasn't until now that the tiny vulx woman could imagine what that explorer was saying. It had mounds, yes, just like the sands did, but they rose and vanished endlessly beneath them. It was blue and the sky was blue, but the sea was so much darker in a way that reminded Ti'el of mysterious burrows in the sands. The explorer was absolutely right about one thing, however:Ti'el was terrified of it.Dipping down on her knees, she focused on the wooden infrastructure of this... boat, as they called it. It was similar to the little trinkets but on a scale that she did not think possible. Her eyes traced the lines of the boat, further, further, until it took her up to a tall stranger covered in a billowing cloth. The vulx only wore a rough white frock and found herself immediately envious of this woman's regal appearance.As she stood, she took a moment to stare.
