The warm eastern winds combine with the cold western waters to create turbulent\u00a0sea currents. Sailing to the island is nearly impossible, and harsh winds make flying there an equally difficult proposition.Should one survive the journey and somehow reach the island shores,\u00a0the first thing they would notice are the massive rotting carcasses lining the beaches. Further inland are thick jungles which increase in density exponentially. This is still the most hospitable path further into the island. The sheer cliff sides and miasmatic mangroves on the surrounding island fringes are far less forgiving.There is absolutely no sign of civilization. There are no humans, no orcs, no elves, and no kobolds. Nothing even remotely resembling a humanoid lives here.There are however giant footprints.If you could somehow reach the first of a ring of mountain-like elevations, you'll start to finally see some diversity. Past the mountain ranges are valleys, some green and some volcanic. That's also when you would gaze upon the rulers of the island.Monsters.The creatures of this island can range anywhere from 20 to 500 meters tall. Some are dragon-like, some are insectoids, some are reptilian, and some don't fit any known taxonomy classification. It is not uncommon to see these creatures engage in brutal combat, fighting for ultimate control of the island.\u00a0", "link_list": ["https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6qAIaqK3_Q"], "image_list": [], "html": "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Welcome to the end of the world.</i><br>- Pirate Captain Galrun</br></div>"}, "post-59868": {"user": "Lumeena Mako", "user_num": 1022, "timestamp": "1485801075000", "message": "CRASHcrashcrashcrash CRASHcrashcrashcrash...The titanic crab skittered across the mountain and cut a swath through the jungles below. Well over 200 tall and 600 meters wide, the creature was one of the last, and biggest, members of its tribe. Every click of its pincers released a boom like thunder. Its succession of mouth clicks was like cannon fire. Its fiery red chitin was as strong as steel. Its eye stocks were like giant, shimmering opals in the sky.It reared its shell up and raised its massive claws in the air. The sea water that poured off the crevices on its shell flowed into the valley like newly formed rivers.It was looking for a fight.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "CRASHcrashcrashcrash CRASHcrashcrashcrash..."}}
