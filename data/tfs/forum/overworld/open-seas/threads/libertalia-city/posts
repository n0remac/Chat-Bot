The bustling city is filled with everything anyone could want. Pubs, ale houses, feast halls, theatres, brothels, gambling houses, restaurants, shops of all kind, there's something for everyone in Libertalia. The underground quarter, all dwarven made, is home to almost all of the dwarven population, for obvious reasons, as well as halflings and the generally short. It's here where most of the equipment making, distilling and brewing, and other dwarven trades are conducted, as well as the mining operations. It has also become a convenient place to set up the Libertalia Public Vaults, established only ten years prior by the state, a sort of bank for people to keep their valuables, for a small fee. Before this, most had to make do with their own safes, bury their loot, or build their own hidden vaults away from the city. Not very secure...Above ground, among the usual grocers and tailors, one doesn't need to go far to find weapons dealers, spice merchants, livestock auction houses, drug dens and peddlers, if you want to buy something, anything, Libertalia has it. The city itself is intersected by a long main street leading from the docks, starting with a large statue dedicated to Captain Francis O'Malley, the city's founder, and ends in the O'Malley Manor, overlooking the city. Along the main street sit market stalls, travelling vendors, and candle lamps that keep the city glowing long into the night. Signs advertising the various businesses jut out from all along the road, and sign posts, some hastily scrawled, point down the side streets. Sailors may make for great navigators, but even the most experienced need a hand now and again.\u00a0Though some make their homes outside the city, many live within its borders, in houses or small, usually 4 floor, apartment buildings, each one different than the last. The general style remains the same, but there's no counting for who lives within, or how they choose to decorate.

A pirate would have left you on the street, but not my Arthur.\u201d She shakes her head, causing her hair to bob. \u201cWe\u2019re good folks on this island.\u201d She honestly looks a little shocked at his scramblings, reflexively guarding her stomach, but soon relaxes when he scurries to the table. \u201cFor a lad who\u2019s so hungover, you move pretty damn quick,\u201d she says, craning her neck to watch him. Ah! Here\u2019s that little magical  ink display. At least now she could read it, the last time she\u2019d seen it it was mostly the scribblings of a mad chicken. \u201cIts lovely to meet you again as well, Keph,\u201d she says with her sweet little smile. \u201cA good idea, my friend. As I said, your clothes will be washed in a moment. In the meantime, you may use one of our towels. Or go natural, if you feel comfortable, we don\u2019t really mind.\u201d She soon stands with a grunt, her hands at her back to support herself for a moment. \u201cHell, Arthur rarely wears trousers around the apartment anyway.\u201dShe makes note of where the bottle lives, knowing its of the utmost importance to Keph, and gestures to the bathroom. \u201cJust through there, it should be ready by now.\u201dAs if on cue, the very tall Av\u2019 steps out and grins at the pair. \u201cNice and warm,\u201d he announces, stepping to the side. \u201cAnd our best soaps. Use them wisely, Keph, it's not everyday we break them out.\u201d ", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "The kind hearted woman chuckles a little as Keph chugs the whole pitcher down. She settles down with a small relieved sigh at the end of the couch and rests a hand on her tummy, then shifts her attention back to Keph. She\u2019s smelled worse breath, but that doesn\u2019t stop her nose from twitching slightly. She\u2019d have to rustle up something for that too, and thankfully she has just the thing, but she needed a quick rest before she\u2019d get back up again.

While her kindness truly did warm his heart, he wasn't sure kindness excluded one from being a pirate. He was quite sure performing the act of piracy is what dictated if one was a pirate or not. He kept his mouth shut, not that much debate would've left it otherwise.He doesn't bother Brea with having to take care of his bottle of ink, deciding it best to take it with him. It wasn't that he didn't trust her with it... well, maybe it was exactly that, but then again he wouldn't trust his closest friend with it. He swings the string around his neck, letting the bottle and quill hang from his neck. Brea would most likely not notice, but Keph had gone to great lengths to assure that the ink would be safe. The string having been fabricated from some of the toughest silk, produced by Siamese twin arachnids and the bottle's glass had been forged in the breathe of a cyclops dragonid.One malperformed salute later and he was off to the washroom. The clothes had been left outside the door just as he said they would, left in a mess of a pile, his uniform more knick knack than cloth.==================////==================Oh how nice the water felt. Keph had lost track of time. He lay in the bath water, which had a pungent green color. He knew it would be best to get out and refill the bath if he wanted to soak in it, but he could not convince his limbs to leave the bath.\u00a0His bottle floated above the bath, it and the odd squid circlet that adorned his wrist all that embellished his birthday suit.Joyful humming could be heard through the door.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "<b><font face=\"times new roman\">\u300cKeph is a traveller, a traveller can't afford to let luggage slow them down\u300d<br/></font></b>"}, "post-95575": {"user": "libertalianarrator", "user_num": 3526, "timestamp": "1581648273000", "message": "The woman does find it odd how protective he is of his ink, but it doesn\u2019t take a genius to understand it.

A cocked eyebrow here, a blink there, then a nod from the wife to the heap of messy clothes on the floor. Arthur\u2019s eyes go wide, he gives a small laugh, then shakes his head, to which Brea just raises both eyebrows. Arthur\u2019s mirth dies along with his smile as he slumps slightly, much to Brea\u2019s amusement. She\u2019d done most of the work looking after Keph, its only right that Arthur does the laundry. He gathers the clothes up, holds them at arm\u2019s length, and shifts towards the kitchen to start scrubbing. Brea, on the other hands, takes the opportunity to slump back onto the couch and sigh with contented bliss. What luck she had that she could marry a man who not only loves her madly, but also who she could manipulate like putty to get chores done. Keph\u2019s bath is as wonderful as expected, and the soaps are just as good, leaving him smelling so much better, and no longer of stale ale, vomit, and goodness knows what else. His joyful humming isn\u2019t lost on Brea, who can\u2019t help but smile with pride, having turned a gutter rat into a happy guest, and it also gave her the thought that perhaps he isn\u2019t entirely mute after all. Regardless, she sits on her rump with a good book as she waits for the Av\u2019 to do his share of the work. Once finished, Keph may find himself without his clothes for a little while, but they\u2019ve been hung out to dry and are just about as clean as he is.
