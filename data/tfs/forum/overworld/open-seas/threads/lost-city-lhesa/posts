Further inland, thick vegetation makes overland travel similarly troublesome. The white stone of taller buildings in the city proper can be seen rising above the trees from the sea, but once in the jungles, visibility is limited to relatively close ranges.Up close, the city is much more fallen and in disrepair than it appears from a distance. The buildings are largely still standing, but where there had once been wooden doors and shutters, they now stand open to the elements. The streets are broken and overgrown with plants, and the tile roofs of many of the smaller buildings have fallen in.And yet, the ruined city is still beautiful. Marble statues of men and women carved with incredible detail and skill stand tall and majestic almost everywhere, and even the ones that have fallen and broken remain strikingly beautiful. Even the smallest and most humble buildings are decorated with intricately-carved scenes of heroes and animals.

There was no sign of the sort of structural damage that would accompany a civilization-ending disaster such as a massive earthquake, volcanic eruption, or tidal wave. Quite the opposite, in fact, with all the buildings they had seen so far in a much better state than one would expect after centuries of standing forgotten in the jungles.\u201cMaybe whatever happened took this particular house by surprise?

Maybe they will shed some light on things in a more detailed study. Either way, they will certainly go a long way towards funding this expedition.
