As such the majority of their noble families were unknown. That made it rather easy to pretend to be a noble from there. There wasn't really anyone who could say he wasn't yet. Lisere didn't need to know that though at least not yet. He had decided to come clean with her after they made good on their escape. It would be monumentally stupid of him to do so, but he felt bad. And ultimate Aesen was still a teenager dealing with a lot of hormones. Confessing to the cute girl seemed like a good idea. After making the rounds and saying hello to their host. A rich merchant by the name of Aldrin Leloux, Aesen would lead Lisere onto the dance floor. There he would quite boldly place a hand on her hip and use the other to take hers.
