From up here, as he climbed downward, Gerald had a wonderful view of the events unfolding, the grappling hooks being slung at the merchant vessel, pirates jeering and mocking the surrendering sailorsAs soon as his boots hit the deck with a loud thud, Gerald raced toward starboard with a gleeful chuckle. As much as he loved a fight, the rush of adrenaline and the smell of blood and fear in the air, he loved a peaceful surrender of his enemies almost just as much...almost. More live captives and slaves meant more ransoms on top of the bounty found aboard the ship. And there are not many things Gerald loves more than extra gold.Flashing Captain Woolworth a wink, Gerald hopped onto the gangplank and rushed onto the other ship right as the other pirates were pushing all the surrendered sailors on their knees. He felt confident and secure, and felt no need to draw his weapon as he swiftly approached the Captain\u2019s quarters. Most of the others would be busy heading down below and overwatching the now-prisoners hauling the precious cargo back aboard The Tyger. Beaming at the merchant, Gerald kicked open the doors to his private quarters and entered the dimly lit room. He ran his fingers over the rough wooden table covered in parchments, maps, and unlit candles. He walked around the table and kicked the plain wooden chair out of the way, and began opening the drawers of the desk. He didn\u2019t have a lot of time, hurriedly rifled through the desk.Unfortunately, he found little of worth, other than a small coin purse and freshly carved, unstained, smoking pipe made of ugly pine with poor grain. Oh well, it\u2019ll get the job done whenever he found some tobacco. Maybe when this is all said and done, he could afford some of that good shit blessed by magic so the moisture aboard a ship won\u2019t ruin the flavor.Gerald cast one last eye around the modest quarters before shrugging and leaving. Didn\u2019t even find a gold ring, he thought to himself, shaking his head in disappointment. Coming out of the cabin, Gerald noticed that the job as just about done, with the other pirates, save a handful, were returning to They Tyger, and the merchant\u2019s sailors nowhere to be seen. Smiling, Gerald slowly crossed the gangplank, hand resting lazily on the hilt of his cutlass while his other casually tossed the coin purse up in the air, repeatedly, as he approached his own Captain.The small coin purse couldn\u2019t hold but a handful of coins, but Gerald thought it was a suitable tribute for a beginning. Boots thudding against the stairs up the aftcastle, Gerald approached Captain Woolworth with a cheery smile, eyes lit up, and attempted to get the man\u2019s attention. Assuming he had it, Gerald tossed the small bag of golden coins towards his captain, followed by a small wink. \u201cAll yours, Cap\u2019n,\u201d Gerald quietly said in passing, as he approached the netting up the mizzen-mast.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "After making sure the top mizzen-sail was securely furled in place as "}, "post-81508": {"user": "Henry Walworth", "user_num": 2931, "timestamp": "1523423074000", "message": "Henry didn't even bothering boarding the prize, remaining by the wheel as both decks swarmed with the movement of pirates and sailors.

So, instead, he helped coax the prisoners into loading the captured goods onto The Tyger and, when finished, returned to their vessel again. Gerald wondered, with all the ships they were piloting back home instead of scuttling them, how much more before they had nothing but a skeleton crew aboard The Tyger. With the wind rustling his ginger hair, his legs spread apart and set steadily on the high platform, both arms grasping the top mizzen lanyard, muscles tensed and taut, Gerald looked over his shoulder and down towards the deck far below, down at his captain. He narrowed his eyes and frowned thoughtfully, praying his new captain knew what he was doing. Henry Woolworth carried himself with a confidence that suggested he did, but Gerald couldn\u2019t help but be a little wary. The last thing he\u2019d want would be to be set upon by a military vessel with nothing but a handful of crew left aboard.Fortunately for Gerald, the very military ship he feared appeared on the horizon long before that could happen.

He yearned for the rush of blood and adrenaline in his veins amidst battle.Setting the top mizzen to half sail and tying the lanyard tightly around the metal cleat attached to the mast, Gerald dropped to his hands and knees, swung his legs off the platform and slipped his feet into the netting to begin his quick descent down to the deck. He wanted to be a part of this battle. The second ballistae shot took the helmsman\u2019s life right as Gerald\u2019s leather boots thudded on the aftcastle deck.

Waiting for the perfect time to begin his maneuver. He had since stopped laughing. In fact, he wasn't even smiling anymore. His face was contorted into an expression of immense focus and concentration. This had to be perfectly right for him to be able to pull it off without damaging The Tyger.\"DON'T YE WORRY, CAP'N!\" Gerald shouted over his shoulder. \"THAT PRETTY RAM OF THEIRS WON'T GET WITHIN A MILE OF US!\"Five...four...three...\u00a0The darkening dusky sky lit up as the pyromancer ignited the oil splashed across the foredeck of the enemy galleass. Using the bright flickering flames as a guide to know where the ship was, Gerald smiled....two......ONE!\u00a0His counting done, Gerald heaved on the wheel, turning it quickly to the left. The ship was going slow enough with the sails up and the wind in their face for their turn-radius to be small, fortunately. The boon swung rapidly in response, dangerous to anyone not paying attention, and The Tyger turned port side, just barely clearing the enemy galleass' ram, who, moments before, no doubt assumed victory was at hand. The Tyger's rapid turn tilted the ship dangerously to the port side, almost costing Gerald his balance, and the galleass' ram just managed to nick the corner of The Tyger's sterncastle as the two ships passed within inches of each other, and some of the flames licked the hull of The Tyger, though none seemed to spread over and catch the ship alight.The Tyger shuddered violently at the strike and the sounds of creaking and snapping wood could be heard, clear as day, part of which was, no doubt, the banks of oars on the galleass\u2019 starboard side breaking like toothpicks. Wooden splinters from the stern of The Tyger flew into the sea behind the ship, but the damage was minimal and above the waterline, fortunately. However, the force of the blow caused the bow of The Tyger to wrench to the right and lifted the bow partly out of the water. It crashed into the galleass\u2019 stern, the main mast\u2019s spur collided with the galleass\u2019 own mast, causing a tangle of rope and wood and canvas, and the rest of the enemy\u2019s oars broke as the unstoppable Tyger drove through them, violently driving the large wooden poles into the oarsmen\u2019s sternums, breaking ribs and arms. If Gerald listened carefully enough, he thought he could hear the screams of the men below decks in the enemy\u2019s galleass. Of course, this was most likely just his sick and twisted imagination.The sudden and violent collision had knocked Gerald and a few others off their feet. He kept a tight grip on the wheel and used its support to regain his feet and balance quickly. He then let out a quick sigh and sucked in a lung full of air to catch his breath before shouting \u201cYou fucks get them grappling hooks ready!\u201d through gritted teeth. He was worried the cacophony of sounds of splintering wood, the rushing waves of the sea, and the gusting wind would drown his words out, but the fear was unfounded, for the men had already been preparing the grappling hooks, probably under the Captain's own orders.", "link_list": [], "image_list": [], "html": "Gerald let out a bark of crazed laughter in response to Captain Walworth's angry shout, not the least bit worried, from either his captain's anger or the dangerous risk he was taking with his plan. He didn't falter or back down after Walworth's shout, and maintained his heading straight at the galleass. With the three masts partially blocking his frontal view of his target, he stood slightly to the side with a single hand on the wheel. He had to keep eye contact so he knew when to break away. The sun and wind were in their faces, making it difficult to see and to keep the speed up when heading in a straight shot."}, "post-81693": {"user": "Henry Walworth", "user_num": 2931, "timestamp": "1523899719000", "message": "Most of the landing crew were knocked off their feet as The Tyger\u00a0rose above the galleass, and their masts became intertwined.
