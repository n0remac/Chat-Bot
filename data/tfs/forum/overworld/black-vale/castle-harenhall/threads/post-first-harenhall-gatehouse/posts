Above the portcullis sits a large gatehouse with a hatch in the bottom for pouring boiling oil upon intruders and a single small window from which to view the approach. The Black Road approaching Harenhall has been cleared of all trees, shrubbery or overgrowth, so that guardsmen are able to see approaching threats from a long ways off. In addition, a large moat has been dug, a deep, dark pit over which the only path is a sturdy wooden bridge allowing no more than three men to stand upon it side-by-side. Glowing, eerie eyes peer up from the pit, following the steps of all comers as they walk overhead. This choke point makes it easy for archers on the walls to pick off invaders, and any who fall into the pit will surely be eaten by one of the many devilish abominations that inhabit it.", "link_list": [], "image_list": ["http://www.itraveluk.co.uk/photos/data/1174/medium/castle-gatehouse.jpg"], "html": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.itraveluk.co.uk/photos/data/1174/medium/castle-gatehouse.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"/>"}, "post-26064": {"user": "Ubba of Valland", "user_num": 1138, "timestamp": "1456686334000", "message": "Ubba approaches the castle slowly.
