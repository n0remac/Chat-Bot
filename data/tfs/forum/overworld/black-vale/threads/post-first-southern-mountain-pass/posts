The scenery is beautiful; the path passes between two snow-capped mountains covered in evergreens, and the path itself is surrounded on both sides by a great forest. Giant Aesgir Elk bound through the woods, an ancient species whose gigantic horns span about three feet to either side. Dire wolves prowl the woods looking for prey, although they rarely attack travelers. Wildlife is all around, and one might even call it serene and idyllic.Despite the beauty of it all, however, eerie pairs of dead eyes look down at travellers from ravens that line the path, the undead birds constantly vigilant. Thus, an intruder's arrival is known well in advance of the walled border posting, whose thick many-layered palisades and portcullises and dual watchtowers monitor the road's carefully. Any who approach are asked their business and searched thoroughly before being let through to the border town of Greenvale.
