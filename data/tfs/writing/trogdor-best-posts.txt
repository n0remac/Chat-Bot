Trogdor glided over the ocean.  He had left his home continent in disobedience to the clan in order to reclaim what rightfully belonged to the dragons.  Gold and riches.  As a young whelp Trogdor and his family had been driven away from the human's continent and many of his kind had been killed.  Now, an adult 60 ft tall and competent in his use of magic, Trogdor returned for revenge.  The humans, naive to their puniness, had started wars over land and wealth, attempting to claim it all for their selves.  The dragons during that time, being religious fools, had tried to keep the peace.  Then, instead of truly fighting when the humans turned on them, the dragons had fled the land because it was the will of Lo.  What nonsense. Trogdor would teach the puny humans a lesson.  He would show them which race was the strongest and deserved to rule.  He would bath the cities of man in fire and burninate the country side.  Soon his brethren would follow him across the seas and join him...then the Age of Dragons would begin.Ahead and below him the land was coming into sight.  The city of Stonevale sat on the coast waiting for him.  Tired after his long flight Trogdor did not have the energy to ravish the city, but he could give them a taste of his power and make his demands.  Beginning to fly in a spiral Trogdor drew upon his mana source.  He summoned the winds to his body and started to form a tornado.  The viscous winds would soon suck up the ocean starting a water cyclone.  Trogdor had used much of him mana in the flight and thus was not capable of summoning a full hurricane, but that would come later.  The dragon roared his name, "TROGDOR!" Letting himself be known.

As Fenris explored the mountains he would have a hard time using his vision amid the black fog and would need to rely on other senses.  He would notice few other beasts on the mountain as many of them had gathered in Trogdor's cave.  He may notice slightly darker parts of the fog.  If he walked through these his animalistic side would be drawn to Trogdor's lair.   It would be unwise to seek the dragon in it's lair.  Better to wait or bait it out of the mountains.  Venturing into a dragon cave was almost surely a death wish.

Trogdor glided over the large forest in search of Zaltos's mana signature.   Teh dragon knew he was close and suspected that his rider was about to have a little fun in Goraia.  How could Trogdor resist such a chance.  Blood began to burn hot in anticipation.  In a bout of joy Trogdor flew low and let out a gout of flame across the forest.  People for miles would see signs of his destruction.

In the depths of his agony Trogdor did not notice the approach of the storm dragon. When the blue dragon came within his sight, Trogdor quit his thrashing and growled menacingly. He bared his teeth half spread his wings in order to leap into action at the first sign of danger. The only other movement he made was a slow crawl backwards.
