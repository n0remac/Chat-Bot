Puck twirled and danced gayly on a lily pad in the garden.  What a wonderful find this place was.  Coming out of a spin, Puck dashed across the water, leaving a trail of ripples behind himself.  Stepping from the water's surface, he walked up an imaginary staircase up to a rock that stuck out of the water.  Raising his hand into the air Puck shouted.  "I claim this island in the name of Lord Puck!  King of the Garden City!"Little did the fairy know, a beast of unknown ferociousness and intelligence had been observing.  The monster had a scaly hide and dark foreboding eyes.  It had jaws capable of consuming puck in one gulp.  It circled as the fairy monologued, preparing to strike.The koi fish jumped out of the pond straight at puck, mouth open.  With a flap of the wings the fairy leaped into the air avoiding the gold fish.  Lord Puck summoned his battle key (which was really only an old skeleton key with a sharpened bit).  "Be gone dragon!"  Puck yelled at the water. He pointed dramatically with the mighty blade.  "You have no power here!"A light flickered in a room in the castle and Puck forgot about the game.  Curious at the activity the fairy flew to the window in order to sate his curiosity.

Puck giggled then phased and the flick passed through blue light.  The light zoomed down the back of the chair and hid behind the chair leg.  When the old dude finished retying his shoe Puck returned under the table and somersault out of his light ball. Giggling Puck wondered how Tanis would respond. Puck set about fixing the shoe's laces.  This time the fairy would tie the right shoe to the left shoe and the left shoe to the table leg.  He crossed his legs and leaned back in the air, hoping for a show.

Lord Puck, of the Magic Mushroom Kingdom(will be formalized when name is decided), shall send an underling to help in small ways for large rewards.

Darkness all around! The eye in the sky had been shut. The Garden Nation had been freed from the corrupting light of the phoenix.After being released from the spells of the orb of judgement Puck had been ashamed to see what had become of the garden. In a fit of tears at his part in the ruined beauty, the little fairy had fled Stonevale.  He lost himself in the woods seeking peace and quite...Or perhaps a new adventure to help him forget the terrible Goraian days.Puck had found himself a mossy stump.  Atop it he had placed a pine cone, rock, and stick in a circle and was commencing a tea party, "Oh no Mr. Stick, you have had far to much sugar in your tea already. Here, have a biscuit." The stick stood upright, having been stabbed into the stump. Puck "fed" a leaf to Mr. Stick."Oh no Miss Cone, I don't think Squirrel will be joining us today. Rock was awfully rude to him last time." The inane chatter went on and on for Puck was capable of goofing off indefinitely.

"Yipee!" Said, Puck, as he threw the rock at the pinecone.  He went to kick a mushroom, but stopped, "No one actually ate the biscuits, right?"
