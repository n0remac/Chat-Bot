Sept 15, 2015 11:30:52 GMT -8 Skarlet said:"Alright, alright, I'll stick around and see how things work here." Skarlet looks down. "Maybe this place will be better than the last few places I've stayed.""I can guarantee that it will be. Drop by my office if you need anything, or ask any of the staff. We all wear something with a little purple gem on it, like this one."Naoki gestures to her earring, which shines a bit as it's being mentioned. "If you're up for it, I'll set you up in a room of your own."

As her door opens, Madame Naoki gives the crowd a regal wave before stepping down onto the stage. From the crowd, cheers erupt, and half-intoxicated patrons of the Midnight Sun cheer her name. Flagons descend upon tables repeatedly, adding a drum line to her procession down the stage. Madame Naoki covers her mouth with one hand and endeavors to quiet the crowd with the other.She is wearing an expensive, yet not overtly ostentatious purple velvet and lace dress. The sheer lace intersperses segments of velvet, introducing shapes and patterns to the otherwise shimmering form-fitting garment. The outfit manages to convey an air of regality underscored with a mature allure.Naoki walks up to her podium, and paws at the attached microphone a bit, to ensure it's working. A soft hum rolls from the speakers, before she begins to speak."Hello, I am Madame Naoki. I own and manage Free City's renown Midnight Sun. My hobbies include singing, dancing, and managing the Midnight Sun. I dream of a world wherein all people can freely and happily live out their lives, lifted from the chains of hunger and poverty. In relationships, I value mutual honesty, openness, and a willingness to have a bit of fun."She glances up at Kate, upon the other stage, and gives a warm smile, twitching her ears in that enticing way that only cats can.

Breathing heavily, Naoki leans over and responds. "It's most like magic, really. But not really like fireball, chanting incantations, manipulating mana, magic. Kinda more like... feeling... influence."She giggles a bit to herself, and adjusts her dress. "It's fun, don't you think?"

Oct 12, 2015 0:13:21 GMT -8 Skarlet said:Oct 11, 2015 23:46:48 GMT -8 Empress Naoki said:As Skarlet relates her story, Madame Naoki nods every so often. At the mention of the ‘handsome guy’, her eyebrows rise, and she smirks. “Fair enough, we all get caught from time to time. Glad you weren't hurt in the attacks.”She writes a bit more on one of the documents, looks over it, and, apparently finished, rolls it up, stamps it, and places it on the side of the desk, where it rolls onto the floor to join the rest.“So I take it you’d like to stick around, then? I can’t blame you, I do my best to make this place the best it can be. That makes you a prospective employee... Let me run through my usual set of questions for prospective employees, then.”She clears her throat, and thinks for a moment before beginning.“What skills or talents do you have, and how do you think you might use them here in the Midnight Sun? I don’t know that much about you, or your past, otherwise I’d skip this one.”"Well, yeah I don't mind it here. You guys have bottles of blood too for some reason, so that's nice that I haven't had to feed off anyone since I've been here. I'm really grateful for being taken in by you, so I'd like to stick around for now." Skarlet listens to Naoki's questions and thinks."Uhhh, what am I good for... I've cracked a guys head open before? Ehehehe... Uh, well, I don't really know what skills I have, I used to not be able to read but I've learned to read a little, so I think I'm able to learn whatever I need to quick. What do you think I could do?" Skarlet fiddled with her fingers nervously, her left hand moving around the fingers of her right hand in the sling, she wanted to be useful in some way but she struggled to come up with talents she has.“Hmm. Well, how about this. Let’s figure out what you’re good at, and teach you some skills. All of my employees are very talented, and are the best at what they do. What if you spend a few days working and learning from some of them?”Madame Naoki dips her quill into the ink bottle, and continues writing.“Perhaps spend one day tending the bar with Kevin. Another with Resse, one with Mr. Screwtape, and then spend a day with Artemis and I. Get a taste of what we all do, see if you find something you’d like. Like, a miniature apprenticeship program perhaps.”She cocks her head to one side and considers what she just wrote. Apparently dissatisfied, she takes the parchment between her two hands, crumples it up, and tosses it backwards, nearly hitting Artemis in the head.“If you’re not opposed to the idea, I’ll go ahead and let everyone know. Do you have any preference as to who you’d like to work with first?”

Naoki too, glances upwards at the sun as it continues its journey across the sky unobscured. In a few short hours, it would be time for lunch.“I think that our first stop could be the grand bazaar; to do some shopping, and assemble a picnic basket. With that basket, we could leave the city, and go have a picnic somewhere. Then we would have some time to spend before returning for dinner.”Naoki speaks with her hands and a slightly more businesslike manner as she illustrates the proposed schedule, motioning with her hands to mimic the travel she’s referring to. When Kate mentions changing, she nods in acknowledgment and agreement. “Alright. Take your time; I’m not in any rush.”Naoki decides it wouldn’t be a good idea to explore the store any further herself, so she opts to lean against one of the nearby structural pillars, holding her hat in her hands, where she will wait until approached.

In response to Whir’s inquiry, the clouded orb sitting on the table begins to resolve its mist into shapes. Over the course of a few seconds, the head and shoulders of Madame Naoki make themselves visible. She takes a moment to look at Whir, and allow the image to stabilize on her end before speaking, “It is indeed, and you are. To whom do I owe the pleasure, and what business do you have with me?”

The door swings open, creaking slightly on its hinges. Though the hinges are very well made, the creaking is intentional. The door cannot be opened without making noise, and as an extension, alerting everyone inside- a sort of security feature built directly in, and maintained simply by negligence in oiling the hinges. Regardless, the door opens, revealing the figure of Madame Naoki. Having only just gotten back from St. James Boutique, she is in the process of preparing for the trip to Gauldin; various papers and documents related to diplomacy, foreign policy, and etiquette are littered all across her desk. Her hair is a bit out of sorts, and she adjusts it slightly as she greets Aithen. “Aithen, hello. How can I help you?”
---
“Right to the point, I see...”“I don’t have anything as pointed as that in mind, though. I didn’t invite you back here to sweet-talk you into doing some task for me, or make a one-time deal. I’ve invited you back here to establish and develop a relationship. You and I, we both stand to gain a lot from the other. I have the information, connections, resources, and tactical minds to know what ought to be done and arrange the logistical and command infrastructure to accomplish major feats. I’ve gotten this far without any truly high-profile warriors at my side. You have what I understand to be one of the greatest capacities to utilise magic in this generation. I heard about you before I even properly established my information network. I have multiple firsthand accounts of your power, and the things you’ve been able to accomplish essentially working out of your backpack. Working together, we each have the capacity to further the other’s agenda in massive ways. Naturally complimenting capabilities, if you will.”Naoki pauses, and takes a moment to swirl and then sip at her drink before continuing. “So I suppose the first thing I’d like to suggest is either employment in one of my organizations, or a formal alliance between us. The terms of either one of those are, of course, highly negotiable and largely up to you, but I can offer essentially anything. Access to the full extent of my knowledge for your discrete usage, and enough material resources and wealth to support your activities would presumably be standard, but I can offer so much more.”“Before we can get into that, though, what do you think? Are you willing to work with me?”Across the table, Naoki fixes her gaze on Jun in an attempt to accurately read her reaction.

From behind a stack of piled crates, Poros might see a tail protruding. A cat’s tail- a reddish brown, overly large one, at that. It twitches and swings about slightly, suggesting that the attached body is in motion. “Just a moment,” a female voice chimes out from behind the crates. There is some minor rustling from behind the crates, before the source of the voice steps out into view. It is, as one may have assumed, Madame Naoki. She stands there, arms piled high with scrolls. She is wearing a fine maroon blouse- the color of the Isranian flag, and a long black skirt. Considering Poros over the stack of scrolls, she greets him. “Ah! Mr. Welchion, I was expecting you. I am Madame Naoki, head of the Treasury Department. Have a seat, I’ll be with you in a moment.”With a tilt of the head, she indicates one of the only clean surfaces in the room, that of a simple wooden chair, sitting before the room’s singular desk, still piled high with documents.
---
Madame Naoki listens, and nods. “Alright, that’s a bit better. I’m not opposed to lending my aid to assist individuals who are being tortured. However, before I can do so, I need to know more about who I’d be rescuing them from. You say, ‘The Dungeons of Goraia’. I haven’t heard of these. I pride myself on knowing all there is to know regarding the locations of this world, and the events that transpire within it, but yet, I know not of Goraia. The only information I have relating to the name are some vague and unreliable rumors, that state that the sovereign nation of Medan is no more, and that an entity that refers to itself as Goraia stands in its place. Can you confirm these rumors? I dispatched scouts to verify them yesterday,  but they haven’t reached the border yet.”

Though her expression is hidden under the cloth covering her face, Madame Naoki’s tail twitches slightly at Tristian’s comment. Whether it is a twitch of amusement, irritation, or some other emotion altogether is up for debate, but the intonation of the words that follow is decidedly unfazed. “Not only presumptuous, but also preemptive. I’ve only just sat down. Have some patience, why don’t you. ”Naoki wiggles slightly to fit her tail more comfortably into the groove between the two planks that compose the bench, the motion displaying her curves enticingly. Whether this is intentional or not is entirely unclear. “I invite you to have a seat. If you’ve not experienced a sauna yet, you really should. Goodness knows you have a lot on your mind, and a sauna is an excellent remedy for a great variety of stresses. I probably owe my continued relative degree of sanity to regular sauna sessions. Don’t sit directly on the bench, though, get a towel. I usually find lying down preferable, but you may find that… difficult at the moment. Put a cloth over your face as I have if you find your face too hot.”

Madame Naoki nods as Ryden exists, satisfied. Another seemingly competent agent come seeking to be placed into her service. It’s pleasing to see that that particular trend hasn’t disappeared with the transition. The matter seemingly handled for now, Naoki returns to the task she was working on before Ryden’s entry. Which was… what. Dammit. Having lost track, Naoki selects something from the top of the pile and begins to apply herself to figuring out just what exactly needs to be done and doing it. As she does so, the purple gemstone embedded into her ear begins to glow with an ever-increasing intensity. At first, she continues to write, but soon places the quill down to lean back in her chair and divert the entirety of her attention to the telepathic communications. Whatever is going on is evidently somewhat troubling, as her eyebrows draw closer together and her mouth forms into a thin line. After perhaps a minute of this, she sits back up, locates a blank piece of parchment, and begins to write again, in slow, careful strokes.

Post 6:
Madame Naoki glances up from her work to see Ryden approaching again, but returns her gaze downward as he begins to speak, still scribbling away at the parchment on the desk. The attentive posture of her ears gives indication, however, that she is not ignoring him, and once he’s finished, she nods slowly, still concentrating on the document. “I’m aware, yes. Well, I should clarify - I’m aware of the situation in the plaza, but not the extent of the corruption within our ranks. I’ve already gone ahead and declared a low level state of emergency. The majority of Ministers are asleep, and this is a matter that needs to be dealt with only with the highest level of expediency. I’ll have no trouble justifying this tomorrow. To that end, however…”With a small flourish, she signs her name to the document, and slides it across the desk to Ryden. “That document is a direct order that removes the current head of the guard from power. This sort of thing was  his responsibility to prevent, and his complete failure to do so makes him unfit to hold his post.”With another application of her signature, Naoki completes a second document, and places it atop the first. “This document grants you emergency authority to temporarily take command of the guard. Not the military, mind you, just the city guard. Unfortunately enough, the majority of my trusted commanders are out of the city and therefore unable to assist, so it looks like you’ll be getting your position a bit sooner than we initially anticipated.”With that document finished and presented, Madame Naoki returns her quill to its holder and takes a deep, sighing breath. She was aware that Isra’s guard wasn’t quite the group of shining paragons that she would have liked them to be, but this level of corruption is far in excess of both her expectations and what she is willing to tolerate. Admittedly, Ryden’s waiver did not actually compel the guards to comply with his orders, but to blatantly ignore her signature is inexcusable. After composing herself, she stands in a slow, deliberate motion, leaving one palm spread on the desk. The expression on her face is not one of anger or rage, simply cold, quiet displeasure. “And this is me standing up to deal with the situation personally. If the guards will not respect my signature, they will be made to respect the underside of my boot. Take those documents and follow me. It’s time to send a message.”With that somewhat ominous statement made, Madame Naoki takes a moment to collect a few belongings from the desk, place them into the pockets of her trousers, and strides from the room, knowing Artemis will be right behind her and expecting Ryden to follow. On the way out, she also beckons to a pair of The Citadel’s honor guard, instructing them too, to fall in line behind her.

As Emahra finishes with her second bit, Madame Naoki simply looks on and nods slowly. After a pause, she responds, “You really do have a way with words.”“I’ll send for someone… probably some minister with nothing better to do. They’ll show you around and assist you in getting acclimated to Isra. I‘ll see to it that you’re provided for, lodgings and such. And then, let’s meet again in a week or so. By then I should have some idea about what sorts of specific tasks I’d like you to tackle and we can get you assigned to some… position or something. I’m sure I’ll find there are a few, and one of them will suit you.”With that said, Madame Naoki nods once again, with an air of finality. Another task put off for another day. Eventually, she supposes, her ability to schedule things for later is going to outpace how many hours there are in the days ahead. Not today, though. Still plenty of time of time for unnecessary introspection. She stands from her leaning position on the wall, and approaches Emhara, extending a hand, presumably for shaking. “It was a pleasure to make your acquaintance more fully, Ms. Emahra. You seem to be handling things exceptionally well, considering your circumstances, and if you need something I can provide, don’t hesitate to ask. I’ll look forward to having your assistance in the days ahead, and suspect that this may be the beginning of a long-lasting and mutually prosperous relationship.”

Kate’s explanation of her delayed arrival elicits a jokingly grumpy sort of pout and a “Hmmph” from Naoki. Idly, she wonders just what sort of spices are more important than attending such a large public function, and in the personal company of her, no less. Thinking slightly further, she wonders why Kate bothers with the public business side of her business anymore. It isn’t as if she needs the money, and if it’s preventing her from doing things she’d rather be doing, why even offer those sorts of services? She could just as easily ‘close’ her business and instead focus on the purely personal side of her talents, growing and maintaining her garden simply for the enjoyment of doing it. However, now isn’t the time to start discussing that sort of thing. Naoki has been waiting weeks for this event, and she isn’t about to sully the mood so soon with talk of business. Her pout gives way to the most pleased of smiles, and an affectionate arm finds its way around to rest on Kate’s hip as she takes her place on the couch. With her other arm, she gestures to Alden and Takhana. “Kate, this is Alden, and Takhana. High Marshal and Administrator of the Sun Marshals, respectively. I don’t think you’ve had the pleasure of meeting them properly, but what I said about the previously remains the case, I hold the pair of them in high regard; they do excellent work. Alden, Takhana; Kate. I think I’ve mentioned her once or twice.”
---
“The majority of the time, there won’t be any designated task or mission for you to attend to. Days and weeks may go by without any major assignments. Even with Ms. Untyrid mentoring you and dictating how you’ll spend your day, and even once your training is ‘officially’ complete, you’re going to find yourself with many hours to spend. However, as opposed to loafing about and spending your time on idle and meaningless pursuits, you will be expected to spend your time- at least the majority of it- well, by developing and increasing your own capabilities and serving the city in small ways.” “For example, your penmanship could use work.” With her left hand, Naoki gestures casually to the forms, intending to call Lamina’s less-than-stellar handwriting to attention. Taking another sip of her tea, Naoki finishes her cup and places it down upon the saucer with all due delicacy. “I would suggest that you spend some time reading and writing, practicing, refining your script, in the event you ever have to write anything in the scope of your assignments. Beyond that, and perhaps more importantly, I would also suggest that you spend a fair amount of time familiarizing yourself with Isra- sooner rather than later. As I understand, you’ve only been around for a few days- only since the tournament began or so. To be effective in operating within the city, you are going to need to know how to get from point to point, and know what individuals are referring to when they reference a location or another individual. Spend a few days in exploration for the sake of it. Perhaps Ms. Untyrid would give you a tour.” Naoki shrugs, unsure of how Emahra might decide to do things. Heck, she may not have even been notified yet. It's really too early in the morning to say, Naoki muses. Regardless, Naoki thinks that she’s made her suggestion clear enough. “Your goal should be to become as skilled, well rounded, and well versed as you possibly can be. To be able to intelligently approach any task that might be given you- no matter what it may be, and to have the skills required to deal with it. To quote a man I once knew…” Employing her skill of impersonation, Naoki adopts the voice of an elderly-sounding gentleman, of the sort you may expect to hear from a duke, or a scholar, perhaps. “An individual should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, forge metal, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.” Dropping the accent, Naoki continues in her own voice, “You’re not going to be expected to be able to do all of things, of course- that would be somewhat unreasonable and highly arbitrary, but I think I’ve made myself clear. Apply that philosophy to yourself and utilise the resources at your disposal to become the best and most qualified version of yourself you possibly can be.” Naoki punctuates her last statement with a solid nod, indicating that she's finished with that bit.

Taking the mug, Naoki casts a look in Alden’s direction, indeed attempting to assess him to some extent. She isn’t particularly successful, though. The relative lack of body language on his part is- beyond being somewhat off-putting, very good at masking whatever it is he’s thinking. Perhaps intentional. In response to his inquiry, Naoki begins to speak, “I’m… alright. … A bit tired. … A bit stressed; I’m beginning to be faced with an ever-mounting stack of difficult questions to answer and problems to solve without any real solutions, both personally and professionally. Those sorts of things are never any fun…” She trails off, taking a sip from the provided mug. After a moment, she decides to continue, “Honestly, in a way, I preferred the old problems. Poverty, and trying to make a living for myself and those close to me, as opposed to trying to wrangle the international economy to my ends. Going on dates as opposed to hosting summits. Organizing waiters and waitresses, as opposed to hierarchies of command. Writing up employment contracts as opposed to drafting international constitutions of human rights.” Pausing for a moment, to take a another sip from the mug, she realizes that she probably shouldn’t have mentioned that last bit. But whatever. Alden isn’t at the loose-lipped sort anyway. Naoki continues, “But otherwise, I’m doing fairly well. I mean, there’s certainly a lot of fulfillment in doing my job correctly- I can’t deny that, and I have a lot of power to improve lives, so I really can’t complain about much.” She shrugs, almost apologetically. In an effort to continue the conversation, she poses a question of her own, “How about…" Again, she gestures to the room around them, again intending to refer to the house and the situation in the general se.se "things here? Anything much more to report beyond the obvious? They’re growing very quickly.”

“Yes, merci,” Naoki thanks Claude for the drinks. As Liz poses her question, Naoki raises one incredulous eyebrow. “The purpose?” After mulling it over for a moment, she begins, “The purpose of this outing, and this vacation in general, for that matter, is such that you spend eighty percent of your time either in the barracks, in the pub, or on St. George. The purpose is that if I asked you what your hobbies were, you would probably say something silly, like, ‘maintaining my weapons’ or, ‘grooming St. George’.” At this, Naoki waves a hand dismissively as she uses the other to take a sip of wine, apparently not thinking very highly of either of the hobbies stated. “You probably don’t know how to dance, that’s probably one of the only dresses you own, and I am the only individual with which you have ever had sexual relations.” With this stated bluntly and with no apparent remorse, Naoki takes another sip of the wine before continuing, “Now, I don’t mean to imply that all of those things- dancing, dresses, and debauchery, are necessary for a healthy, full, and enjoyable lifestyle, but what I do mean to say is that your current lifestyle- of simply being a soldier, is unhealthy, and that you need to expand your outlook, find at least one reasonable hobby, and maybe develop some personal relationships with someone other than the soldiers under your command and yours truly.” Though there is a teasing edge to her voice, so too is there a serious one. Though she is directly berating Liz, Naoki intends for it to be clear that her intentions are motivated by a desire for Liz’ well-being. “There’s just… so much more to the world, and to life, than you’ve seen,” Naoki continues, gesturing around with her wine glass. “And again- I’m not implying that expensive wine and intimate settings are the be all and end all of what the world has to offer, but I, personally, enjoy this sort of thing, and would like to share it with you. … Such of the purpose of this date.” With this stated, Naoki nods once, mostly to herself, apparently satisfied with her choice of words, before proceeding to take a third sip of wine.
---
Content to leave the silence be, Naoki slides her plate off to one side and produces her menu from wherever she put it after ordering. More out of curiosity than anything else, she begins to peruse the dessert options. As she does, her left ear begins to twitch and swivel as it tends to do when she’s listening. Though Liz has had Naoki’s all but undivided attention for the past short while, this lull in their conversation allows Naoki time to listen, and more carefully assess the soundscape of the Scarlet Lounge. Among many inconsequential details from eavesdropping on the conversations of other diners, Naoki does divine one important bit of information: Upstairs, there is dancing, and nothing quite as lewd as she may have hoped. (Or at least if there is, they’re very quiet about it.) However, Naoki isn’t in any particular rush to proceed. The entirety of the evening and a fair portion of tomorrow morning have been set aside, so there’s no need to prompt Liz to proceed. However, Naoki does cast an eye toward Liz’ plate and the assorted appetizers in an attempt to plan her next few moves.

Upon catching sight of Naoki approaching, the mercenary stiffened for a moment before relaxing once more. He’d been on edge, but as Naoki neared, he did a quick scan for anyone in the vicinity who might overhear, finding no one. He remained silent, instead affixing Naoki with an intense gaze shortly thereafter.

Post 4:
Breaking out into a bit of a smirk as Arya seems to be getting into it, Naoki continues her ministrations right up until the point where Jun starts yelling and Arya pulls away. At this point, Naoki’s hands freeze in place while her ears wince at the sudden loud noise. She had been listening carefully to Arya’s murmuring, and it’s somewhat startling. Still, she recovers quickly enough and turns to observe as Jun smacks into the door.After Jun seems to have stopped and is sitting on the floor, Naoki lowers her hands to her sides slowly, exhaling deeply as she does so. The look on her face is one of exasperation and disappointment. Exasperation with Jun for being so difficult in this regard, and disappointment that she’s gone ahead and ruined- or at least thrown a wrench in what was going to be an excellent massage for Arya. She could have just quietly excused herself and left, rather than causing a fuss and startling everyone. Still, Naoki doesn’t have anything in particular to say. Jun doesn’t seem to be badly hurt and she’s far more qualified to treat herself than Naoki is, and Naoki doesn’t have any comments she’d like to voice aloud. So she simply crosses her arms under her chest, leans to rest primarily atop her right leg, and pouts her lips a bit, still eyeing Jun with some level of displeasure, but not so overtly as to be taken particularly seriously. In this manner, she stands silently, her effects on the atmosphere in the room still in place, but toned back down a tad.

Shrugging a bit and nodding her head, Naoki acknowledges Skarlet’s statements. It takes Naoki a few moments to parse the concept of not having at least one partner with which to do lewd things, but after a few moments, she responds, “Well, I think I sort of see what you’re getting at. Not quite sure what the best course of action might be, though. If all you’re looking to do is explore yourself, it would be very easy to simply invite anyone- you look good enough to get a queue of thirty or so gentlemen at any given point at The Sun, more if you announce as such beforehand.”“But I don’t think that’s quite what you want. Less quantity, more quality, and reliability. If I understand correctly, you’re looking for a partner, as opposed to just any stiff prick. And in that regard…”Naoki trails off for a moment, diverting her gaze to the side and ruminating for a few moments before continuing, “I’m not quite sure what advice to offer. Kate and I happened across each other more or less entirely by chance, and the relationship that followed is something that just sort of happened when we both came to the realization we were attracted to each other and it turned out that we’re compatible with some sort of romantic level that I can’t really speak to. Before I met her, I had no intentions of maintaining a romantic relationship of any sort- only ones of sexual nature, and that was and is very easy for me.”“... So I think the most you can probably do is start looking. If you come across someone that you think you might like to have a relationship with, talk to them, learn more about them, and try to see if your feelings are mutual. If they are- great, go ahead and take them on dates or however, and see how it turns out. Even if they’re not ‘the one’, there’s no innate harm in maintaining and then ending a relationship as so long as you’re careful about it and honest with yourself. If your feelings aren’t reciprocated, that’s also fine. There are lots of people in this world, you shouldn’t agonize about each one.”“Beyond that, I think you should be honest with yourself from the get-go. For a while, I had feelings for Kate but I was confused and unwilling to admit them to myself. Don’t do that. And consider what sorts of qualities you might like to see in the sort of person you’re looking for. You don’t have to be too specific, but for example, Kate is an optimistic person. She’s always bright and cheerful and looking at the better side of things. This serves to offset some of my pessimism and cynicism, and it’s very good for me to have someone to whom I can speak about personal problems and have them comfort me and tell me that it will be alright. I appreciate that in her a lot, and it leads me to doubt the possibility of maintaining a romantic relationship with someone who isn’t like that, or is too like myself as far as cynicism goes.”“But you might want someone who’s funny, who can make you laugh. Or someone who’s strong and protective of you. There are a lot of qualities that one can appreciate in another, and you should consider what sorts of qualities you might be looking for in a partner. It’ll give you some ideas about what you might want to look for. Similarly, you should consider what sorts of things you wouldn’t like to see in a partner. For example, I don’t very much like individuals who attempt to assert their dominance or superiority verbally. Talk is cheap and any king that has to say that he is the king is no real king. Someone who does that sort of thing would turn me off very quickly, and I would be unwilling to deal with them in any capacity more than I must. You ought to think about what qualities would make an individual unsuitable for you, and keep them in mind.”“As for actually locating individuals… I don’t have many ideas about that. There are lots of people in Isra. Lots of people come to The Sun and The Eclipse, and it would be fairly easy to approach them there. You could also try other establishments in Isra, or hang around The Citadel if you were so inclined. There are also plenty of people here in Gauldin. Lots of children of nobility who stand to inherit their parents’ holdings. That sort can often be conceited, but they’ve got good manners, generally speaking. You could also visit other nations- The Expanse might be good, or post some manner of notice that you’re seeking a partner. Young men would be crawling out of the woodwork to present themselves to you, and one might be to your liking.”With this, Naoki offers a shrug of her shoulders, as that’s most of what she has to offer for the moment. She remains as she is, sitting silently to gauge what Skarlet thinks about what she’s presented.

“Hmm. Interesting. … Alright, so noted. I’ll trust you to monitor the situation and take further action if you think it necessary.”Then Lady Naoki’s carriage arrives at the Northern Gate, slowing to a halt a short way past the portcullis- which is shut. Stan: Carriage Attendant First Class and Animal Handler Extraordinaire hops down from his seat at the front of the carriage, and begins to putter about the horses, petting them or whatever else it is he does.Jax: Carriage Attendant First Class & Master of Observation is in his usual place, with his torso protruding from the top of the carriage, spyglass in his hand. Though he can’t quite see the being that he was told of due to how there’s the large stone structure of the gate in the way, that doesn’t stop him from trying. Naoki herself, for her part, simply opens the rear door of the carriage and seats herself on the ledge. When Takhana had contacted her, Naoki had been wearing an off-white sweater with gray trousers, as he often tends to, and hasn’t changed since then. Here, she intends to wait for Emahra to arrive. Which shouldn’t be long, she figures.

Never one to pass up a good ogle, Naoki reciprocates Arya’s appraisal. For as accurate of a description Artemis provided, it is Naoki’s opinion that observing the article itself firsthand is vastly superior. Smirking slightly, Naoki notes with some amusement that it’s not very often that the other person is more eager than she is before she’s even begun to properly tease them. That’ll be the theme then, teasing, she decides. In any case, once Arya is laying down, Naoki doesn’t have anything in particular to say, so she opts simply to proceed. Having adequately gotten the massage oil onto her hands, Naoki proceeds to put one knee up on the table, and from there, move onto the table. She positions herself in such a way that she straddles Arya, with her knees on each side Arya’s hips, her feet resting near Arya’s knees. Such as it is, it’s impossible to avoid contact, so Arya might note that Naoki is quite warm. Perhaps unnaturally so. Simultaneously, Naoki dials back considerably on the portion of the magic granted to her which allows her to set the mood so perfectly. Down to a level that one might consider warm, but not quite hot. It wouldn’t do for Arya to give in before the fun really starts, and Naoki figures that she has much more experience managing individuals without any sort of influence than the alternative. Additionally, Naoki makes a point of holding her tail up so that it does not bump Forni. After pausing for a moment to allow Arya an initial reaction/shudder/what have you, Naoki adjusts herself slightly to be a bit more comfortable, and proceeds to inform Arya, in one of her lower voices, “I’m going to begin, take three deep breaths.”At this point, Naoki places her hands on Arya’s back, on her shoulder blades such that her thumbs are pointed upward toward the base of Arya’s neck, and her fingers are off to the side. In this manner, she proceeds to breathe with Arya, attempting to ensure that the other woman is relaxed. For as much as she intends to tease, the massage isn’t going to work very well if Arya is teetering on the edge the entire time.

“Well, if you had, I would have said that riding a griffin is not entirely dissimilar to riding a horse, but I suppose the comparison isn’t relevant.”As Lady Naoki is speaking, griffin-rider pairs ascend from the decks below to stand behind her on the weather deck. The Depravity, while not a dedicated vessel to the same extent that the Dawn Rider vessels are, has been built to accommodate a small group of griffins. Currently, these accommodations are being utilized by Sun Marshal griffins, and it is these griffins that now stand on the deck, along with their riders.“In any case,” Naoki continues, “their leadership must be removed. The only reason this pitiful excuse for a garrison is still making an effort is because there is someone in command over there lying to them, telling them they still have a chance.” One may pick up on a bit of bitterness in her tone at this. As she sees it, whoever’s in charge over there is either outrageously stupid or stupidly enamored by some worthless ideal like 'glory'. There isn’t any glory to be had in refusing to surrender at the cost of oh so many lives that are not yours to waste.Pausing for a moment, Lady Naoki takes one step toward Lamina, to draw her attention and make eye contact to make sure her next line is delivered with the appropriate emphasis, “So mount up.”After pausing the appropriate amount of time for dramatic effect, Lady Naoki, utilizing the end of the spyglass, gestures toward the griffins. The Sun Marshal riders seem to be about as Sun Marshals tend to be, though they are all wearing similar combinations of medium metal and leather armor, and carry short bows and bladed weapons of one type or another. The griffins wear armor is that seems quite similar to the armor one would find on a Dawn Rider griffin, save for a Sun Marshal badge being in the place of a Dawn Rider insignia. Upon cursory inspection, one would be able to see that one of the saddles is of the two-seated variety, and seems all but entirely unused. The griffin the double-saddle is affixed to seems to be named Eleanor, and the Sun Marshal leading Eleanor is Robin, according to their badges. Robin seems to be a tall woman, of somewhat strange proportions. It’s difficult to lay one’s finger on, but something about the way she’s structured that doesn’t seem quite right. But in any case, Robin seems professional enough and proceeds to mount Eleanor first, before turning expectantly toward Lamina.

The stage is set and the time is right. The yule log is in place, the barriers are erected, and the crowd is assembled. People begin to murmur as the sun — clouded over as it is, starts to dip past the horizon. They’re impatient, and rightfully so, because it’s damn cold outside. They would quite like to get this over with and get back inside, somewhere warm.Standing at the base of the yule log, Lady Naoki feels much the same way. She’s never one for the cold, and today is no exception. For this reason, she has chosen to wear one of her larger red coats — the double-breasted sort, with a high collar and appropriately regal trimmings. She’s paired this with an overly-long gray scarf that Grandma knit, the ends of which flap brazenly in the wind.A set of stairs has been hastily erected against the side of the log’s enclosure. Though it appears far from sturdy — as seems to be the trend with such constructions, it ought to be enough to fulfill its purpose tonight. At least, that’s what Lady Naoki hopes as she begins to ascend.With each step she takes, increasing numbers of eyes turn to look; a hush falls over the crowd. The fact presents itself: The Empress has chosen not to wear anything resembling pants.This stylistic choice is widely appreciated throughout the crowd, and by the time she’s reached the top, The Empress has their effectively undivided attention. For three beats, all is silent, and the wind gusts a bit. (Much to everyone’s excitement.) Then she begins.“People of Isra!” Her voice rings out clearly through the wind — courtesy of some magical trickery. “Friends! Neighbors! Citizens! Visitors! Strangers!” With each word, Naoki waves her torch in large arcs, pointing it at seemingly random portions of the crowd. “Welcome, to the First Annual Yuletide Celebration! The beginning of a tradition!” “As pre-cataclysm history goes, something called the Yuletide was once celebrated across the world; it was a time of peace and merry-making. Sources differ on the themes behind the holiday, but common are these: charity, feasting, fertility, and the celebration of successes and good harvests.”“In the time since Isra’s founding, we have found much success. While other nations falter and collapse under the pressures of poor leadership and lack of direction, we have stood strong! From nothing, we have built an entire Empire, where no one goes hungry, and all are free from the shackles of oppression! We have grown, we have prospered, and today, we stand proudly as the greatest power in the land!”“So, as these winter months set in, I say, why not? Why not celebrate, as they once did long ago? Let us now take some days to rest on our laurels! To give unto those less fortunate and those dear to us! Let us feast; let us drink! Let us love, and ensure many strong generations to follow!”“And finally, let us celebrate. Let us celebrate what we have accomplished and what is yet to come -- those closest to our hearts and our most far-flung countrymen! To Isra! And all that is good in this world!”With a suitably theatrical movement, The Empress hurls the torch over the wall.The effect is immediate.There is an audible roar as the fire spreads the entire length, and instantly consumes the log. It blazes some fifty feet up in the air. Along with fire comes the heat, a great big wave of it, washing out across the plaza. Some hats in the first few rows of the crowd are blown off, and poor Naoki is very nearly knocked off her platform.

Listening, Naoki smiles slightly, pleased to have gotten the reaction she did. She takes another sip of her beverage as Jun’s talking and swirls the remainder of her drink around in the glass until she’s finished. “I’m glad to hear it — glad to have your help, as always. There’s a meeting scheduled this evening where I’ll be meeting with my project managers; that will be a good place to discuss the specifics. Hold on to your ideas until then.”

“I have another, somewhat similar topic I’d like to broach -- that doesn’t necessarily have to do with Yuletide. I’m sure you’ll recall a few years past, we had a tournament? The Second Annual Grand? It was fine, for what it was, but too large an event.” Naoki’s free hand has entered the conversation, gesturing this way and that as she speaks.

“It was geared toward identifying potential Sun Marshals and hosting a tournament for the sake of the sport. In those regards, it did well — well enough to justify itself, but what I have in mind would have another focus. An apt name might be exhibition matches.” A pause as Naoki drinks.

“I think it would be an amazing spectacle to see Isra’s most powerful heroes and greatest champions face off in the arena. Entertainment for the spectators, practice and prizes for the combatants, and a display of power to all those who would fancy themselves, enemies. I have high hopes, and I would like to know what you think — if you would be amenable to participating in such an event.”

The Empress remains exactly as she is until the doors close behind Venus, Once they do, she lowers her arm and begins to breathe deeply. With the subject out of sight, she’s able to simmer down to a low boil—a controllable level of anger. Grumbling and muttering expletives, she stares at the door through which Venus left. “How dare she.” The room is dead silent. Venus said something there but The Empress did not hear. Perhaps she’ll look at the transcript later, perhaps she won’t.

“There will be no more court today,” declares The Empress, standing. “Save the rest of those things for later,” she instructs the listboy, “And go.”Stalking out the side door, The Empress leaves, with the intention to go blow off steam. After a moment, the assembled guards and courtiers break formation, moving to stand and exit. There is a hushed tension about them. None of them quite understand what happened there, but The Empress was Upset. Rarely does The Empress get upset, and rarer still does she display anger.

Lady Naoki is relaxing on the throne as her guest enters, idly twirling a quill in her left hand. In truth, she’s been lounging about for a few minutes now, but the musician only just rolled in with a fantastic hangover. Considering that, he’s playing very well.

While the masked man approaches, looking around, she eyes him. Tall, isn’t he. Frankly, she had been expecting an ‘Archbishop’ to seem a bit less... grim? Naoki knows honest-to-goodness monsters who look cheerier than this fellow. If he makes a religious pretense and dresses like that, it’s easy and quite tempting to start making assumptions. But She refrains, figuring whatever he says will be better.

“Greetings,” Lady Naoki begins lightly, “Welcome to Isra.”She motions for him to stand. “With whom do I have the pleasure of speaking?”
---
“Hello, Venus.” Naoki launches right into it. “I apologize for being short with you yesterday.” “I initially wanted to speak to you regarding The Summit, but when you entered, looking like you did, I became exceptionally upset, to the point of unable to hold a discussion.”
“Since then, I’ve had time to settle and consolidate my thoughts, so now I will say this, and you will listen:”
A brief pause as Naoki searches her pouch. “I have a unique relationship with Kate Green, the woman on the silver coin.” Naoki holds up a silver coin for Venus to see before bringing it back into her palm to gaze at as she continues speaking. “I love her very much, for reasons and in ways that are quite personal and very important to me. If you were previously unaware, now you are not.” The coin goes back into the pouch.
“When you walked into this room yesterday looking like her, with her hair, her eyes, and so on, that upset me because you are not her. You are so very much not her, to such an extent I found it revolting and highly offensive. Not because it was itself ugly, but because it was a distorted, imperfect perversion of the original.”
“Now, I am not asking you to understand any of what I’ve just said. I am not asking you to understand the mortal concept of love or how I feel or why I feel the way that I do. What I am telling you is this: You are going to leave my personal life alone. You are going to leave Kate alone, not assume her likeness, or concern yourself with her in any way. You are not going to bring it up, talk about it, mention her in passing, imply things about it, gossip about it, or do anything at all remotely related to Kate or the relationship I share with her.” Maintaining direct eye contact, Naoki counts these items off on her fingers as she lists them.
“You will say, ‘very well,’ or ‘as you wish,’ or something to that end—with a snarky remark if you’d like, and then that will be the end of it, we’ll move on to why I initially wanted to speak to you: The Summit, and we will not come back to this.” Having reached the end of her prepared statement, Naoki gestures with finality. “... I believe I’ve expressed myself clearly but was any of that unclear to you? I want to avoid misunderstandings later.”

Post 10:
Shrouded in darkness on the second-floor balcony, The Empress sits alone, out of sight from the patrons below. A Sentinel standing in the door is to see that she’s not disturbed. As she sips her drink, she’s hit by a wave of melancholy that’s been haunting her for a long time. It’s not the same. To anyone who had ever visited The Midnight Sun, The Starlight Dawn is astonishingly similar. Though somewhat larger, the builders were instructed to mimic The Sun as well as they could, and they’ve done admirably in that goal. The same floorplan, the same types of wood, the same paintings on the wall, the same sort of candles, the same detailing on the banisters, and even the very same mural overhead, right down to the dimple on the cherub’s bum.

To most, The Starlight Dawn is just a bigger, better Midnight Sun in a more convenient location. Some even go so far to say that it was a good thing The Midnight Sun was destroyed because at least they have some elbow room now (haw haw haw.)

But when such sour comments reach The Empress’ pointed ears, they flatten against the top of her head in anger and abject disgust. Prior to her election, back when it was Madame instead of Empress, The Midnight Sun was Naoki’s everything. The seat of her power, the sum of her wealth, her business, her organization, her base of operations, her family, and her home.

After becoming Lady of Isra she no longer had time to stay at The Midnight Sun, what with a city to be responsible for and all. So she transferred management of The Sun to a trusted friend — Calico Shwartz, and began spending more and more time at The Citadel and abroad, administrating her domain, tending to the needs of her people and growing her empire. But as she cast her gaze further and further and as she set her goals higher and higher, as she brought Isra to new heights of power and prosperity, the life she had down in the little tavern gradually faded away, as did everyone in it.

A few of her old friends stayed with her, and for that, she is grateful. Alden, Liz, and of course, Grandma — invaluable allies all; without them, neither she nor the world at large would be in as good of shape as they are today. But the rest are gone, their names forgotten. Left to pursue opportunities elsewhere. Killed by Goraia’s artifact. Vanished into The Mists. Artificial body finally gave out. Assassinated. Dragged back to the Hellscape. Overdose. Several counts of killed in battle … And most of all, abandoned her in search of a fucking plant.

Face contorted in anguish, Naoki is aware that she’s just indulging the feeling at this point, but she doesn’t care. This isn’t the first time she has sat alone on the second-floor balcony and felt bad for herself, but it is the first time she’s had to do it in this hollow mockery of a building. The bombing of The Midnight Sun was the last nail in the coffin; what was once hers is now gone, forever. 

She can’t go sit in her office and remember the memories she made there; she can’t order her old favorite dish and find comfort in its familiar taste. She can’t look at the stains on the table and scuffs on the floor to remember how they were made, and she can’t hear the familiar groan of the steps as she climbs them, because now it’s all just splinters and rubble. For all the power she has — political, influential, cosmic, demonic, and otherwise — for all the gold in her vaults, — for all the Legionaries at her command and all the ships in her navy, — for all of her adoring subjects, all those lives that have been saved as a result of her decisions, and for all who have died in her name — for all of it, here she sits. Here sits The Empress, here sits Naoki. Alone. In the dark. In a replica that which she lost, drinking a replica drink out of a replica glass, lamenting what she used to have and how sorry she is for having lost it. The noise dampening runes in the table ensure that her wailing sobs can’t be heard by the patrons below, but at this moment, she wouldn’t even care if they did. She traded everything she had for the entire world and is only now appreciating the depth of her loss.

Post 20:
Naoki’s mouth (a thin line parallel to her furrowed eyebrows) slides from one side of her face to the other and back. She knows that Grandma isn’t the sort for purely social visits. Still, Naoki was hoping that whatever matter Grandma wanted to discuss was, perhaps related to her recent trip, developments in any of their ongoing projects, foreign policy, or really anything at all less personal than the subject of succession.

“Not… overly,” Naoki supposes, tucking the diagram back into her robe.

“It’s undoubtedly an important matter deserving of a great deal of thought — which I give it, but I’ve explored the options as they exist right now,  and decided that I’ll not be settling for half-measures or someone ‘good enough’. Before I vacate the throne, I will find, designate, train, and prepare my successor to precisely the extent I see fit. The feelers are out, the eyes are open, but the process, even just of finding them, will likely take years — as it probably should.”

Taking a seat opposite Grandma, Naoki kicks off her slippers, such that she might better feel the warmth of the fireplace on her feet. Slumped low in her chair, she's quiet for a long moment, staring into the fire with a blank expression.

“The weight of the world — yes, weighs as heavily on my mind and soul as it ever has. The novelty has worn thin; I don’t really want to be The Empress anymore. It’s become tiring to look at just about anyone and reflect how they are, in many ways, freer than I — ruler of The Free City, to do as they please without consequence.”

"But I can’t leave the throne in good conscience because I am the source of Isra’s current state of peace and prosperity. I am critical to the continued health of — it’s millions, now — in the most literal sense. I would love to be able to travel the world and spend my days doing things of zero consequence whatsoever, but people would die, and I don’t believe that’s an exaggeration. The most my successor(s) will ever be able to do is make Isra’s fall as slow and gentle as possible, and knowing all of this isn't exactly the most wonderful feeling I've ever experienced.”

“But you know this,” Naoki continues, gesturing at Grandma, “I know this, and in fact, most anyone with a clue probably has some idea of it. What prompts your question?”
---
Post 41:
“Why do you care?” Naoki says.  It is not so much a retort as it is a rhetorical question. "Really: why, do, you, care?"

“Why do you care what happens down here among mortals? Why do you care enough to do what you do? You will keep on living for millennia more, long after all of this — the whole Overworld, has faded to dust, so what does any of this matter to you?” Naoki asks, gesturing all around them.

Without waiting for an answer, she continues. “The only possible explanation is that you are entirely self-motivated. You’re motivated by you and only you — your personal desire for power and knowledge and whatever else, and the only reason you do any of this is in pursuit of that. You associate with me because you think I’m quaint, ‘unique’ among all the innumerable mortals you have seen come and go — and you’ve turned my ‘uniqueness’ into a tool that furthers your own aims!” 

“You are motivated by yourself, but I am not like you. The reason that I get up in the morning and do things is that I only have but so many mornings to do things with! Since my life is finite, it is my responsibility to do with it what I want. I am motivated by a sense of compassion for my fellow man, which is rooted in the idea that all of our collective lives are finite and we must work together to make them as good as we can. I am motivated by my sense of duty to the Isran people because I have assumed responsibility for their lives and it is thus my responsibility to do well by them," she continues. "I desire power not for its own sake, but for the power to do as I’d like with my life, and the lives of those I am responsible for.”

“All of these feelings are predicated on my being mortal — and that’s why you don’t feel them,” Naoki continues, sticking one accusatory finger at Grandma. “If something were to happen to me, you would be upset not out of the compassion humans feel for one another, but because I was useful to you!” She nearly spits.

Then she catches herself. “... Which is not to say that I harbor any ill-feelings against you,” Naoki clarifies, aware of her tone. “I continue to appreciate all that you have done, I mean no insult in saying any of this, apologize for taking that tone with you, don’t hold who you are against you, and all of that.”

“But,” She continues, sighing, “That’s the way it is.”

“And, respectfully, I don’t want to be like you. I want to remain mortal because I want to continue to feel. All of those human feelings of caring, greed, love, duty, anguish? I live on those feelings, and I thrive on the fulfillment derived from them. To lose that would be to lose that which makes me, me. Who I am and my reason for being.”

She pauses.

“Now, admittedly, I’ll likely end up staying a good bit longer than is my fair share,” she concedes, “But I can’t live forever. I don’t want to accrue incredible power or rule the world — that’s not what I’m about. The idea of watching the world age and pass me by as I remain the same, an immortal observer, is appalling. ... I fear becoming immortal because I have nothing to gain and everything to lose. There’s no good reason to,” she concludes, shrugging. It's well-justified in her mind.

Post 50:
Naoki nods along and accepts the skin, sniffing it briefly to determine the contents before taking a modest swig and returning it. She follows right up to the mention of The Mindaugas and his mace, whereupon she falters in her step, does a double-take, and looks to Rudiger, incredulous. “The one I need to worry about?” It seems as though Naoki is taking these legends rather seriously. “You mean to tell me that by crowning you, I will raise a revenant intent on blood? Whose blood? For what purpose? To serve the Duke? To 'protect the land'?” She exhibits a moderate amount of concern. She doesn't truly fear such a thing, but it's far from trivial.

After Rudiger is finished speaking, Naoki is quiet for a few moments. Then she hums — as one does when they’re informed of such things.

“Lovely,” she remarks. “Glad  to hear they have come to resent me so quickly.” The sarcasm is thick, but she refrains from making any additional snarky comments. Instead, Naoki nods, internalizing the information. It doesn’t seem as though she’s surprised or particularly bothered by the notion of civil unrest amongst Vortuans. Really, it would be unreasonable for her to expect them not to dissent when their land is in such a state.

“You’ll have quite a time building your public image,” she supposes to Rudiger. “Once you’ve established yourself, we’ll probably end up arranging narratives wherein you ‘negotiate’ with me to lower taxes, slide borders around, or what-have-you.” A wavy gesture implies that it doesn’t matter overmuch to Naoki what those changes may end up being so long as they serve their purpose. “Continue.”

Post 86:
“Mmh, no, I preferred it the first way…”

Trailing off, she gathers her thoughts.

“This entails a bit of storytime: … I was here, not quite at the city’s initial founding, but not long after. I had essentially nothing and, compared to what it has become, The Free City was hardly anything at all. I was presented with the opportunity to assume management of a dingy little bar called ‘The Midnight Sun’, for reasons that remain unclear to me to this day. Suffice it to say that I did quite well. We made gold hand over fist, and I gradually grew the business and organization into much more than a mere tavern.”

“It wasn’t very long that I found myself with those things which I had lacked, gold and allies, in grand abundance. It became a sort of a game to see how much gold I could make and how wide I could extend my influence. And what I found was that as I accumulated wealth and power, I was better able to provide for those fellow demihumans who found themselves much as I had. I inducted them into the organization, gave them jobs, gave them purpose, put clothes on their backs, fed them, and gave them a warm bed to sleep in -- all those things that were never given to me.”

“I found all this to be immensely gratifying. It appeals to that base part of my psyche that compels humans to cooperate toward the greater good. I get off on receiving gratitude in that manner, and the associated luxuries were an excellent bonus.”

“The scope of those I took responsibility for continued to grow, as did my power to care for them. There was a point at which none in Isra could oppose me, and another where I effectively gained control of the city. When I was elected Lady of The Free City, it was mostly a formality, but it actualized my duty to protect. At that moment I became responsible for the lives of every man woman and child living in Isra, and I carry that duty to this day.”

“Since then, I have dramatically increased both my power and the number of lives I take responsibility for, but my underlying motivations remain the same. Throughout my Empire, there are millions of Isran citizens who, whether they outwardly recognize and appreciate it or not, owe the very basis of their lives to me. They sleep soundly at night protected by the armies I raise. Their homes were built by the programs I organized. They bathe in the bathhouse I paid from my own pocket to construct, and I have even gone so far to provide food to those who have none.” It goes on, but she doesn’t.

“I have done good in this world,” Naoki asserts, “And I feel good about it.”

“At this point, it has become less of a choice and more of a compulsion, because I must continue to work as hard as I do to keep it all from falling apart, but I have become affectionate toward this Empire I’ve built and these people I’ve raised. As it stands, I am the only one who can do what I do, and so I continue for their sake.”
