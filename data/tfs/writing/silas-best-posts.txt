The tavern was sparsely occupied. Silas went to the bar and ordered a pint of ale and whatever was hot and cheap for supper.  Looking a round he spotted a fine spot by the hearth that had a view of the door. Taking his beer he retired to the spot, leaning his shield, with spear strapped to it, against the wall.  His sword he leaned against the arm of the chair, always within reach. Sitting at a table near him was a young man with a boyish face.  Resting against the table was a monstrous long bow of black yew, larger then any Silas had seen.  Further examination of the boy revealed a slightly muscular build.  He certainly didn't look like a strong man, but his muscles were toned by years of using a long bow.  He must be a good shot, Silas mused.  Just then the boy must have noticed Silas looking for he made eye contact and one hand discretely slipped up his sleeve. "Greetings friend." Silas said raising his mug. "That's quite a bow you've got there." The boy seemed to relax.  Shrugging he said, "It is normal where I'm from.  We start learning the bow at a young age. The names Oliver." "Silas, pleasure to meet you Oliver. What causes a boy like you to leave home?" "Boy!" Oliver replied slightly indignantly.  "I am 17 and a man." Oliver thumped his chest.  "I am tired of the life of a farmer and shooting rabbits, grouse, and deer bores me.  I left to seek adventure, battle, glory, and riches." Silas smiled.  Just the sort of man he had been looking for.  Guilt tinged his emotions though.  "And have you shot a man with that bow yet?  There is a difference between killing a deer and killing a man..." Silas trailed off thinking of the past.  Unconsciously he stroked the pommel of the sword by his side. "No, but I...well...when the chance comes I'll...what makes you an expert on killing, old man?" The tone was accusatorial. Silas raised an eyebrow.  "Well if you are a man I guess that does make me an old man." Silas smiled.  "I have been in a few skirmishes myself and killed more men then I can count.  Glory in battle?  Most who have seen real fighting would disagree.  I believe those men to be cowards not cut out for battle." Silas still stroked the sword. "Really!?" Oliver leaned forward all reservation gone.  "Tell me what it's like?  Were they large battles?  Were you an officer or just a soldier?  Did you fight any trolls or other beasts? Who did you fight for?  Who won? What was the-" "Easy kid." Silas interrupted.  "They were just skirmishes over a border dispute.  I was only a soldier and I doubt you would know who I fought for...they no longer exist in the histories." "So you lost." It was not a question. "I survived. Tell me Oli, which way are you headed?  Towards Medan or away?" "Away, into the wilderness, that's where adventure is to be found." "Adventure can be found everywhere." Silas responded. "Let me give you some advice, Oliver, when you fight don't fight for a cause.  Lose a fight like that and, if you live, you'll be left in disgrace.  Fight for gold or fight for glory.  That way you will always come out on top...unless you are dead of course.  How would you like to join me?  I am looking to put together a company of sorts." "What kind of company?" Oliver seemed intrigued. "A mercenary band, at first.  Then we shall see." "Yes!  I'll join you." Oliver said with little hesitation. Silas's meal came and he gestured for Oliver to take the seat opposite him.  The young archer complied and Silas raised a toast. "To adventure, battle, glory, riches, and more." "Hurra!" Oliver whooped, clinking mugs and drinking deeply.

After spending the night in the tavern Silas and his new found companion, Oliver, made their way east along the Decrepit Road.  As they got deeper into the forest, still the Usque ar Ñalma Forest Silas believed, the road became narrower and less used. After passing a burnt patch on the ground the road dwinded into little more then a game trail. "So...uh...I guess we go back?" Silas said a little disappointed.  Sure there had been no maps of this area, but Silas had been certain that it would lead somewhere...or at least not into the middle of nowhere. "No way!" Oliver replied.  "Don't you know the legends about this forest?" "Uhhh..." Pursuing lost legends?  This is not what Silas had in mind. "I heard from my brother, who had it from a friend, who talked to a traveler, who was told by an little old dwarf." "Wha-" Silas tried to interject but Oliver went on over him. "Somewhere in this forest is a lost city, an entrance to both the Misty Forest and the Deer Woods, and when we make it through we will be in the Midlands where I have heard of even more wonderful sights, like floating islands and the misery mists, or something like that, and then..." Oliver paused to breath and Silas interjected. "You do know those are all just legends?  No one has ever actually seen them.  If we wander aimle-". Oliver cut him off. "Yes but the dwarf said-" "A DWARF!" Silas said in a half shout.  "Have you ever even seen a dwarf?" "No." Oliver said softly. "But there is nothing left back in Medan." This caused Silas to pause.  This boy was so naive.  There were plenty of adventures to be had in Medan...but for himself?  There was, in fact, nothing left for Silas in Medan and the thought of returning made him grit his teeth.  "Fine," he said with a sigh, "we continue." "Hurra!" Oliver whooped. "We head South!" "But the trail goes east?" Silas said incredulously. "Meh, this is only a deer trail, see that skat?  It will either lead us in circles or nowhere.  Anyways, I heard of a place called the Free Plains somewhere to the south." Oliver seemed confident but Silas was not so sure. "How will we avoid getting lost though?" Silas was no woods man. "We'll be fine." Oliver said, slipping a knife from his sleeve and making a mark on a tree trunk. "Moss grows on the northern side of the trees and if we need to we can follow these marks back." Sighing Silas let Oliver lead the way into the Forgotten Usque.

That night Silas reflected on the days trek through the forest.  He was impressed with Olivers resourcefulness.  The young man had found game trails to make the journey easier and had pointed out plants such as devils club and stinging nettles to avoid touching.  Strangely though, Oliver had continued to pick and collect the nettles after telling Silas not to touch them.  Apparently they could be used to make tea and were nutritional.  Silas tried to help, grabbing a plant by the stalk and yanking it from the ground. The result was an itchy rash on the hand. "You can only touch the top of the leaves." Oliver had explained as he picked a fern.  "The sori on the bottom of this fern should sooth the itching. Don't worry it won't get any worse then it is now and should be gone by tomorrow." The pollen from the fern really had helped. Their camp consisted of a basic lean to, a fire pit, and a strange rack of sticks and leaves Oliver claimed he would use to preserve any meat he found.  Oliver produced some flint and steel, giving it to Silas telling him to make a fire while he went hunting.  Fire made, Silas sat on a mossy rock and relaxed.  A rustle of bushes announced Oliver returning, a deer slung across his back.  "What if that was one of those talking deer?" Silas joked, then laughed as Oliver turned pale.  "Don't worry.  I doubt they even exist." Silas was further impressed as Oliver continued to gut the dear and make a stew (he had some cooking utensils in his shoulder bag) with nettles, mushrooms, tubers, and blessedly some salt.  The rest of the meat he smoked with the contraption he had made earlier.  "What a meal." Silas said patting his belly. "For that I'll take first watch." "A watch??" Oliver complained.  "Why do we need to keep watch?" "Something seems a little eery about this forest...Don't you agree?  Anyways, I have heard some strange stories about this place myself. Get some sleep.  Tomorrow I will start teaching you to fight with the sword and spear." Oliver agreed and crawled into the lean to, wrapping his cloak around himself.  Returning to his rock Silas scanned the forest.  It really was eery.  Sticks cracked under the feet of animals unseen except, occasionally, their eyes, and strange birds hooted.  The most disconcerting were the sounds that Silas could not identify.  Silas stoked the fire.

Silas had managed to get lost on the way to the Mustering grounds.  He had finished his booze and was contemplating a nap under a bush when he heard the bugle blowing just on the other side of the shrub.  "therrs my arrrmy,"  Silas slurred as he mad his way through the bushes.  Stepping out of the bushes Silas came face to face with the army and paused.  It had been a long while sense he had seen such a sight and for the first time in a long time his blood began to heat up with real excitement.  Butterflies fluttered in his stomach as apprehension and fear joined in. Temporarily the emotional cocktail sobered him up. Unconsciously he straightened and for a moment looked more like a soldier then a deadbeat drunk.  Then as the initial shock and adrenaline wore off the dull haze of a fading drunk returned.  Silas slouched then swayed up to the first official looking person he saw.  "We're leavin al'eady?"

At the sound of a crash Silas peered out of the booth to find Badger taking to two of the biggest mugs of beer Silas had ever seen."Shyit, I must have dies and gone to heaven. Hic. Don't remember anything after the Knight's Rest. But damn! I have been so hungover and drunk at the shame time. Hic." Silas found that he still could not think straight.  The little gnomes words seemed to be coming from the other side of a wall."Can't ssay it's the strangest gal I've been with." Silas responded, not knowing how close to the trues he was, "But that's because I can't remember thing! Ha! Next one's on me all right, buddy ol' pal!"  Silas raised his mug to give cheers, sloshing more of the froamy stuff to the floor. The already drunk mercenary took two long pulls before retching the mug away from his mouth, spilling an unreasonable amount down his front.  He turned his head to the side (away from Badger) and promptly vomited far more then he had just drank. Peering into his mug Silas found that it was still more then half full!"Whooo!" He shouted before lifting the mug to drink once again.
